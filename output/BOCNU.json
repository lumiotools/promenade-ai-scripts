It will expand its brand portfolio of millennial- and Gen Z-targeted Chinese, Japanese and English digital products and widen the reach of its AI-driven analytics, advertising and marketing technology products.\n\n\"We are perfectly positioned to serve younger audiences in the world's most dynamic region with products that are built just for them,\" Joey Chung, the company's chief executive and co-founder said. \"We are independent of existing media groups, determined to preserve our independence and focused on using technology to deliver the right content to our audiences and customers at the right time in the format that they want it.\"\n\nTNL Mediagene was formed in May 2023 by the merger of Taipei-based The News Lens Co. (TNL), which through rapid growth and strategic acquisitions over the last decade has become a leading independent, pan-Asian digital-media group, and Tokyo-based Mediagene Inc. (MG), Japan's leading digital media company, which was founded 25 years ago and today includes a number of original and licensed Japanese-language brands, including Business Insider Japan, GIZMODO JAPAN, Lifehacker Japan, DIGIDAY JAPAN, ROOMIE and MASHING UP. Combined, measured by Google Analytics, the group's brands reach an average of more than 50 million users each month.\n\n\"By combining forces, TNL and Mediagene have created a first-class, pan-Asian digital-media group,\" Mediagene CEO and founder Motoko Imada said. \"By becoming a public company in the U.S., we would also like to continue to grow with the support of international investors, with the goal of becoming a media company that connects the world by providing reliable information about Asia, including Japan, to the rest of the world.\"\n\nRichard Leggett, Blue Ocean's chief executive, said: \"This transaction brings together the dramatic growth stories already written by TNL and Mediagene, offering best-in class regional content with powerful AI-powered MarTech and AdTech that positions the group to succeed in one of the world's fastest growing regions.\"\n\nBlue Ocean itself was founded and is run by investors with deep media, operating, investing and international experience and is backed in part by North Base Media, a global media-focused venture-capital firm.\n\n**Transaction Details**\n\nPursuant to the business combination agreement for the transaction, Blue Ocean will merge with a wholly owned subsidiary of TNL Mediagene with Blue Ocean surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of TNL Mediagene (the \"Merger\"), and TNL Mediagene becoming a publicly listed company on the NASDAQ. As a result of the Merger, outstanding shares and warrants of Blue Ocean will be canceled and converted into the right to receive equivalent shares and warrants of TNL Mediagene. The transaction gives TNL Mediagene a pre-money enterprise value of approximately $275 million.\n\nIn connection with the Merger, Blue Ocean Sponsor LLC, a Cayman Islands limited liability company and certain insiders and other shareholders holding Class B common shares in Blue Ocean have agreed to defer receipt of the shares of TNL Mediagene that they will receive pursuant to the Merger for up to 36 months.\n\nThe Boards of Directors of TNL Mediagene and Blue Ocean, respectively, have approved the transaction. The transaction will require approval of the shareholders of Blue Ocean and TNL Mediagene and is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n**Advisors**\n\nSidley Austin LLP and Lee and Li are serving as legal advisor and Needham & Company, LLC is serving as financial and capital markets advisor to Blue Ocean. Morrison & Foerster LLP is serving as legal advisor to TNL Mediagene.\n\n**About TNL Mediagene**\n\nTNL Mediagene, a Cayman Islands-registered company, is the product of the May 2023 merger of Taiwan's The News Lens Co. and Japan's Mediagene Inc., two leading, independent digital-media groups.

We may not sell these securities until the registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is effective. This preliminary prospectus is not an offer to sell these securities and it is not soliciting an offer to buy these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not permitted.\n\nSUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED NOVEMBER 8, 2021\n\nPRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS\n\n![](logo_blueocean.jpg)\n\n$150,000,000\n\nBlue Ocean Acquisition Corp\n\n15,000,000 Units\n\nBlue Ocean Acquisition Corp is a newly incorporated blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination. We have not identified any potential business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any potential business combination target.\n\nThis is an initial public offering of our securities. Each unit has an offering price of $10.00 and consists of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant entitles its holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as described in this prospectus. Only whole warrants are exercisable. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. The warrants will become exercisable on the later of 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination and 12 months from the closing of this offering, and will expire five years after the completion of our initial business combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation, as described in this prospectus. Subject to the terms and conditions described in this prospectus, we may redeem the warrants once the warrants become exercisable. The underwriter has a 45-day option from the date of this prospectus to purchase up to 2,250,000 additional units to cover over-allotments, if any.\n\nWe will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest (net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described in this prospectus. If we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended, as described in more detail in this prospectus), we will redeem 100% of the public shares for cash, subject to applicable law and certain conditions as described in this prospectus.\n\nOur sponsor, Blue Ocean Sponsor LLC, and Apollo SPAC Fund I, L.P., a fund managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc., have agreed, pursuant to separate written agreements, to purchase an aggregate of 7,750,000 warrants (or 8,650,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full), each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as provided herein, at a price of $1.00 per warrant, in a private placement to occur concurrently with the closing of this offering. Our sponsor will purchase 7,650,000 warrants (or 8,550,000 warrants if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) and Apollo will purchase 100,000 warrants.\n\nApollo has expressed to us an interest to purchase up to an aggregate of $14,985,000, or 9.99%, of units in this offering at the public offering price, and we have agreed to direct the underwriter to sell to Apollo such amount of units, subject to our satisfying the Nasdaq Global Market, or Nasdaq, listing requirement that we have a minimum of 400 round lot holders of our units. Because this expression of interest is not a binding agreement or commitment to purchase, Apollo may determine to purchase more, fewer or no units in this offering or the underwriter may determine to sell more, fewer or no units to Apollo. For a discussion of certain additional arrangements with Apollo, see “Summary — The Offering — Expression of Interest.”\n\nOur initial shareholders currently own an aggregate of 4,312,500 Class B ordinary shares (up to 562,500 of which will be surrendered to us by our sponsor for no consideration depending on the extent to which the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised). The total number of Class B ordinary shares outstanding after this offering and the expiration of the underwriter’s over-allotment option will equal 20% of the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares outstanding at such time. The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder thereof, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment, as described in this prospectus. Only holders of Class B ordinary shares will have the right to appoint directors prior to or in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and may remove members of the board of directors for any reason. On any other matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, holders of Class B ordinary shares and holders of Class A ordinary shares will vote together as a single class, except as required by law.\n\nCurrently, there is no public market for our units, Class A ordinary shares or warrants. We have applied to have our units listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “BOCNU” on or promptly after the date of this prospectus. We cannot guarantee that our securities will be approved for listing on Nasdaq. We expect the Class A ordinary shares and redeemable warrants comprising the units to begin separate trading on Nasdaq under the symbols “BOCN” and “BOCNW” respectively, on the 52nd day following the date of this prospectus (or, if such day is not a business day, on the next succeeding business day) unless Needham & Company, LLC permits earlier separate trading and we have satisfied certain conditions.\n\nWe are an “emerging growth company” and a “smaller reporting company” under applicable U.S. federal securities laws and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. No offer or invitation to subscribe for securities may be made to the public in the Cayman Islands.\n\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk.

We have not identified any potential business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any potential business combination target.\n\nAlthough we may pursue our initial business combination in any business, industry or geographic location, we intend to concentrate our sourcing efforts within the high-growth internet, media and adjacent industry segments, including online marketplaces, content and subscription management, education and training, advertising technology and direct-to-consumer businesses (collectively the “Internet & Digital Media Sector”) with initial enterprise valuations between $750.0 million and $2.0 billion. We intend to seek opportunities globally, with a particular emphasis on large-population, high-growth emerging regions in Asia and Latin America, as well as in North America, including the United States. \n\nWe believe there has never been a better time to invest in the Internet & Digital Media Sector. In emerging regions, the number of people who are just accessing the mobile internet for the first time (“the next billion”) continues to grow rapidly in large-population, middle-income countries. Demand is growing among these new audiences for news, sports and e-sports, entertainment, education, services, business information and data. Online education, e-commerce and marketplace opportunities are growing rapidly in these emerging regions. The wide distribution of data analytics, software tools, artificial intelligence and social-media platforms is allowing entrepreneurs globally to optimize products for these new audiences in ways not previously available.\n\nIn addition, business founders and operators in emerging regions have limited options for listing on deep or liquid exchanges in their home regions and may consider a listing on a U.S. stock exchange as an important benchmark of success. A U.S. listing can also serve as a critical catalyst for growth for these businesses while providing U.S. investors with exposure to emerging market secular growth opportunities. We believe that premise will bolster our global efforts to identify and consummate a successful business combination with a strong, fast-growing company seeking a U.S. public listing. \n\nWe believe we are well positioned to identify these opportunities. Our management, directors and advisors have deep experience operating public companies, investing globally and guiding financial transactions, including taking companies private and public. Our leadership team has extensive experience leading and managing world-class public and private market companies in our target sectors, including News Corp. (Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal), Gannett, Bloomberg, XO Group, Yodle, Graham Holdings, The Washington Post, Liberty Interactive, C.P. Group and Moscow Exchange. The group’s experience includes initial public offerings and other public capital markets and mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”) transactions, both as operators and at financial institutions including, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, UBS and LionTree. In addition, Blue Ocean’s founders include partners of North Base Media (“NBM”), a specialty venture-capital investment firm focused on growth-stage media and technology companies in global growth markets; a senior leader and a family member from the C.P. Group of Thailand, a family-controlled conglomerate with extensive interests across Asia, including telecommunications and media; and our chief executive, who has led public and private international media and digital-marketplace businesses.\n\nWe have strong support from Apollo, which we believe will be attractive to potential target businesses. Apollo has expressed to us an interest to purchase up to an aggregate of approximately $14,985,000, or 9.99% of the units in this offering at the public offering price. Additionally, as further described herein, Apollo will only be able to purchase the maximum number of founder shares from our sponsor if they make equity investments in support of our initial business combination that total $25 million and do not redeem or sell any of their Class A ordinary shares.\n\nWe believe we have the right team, strategy and market opportunity to identity, acquire and manage a “best-in-class” asset on a global scale that will deliver attractive returns to all stakeholders. \n\nThe Blue Ocean Team\n\nMembers of the Blue Ocean management team, board of directors and advisory team have worked together and known each other for decades. Our principals have served as officers and directors of large public companies as well as cutting edge private technology companies. We have seen firsthand how traditionally offline businesses can \n\n3\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nbecome obsolete and many of us have been responsible for implementing and executing major digital transformational projects at our predecessor firms. We have significant experience identifying sustainable growth opportunities, taking companies public, integrating complex M&A transactions and rolling out global go-to-market strategies. In addition to these operating roles, our sponsor Blue Ocean Sponsor LLC (our “sponsor”) also has deep investing experience through its affiliation with NBM, a specialty venture capital firm focused on investing in early and growth stage media and technology companies, and senior leaders and family members of the C.P. Group of Thailand, which operates in a number of relevant sectors, including telecommunications and media. NBM has invested in nearly 30 companies across the world in North America, Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East and Latin America and counts among its investors leading media and technology groups in Asia, Europe and the U.S. We believe our operating and investing experience at a global scale coupled with our network of international relationships position us well to successfully effectuate Blue Ocean’s strategy. \n\nManagement Team\n\nMarcus Brauchli, Blue Ocean’s Chairman, has been co-founder and managing partner of North Base Media since January 2014. He previously was vice president of Graham Holdings Company (NYSE: GHCO) and its predecessor, The Washington Post Co., from July 2008 until December 2013, where he developed digital opportunities for a group that included The Washington Post, the Post-Newsweek television stations, the Cable One group and Slate, a digital site.

He has \n\n4\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\na degree in electrical engineering from Kettering University and an M.B.A. in Finance from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. We believe Mr. Bascobert’s extensive experience in the Internet & Digital Media Sector, as well as his substantial business, leadership and management experience, including at publicly held companies and companies seeking to go public, brings important and valuable skills to our board of directors.\n\nAnkur Manglik, Blue Ocean’s Chief Strategy Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has more than 20 years of experience in the media, communications and advertising industries across growth strategy development and execution; M&A and post-M&A integration; operational restructuring & divestitures; and equity & debt financings.

Mr. Manglik received his M.B.A. from Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management in 2004 and Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi in 1998.

You should not rely on the historical record of NBM and our management team’s performance as indicative of our future performance. See “Risk Factors — Past performance of our founders and the other members of our management team, including investments and transactions in which they have participated and businesses with which they have been associated, may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us, and we may be unable to provide positive returns to shareholders.” For a list of our executive officers, directors, advisors and entities for which a conflict of interest may or does exist between such officers, directors, advisors and the company, please refer to “Management — Conflicts of Interest.”\n\nOur Business Strategy\n\nOur business strategy is to identify and complete a business combination that can create value for shareholders over time. We believe our experience and deep network of relationships will help us identify a significant number of appealing business combination opportunities and enable us to evaluate these opportunities. Our management team has significant experience in multiple business models, across geographies and markets. Moreover, we believe that our management team’s backgrounds will make us attractive, long-term partners to business combination targets and help the post-business combination company to thrive in the public markets. \n\nBlue Ocean’s approach to sourcing and evaluating investment opportunities will draw on our management team’s experience and what we consider to be best practices for value creation. We plan to leverage our management team’s extensive experience and expertise in a methodical process to identify best-in-class initial business combination targets.\n\nExtensive international network: Our management team has experience working for some of the world’s most respected domestic and international organizations. We have developed a highly respected network of executives and investors across diverse geographies that we believe is unique to Blue Ocean. We believe that by leveraging this network we will have access to a large pool of quality targets that will be highly differentiated from those available to other SPAC. \n\nInternational investing experience: Our management team has decades of experience leading and investing in businesses in international geographies. We understand the unique nuances of various regions, particularly in Asia and Latin America. We believe this expertise will enable us to be more competitive than other SPAC sponsors in these target rich geographies. \n\nPublic company leadership experience: Our management team has significant experience in building, growing, and raising capital for large public companies. We believe this experience will enable us to identify sustainable public companies and strong leadership teams with the ability to navigate them through various environments. \n\nTrack record of value creation: Our management team has experience in both rapidly scaling earlier stage companies as well as maximizing value for more mature businesses. We also have significant turnaround experience with the ability to recognize inefficiencies and pivot to more successful business models and processes. \n\n8\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nOur Process\n\nWe intend to conduct thorough due diligence to determine a prospective target’s quality and intrinsic value. That would include reviewing financial statements, legal documents, patents and proprietary technology, and historical data. We intend to meet with members of management, consult with industry experts, clients and competitors, and seek information from analysts and others familiar with the prospective target company’s business and prospects. \n\nBusiness Combination Criteria\n\nWe intend to pursue opportunities with exceptional growth companies addressing large market opportunities in highly differentiated ways. We won’t be limited by geography—either by focusing only on the U.S. or developed markets or by exploring only large emerging markets. We intend to draw on our management team’s decades of global experience in sourcing transactions, understanding and conducting due diligence on new breakthrough technologies and leadership teams in order to identify and then negotiate a corporate combination. Our management team has experience in a number of areas related to business information and data; news products; digital video and audio platforms, including podcasting; sports and gaming media; events platforms; analytics and artificial-intelligence products for media; marketplaces and direct-to-consumer platforms. Blue Ocean ultimately intends to find a target company that defines a market, is capable of significant and sustained growth, and relies on a disruptive and highly defensible strategy.\n\nValuation: We intend to target companies whose enterprise value is between $750 million and $2.0 billion. Companies of this size offer the potential for significant long-term shareholder return.\n\nHigh growth sectors: We intend to seek companies within the consumer Internet sector and adjacent industry segments, including, but not limited to, online marketplaces, education technology, advertising technology and direct-to-consumer e-Commerce businesses. \n\nDifferentiation and scale: We intend to seek to invest in a business with a clearly differentiated market strategy and a clear vision for how it will scale the business and deploy a capital infusion effectively to accelerate growth, maintain or improve margins and outlast competition.\n\nGeography: We intend to seek opportunities globally, with a particular emphasis on large-population, high-growth emerging regions in Asia and the Americas, including the United States. \n\nLarge market opportunities: We intend to seek opportunities that have traction and the potential to scale significantly into leaders in their markets. The addressable size of the market has to justify not only the valuation at the time of our initial business combination but also leave considerable runway for future upside. We intend to prioritize companies that take a “winner takes most” or “first mover advantage” approach.\n\nGrowth: We intend to seek companies that are on a sustainable growth trajectory, benefitting from the tailwinds of global Internet adoption.\n\nManagement excellence: We intend to look for teams that are creative, ambitious, visionary and data-driven. A consistent record of growth, experience overcoming challenges, and strategic vision are essential attributes.\n\nOperational maturity: We intend to seek companies which have the requisite compliance, financial controls and reporting processes in place and are ready for the regulatory requirements of a public entity.\n\nBest-in-class technology: Proprietary technology, or skillful deployment of technology and data, is essential to long-term success. So, too, is early-to-market deployment: Speed is a competitive advantage in the use of technology and data.\n\nOpportunistic Strategy: The ability to effect business transformation and achieve growth requires an adaptable, market-tested, data-driven decision-making process and an experienced team. Where a target company’s leadership may lack this experience, Blue Ocean’s team, including its board members and advisors, can bring great depth in adaptive leadership.\n\nBenefit from being public: We intend to work with management and stakeholders who aspire to have their company become a public entity and generate substantial growth. The benefits of transitioning from a private to a public entity may include broader access to debt and equity providers, liquidity for employees and potential acquisitions, and expanded branding in the marketplace.\n\n9\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nThese criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria and guidelines in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this prospectus, would be in the form of proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we would file with the SEC.\n\nMarket Overview\n\nThe global market for entertainment and media is large and growing. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers’ (“PwC”) Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2020-2024 report, worldwide entertainment and media revenue is projected to grow from $2.0 trillion in 2020 to $2.5 trillion in 2025, representing a compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of nearly 5%. According to another PWC report on the Global Entertainment and Media Outlook 2020-2024, digital revenue as a percentage of the media sector’s total revenue prior to the COVID-19 pandemic was 56.5% and is now expected to reach 64.0% by 2024. Growth is expected to be even stronger in developing economies where countries are projected to grow at nearly twice the rate of the global market. \n\nBlue Ocean’s strategy seeks to capitalize on favorable market trends and dynamics, including:\n\n•| Shift in how data is consumed. Mobile internet subscribers grew to 3.8 billion by the end of 2019 while households using fixed broadband were projected to reach 1 billion, according to the GSMA State of Mobile Internet Connectivity Report 2020. Data usage via smartphone, which first surpassed fixed broadband in 2019, is expected to triple between 2019 and 2024 while usage via broadband is expected to only double over the same time period, according to PwC. Many new businesses are becoming entirely mobile-based.  \n---|---  \n•| Proliferation of 5G. By 2025, it is expected that 45% of the world will be covered by 5G with more than 1.7 billion connected devices according to PwC. High-speed mobile data will allow consumers to access greater quantities of content, games and services. Massive network capacity will likely lower the cost of data, reducing friction in emerging markets for applications such as gaming, entertainment, music and over-the-top (“OTT”) video.  \n---|---  \n•| Emerging-market demand. Entertainment and media revenues are growing fastest in major emerging markets, where many users are just getting access to affordable data on their phones. We believe the growth patterns established in the U.S. and China are likely to repeat in other major markets as mobile-internet penetration increases.  \n---|---  \n•| Fast growing segment. Among the fastest growing segments within the overall entertainment and media sector are expected to be virtual reality, OTT video, video games and esports, internet advertising and podcasts.   \n---|---  \n  \nWe believe that this is the right time to pursue our strategy. The stay-at-home orders and remote work and school environment created by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic accelerated digital trends that were already under way. According to the Interactive Advertising Bureau, traditional advertising is now much more focused on digital platforms and publishers. Digital subscriptions rose sharply at media companies, with the media-subscription and data company Piano reporting a 93% increase in new media subscription starts globally during April 2020. Among 123 large subscription-based sites, Piano reported that 57.8% experienced “major increases” in active subscriptions during 2020. People are spending more time at home with their smartphones and apps, according to Nielsen, and Americans spent approximately an hour more online each day in 2020 compared to 2018. E-commerce transactions in the U.S. during 2020 grew by 44%, the equivalent of the four previous years’ growth. The number of advertisers using Facebook’s platform continues to grow, with a 12% increase in the total number of ads delivered during 2020, when COVID-19 was at its worst. The top 100 advertisers on Facebook now account for only 16% of revenues, as more and more small and medium size businesses start to use the platform. Streaming entertainment proliferated, with U.S. consumers able to choose from among nearly 300 over-the-top services, according to Parks Associates. More than half of U.S. adults now pay for news, and another 26% are open to it, according to the American Press Institute. We believe global trends very much mirror those in the U.S.\n\nOther Internet-driven segments also have shown resilience or significant growth. According to venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which started a ranking of the largest consumer-facing marketplace businesses just before \n\n10\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nCOVID-19 struck, a number of categories were “supercharged,” including online education, celebrity engagement and grocery delivery. Some marketplace businesses suffered—ticketing, for instance—but that led to others that flourished, like those for live streaming events. In Asia, a new form of digital commerce spread from China to Southeast Asia, Live Commerce, in which individuals use social-media platforms to promote and sell products to their followers. Retail sales driven by live streaming on China’s “Singles Day” (November 11) in 2020 was nearly double a year earlier, according to Alibaba’s Taobao platform, and approximately 300 million viewers tapped into live-shopping channels between November 1 and 11, 2020.\n\nInitial Business Combination\n\nWe will have until 18 months from the closing of this offering to consummate an initial business combination, with an automatic three-month extension if we have signed a definitive agreement with respect to an initial business combination within such 18-month period. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 18 months, we may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by an additional three months (for a total of up to 21 months to complete a business combination) without submitting such proposed extensions to our shareholders for approval or offering our public shareholders redemption rights in connection therewith. Pursuant to the terms of our memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement to be entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on the date of this prospectus, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon ten days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account $1,500,000, or up to $1,725,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full ($0.10 per unit in either case) on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for such three-month extension. Any such payments would be made in the form of a loan. Any such loan will be non-interest bearing and payable upon the consummation of our initial business combination. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amount out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. If we do not complete our initial business combination, we will not repay such loan. Furthermore, the letter agreement with our initial shareholders contains a provision pursuant to which our sponsor has agreed to waive its right to be repaid for such loan out of the funds held in the trust account in the event that we do not complete our initial business combination. Our sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. Up to $1,500,000 of the loans made by our sponsor, our officers and directors, or their affiliates to us prior to or in connection with our initial business combination (including any loan made to extend our time period for consummating our initial business combination) may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. We will issue a press release announcing the extension at least three days prior to the applicable deadline.\n\nNasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) (which we refer to throughout this prospectus as the Nasdaq’s “80% of net assets test”) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or FINRA, or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make such independent determination of fair market value, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board of directors determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. As any such opinion, if obtained, would only state that the fair market value meets the 80% of net assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of the target or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required by Schedule 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we will file with the SEC in connection with our initial business combination will include such opinion.\n\nWe anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of \n\n11\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nthe target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act.\n\nEven if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination. To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.\n\nOur Acquisition Process\n\nWe are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination or subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, founders, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination or, subject to certain exceptions, subsequent material transactions with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor or any of our founders, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such initial business combination or transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view.\n\nMembers of our management team and our directors and advisors will directly or indirectly own our ordinary shares and/or private placement warrants following this offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.\n\nIn addition, certain of directors, director nominees and officers presently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary and contractual duties to other entities, pursuant to which such directors, director nominees and officers is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity subject to his or her fiduciary duty. As a result, if any of our directors, director nominees and officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he, she or it has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, then, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, or contractual obligations, he, she or it will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If these other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. However, we do not believe that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors, director nominees and officers will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except \n\n12\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nand to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other.\n\nFurther, our directors, director nominees and officers and any of their respective affiliates may sponsor or form, or in the case of individuals, serve as directors or officers of, other special purpose acquisition companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an initial business combination. Our directors, director nominees and officers are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.\n\nPrior to the date of this prospectus, we will file a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we will be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.\n\nCorporate Information\n\nOur executive offices are located at 2 Wisconsin Circle, 7th Floor, Chevy Chase, MD 20815, and our telephone number is (240) 235-5049. Following this offering, we will maintain a corporate website at http://www.boacquisition.com. The information that may be contained on or accessible through our corporate website or any other website that we may maintain is not part of this prospectus or the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. You should not rely on any such information in making your decision whether to invest in our securities.\n\nWe are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act. As an exempted company, we have applied for and have received, a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.\n\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.\n\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.\n\n13\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.\n\nAdditionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year or the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible. \n\n14\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nThe Offering\n\nIn making a decision whether to invest in our securities, you should take into account not only the backgrounds of the members of our management team, but also the special risks we face as a blank check company and the fact that this offering is not being conducted in compliance with Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. You will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors in Rule 419 blank check offerings. You should carefully consider these and the other risks set forth in the section of this prospectus entitled “Risk Factors.”\n\nSecurities offered\n\n15,000,000 units, at $10.00 per unit (or 17,250,000 units if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full), each unit consisting of:\n\n•| one Class A ordinary share; and  \n---|---  \n•| one-half of one redeemable warrant.  \n---|---  \n  \nProposed Nasdaq symbols\n\nUnits: “BOCNU”\n\nClass A Ordinary Shares: “BOCN”\n\nWarrants: “BOCNW”\n\nTrading commencement and separation of Class A ordinary shares and warrants\n\nThe units are expected to begin trading on or promptly after the date of this prospectus. The Class A ordinary shares and warrants comprising the units will begin separate trading on the 52nd day following the date of this prospectus (or, if such day is not a business day, on the next succeeding business day) unless Needham & Company, LLC informs us of its decision to allow earlier separate trading, subject to our having filed the Current Report on Form 8-K described below and having issued a press release announcing when such separate trading will begin. Once the Class A ordinary shares and warrants commence separate trading, holders will have the option to continue to hold units or separate their units into the component securities. Holders will need to have their brokers contact our transfer agent in order to separate the units into Class A ordinary shares and warrants. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. Accordingly, unless you purchase a multiple of two units, the number of warrants issuable to you upon separation of the units will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of warrants.\n\nAdditionally, the units will automatically separate into their component parts and will not be traded after completion of our initial business combination.\n\nSeparate trading of the Class A ordinary shares and warrants is prohibited until we have filed a Current Report on Form 8-K\n\nIn no event will the Class A ordinary shares and warrants be traded separately until we have filed with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K, which includes an audited balance sheet of the company reflecting our receipt of the gross proceeds at the closing of this offering. We will file the Current Report on Form 8-K promptly after the closing of this offering. If the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised following the initial filing of such Current Report on Form 8-K, a second or \n\n15\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\namended Current Report on Form 8-K will be filed to provide updated financial information to reflect the exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option.\n\nUnits:\n\nNumber outstanding before this offering\n\n0\n\nNumber outstanding after this offering\n\n15,000,000(1)\n\nOrdinary Shares:\n\nNumber outstanding before this offering\n\n4,312,500(2)\n\nNumber outstanding after this offering\n\n18,750,000(1)(3)\n\nWarrants:\n\nNumber of private placement warrants to be sold in a private placement simultaneously with this offering\n\n7,750,000(1)\n\nNumber of warrants to be outstanding after this offering and the sale of private placement warrants\n\n15,250,000(1)\n\nExercisability\n\nEach whole warrant sold in this offering is exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share, subject to adjustment as described herein. Only whole warrants are exercisable. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. Therefore, you must separate units in multiples of two in order to receive a whole warrant. \n\nWe structured each unit to contain one-half of one redeemable warrant, with each whole warrant exercisable for one Class A ordinary share, as compared to units issued by some other similar special purpose acquisition companies which contain whole warrants exercisable for one whole share, in order to reduce the dilutive effect of the warrants upon completion of our initial business combination as compared to units that each contain a whole warrant to purchase one whole share, thus making us, we believe, a more attractive business combination partner for target businesses. \n\nExercise price\n\n$11.50 per whole share, subject to adjustments as described herein.\n\nIn addition, if (x) we issue additional ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of our initial business combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per ordinary share (with such issue price \n\n(1)| Assumes no exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option and 562,500 founder shares are surrendered to us by our sponsor for no consideration.  \n---|---  \n  \n(2)| Consists solely of founder shares and includes up to 562,500 founder shares that will be surrendered to us by our sponsor for no consideration depending on the extent to which the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised.

If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.\n\n17\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nWe are not registering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants at this time. However, we have agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days after the closing of our initial business combination, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants. We will use our commercially reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement to become effective within 60 business days after the closing of our initial business combination, and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement provided that if our Class A ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of public warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement. If a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th business day after the closing of the initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.\n\nThe warrants will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, five years after the completion of our initial business combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. On the exercise of any warrant, the warrant exercise price will be paid directly to us and not placed in a trust account.\n\nRedemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $18.00\n\nOnce the warrants become exercisable, we may redeem the outstanding warrants (except as described herein with respect to the private placement warrants):\n\n•| in whole and not in part;  \n---|---  \n•| at a price of $0.01 per warrant;  \n---|---  \n•| upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder, which we refer to as the “30-day redemption period”; and  \n---|---  \n  \n18\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\n•| if, and only if, the last reported sale price (the “closing price”) of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under the heading “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants — Anti-Dilution Adjustments”) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe will not redeem the warrants as described above unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares is available throughout the 30-day redemption period. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem warrants even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise their warrants.\n\nExcept as set forth below, none of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by our sponsor, Apollo or their permitted transferees.\n\nRedemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00\n\nOnce the warrants become exercisable, we may redeem the outstanding warrants:\n\n•| in whole and not in part;  \n---|---  \n•| at $0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption provided that holders will be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares determined by reference to the table set forth under “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants” based on the redemption date and the “Fair Market Value” of our Class A ordinary shares (as defined below) except as otherwise described in “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants”;  \n---|---  \n•| if, and only if, the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $10.00 per public share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under   \n---|---  \n  \n19\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nthe heading “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants — Anti-dilution Adjustments”) for any 20 trading days within the 30-trading day period ending three trading days before we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders; and\n\n•| if the closing price of the Class A ordinary shares for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders is less than $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under the heading “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants — Anti-dilution Adjustments”), the private placement warrants must also be concurrently called for redemption on the same terms as the outstanding public warrants, as described above.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe “Fair Market Value” of our Class A ordinary shares for the above purpose shall mean the volume weighted average price of our Class A ordinary shares during the 10 trading days as reported immediately following the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. This redemption feature differs from the warrant redemption features used in some other blank check offerings. We will provide our warrant holders with the final Fair Market Value no later than one business day after the 10 trading-day period described above ends. In no event will the warrants be exercisable on a cashless basis in connection with this redemption feature for more than 0.361 Class A ordinary shares per warrant (subject to adjustment).\n\nNo fractional Class A ordinary shares will be issued upon redemption. If, upon redemption, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will round down to the nearest whole number of the number of Class A ordinary shares to be issued to the holder. Please see the section entitled “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants” for additional information.\n\nAbility to extend time to complete business combination\n\nWe will have until 18 months from the closing of this offering to consummate an initial business combination, with an automatic three month extension if we have signed a definitive agreement with respect to an initial business combination within such 18-month period. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 18 months, we may extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination by an \n\n20\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nadditional three months (for a total of up to 21 months to complete our initial business combination) without submitting such proposed extensions to our shareholders for approval or offering our public shareholders redemption rights in connection therewith. Pursuant to the terms of our memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement to be entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on the date of this prospectus, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon ten days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account $1,500,000, or up to $1,725,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full ($0.10 per unit in either case) on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for such three-month extension. Any such payments would be made in the form of a loan. Any such loan will be non-interest bearing and payable upon the consummation of our initial business combination. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amount out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. If we do not complete our initial business combination, we will not repay such loan. Furthermore, the letter agreement with our initial shareholders contains a provision pursuant to which our sponsor has agreed to waive its right to be repaid for such loan out of the funds held in the trust account in the event that we do not complete our initial business combination. Our sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. Up to $1,500,000 of the loans made by our sponsor, our officers and directors, or their affiliates to us prior to or in connection with our initial business combination (including any loan made to extend our time period for consummating our initial business combination) may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender.\n\nExpression of Interest\n\nApollo has expressed to us an interest to purchase an aggregate of approximately $14,985,000 or approximately 9.99%, of the units in this offering at the public offering price, and we have agreed to direct the underwriter to sell to Apollo such amount of units, subject to our satisfying the Nasdaq listing requirement that we have a minimum of 400 round lot holders of our units. Subject to Apollo purchasing at least 9.99% of the units in this offering and 100,000 private placement warrants concurrently with this offering (i) at the closing of this offering, we will issue and sell 175,000 founder shares, and (ii) at the closing of our initial business combination, we will issue and sell an additional 125,000 founder shares to Apollo less such number of shares subject to a reduction in ownership (as described below). \n\n21\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nThe purchase price for the founder shares in each case will be $0.0058 per share and our sponsor will automatically forfeit to the company for cancellation, for $0.0058 per share, a number of founder shares equal to the number of founder shares purchased by Apollo. However, if Apollo does not enter into a binding commitment to purchase an amount of Class A ordinary shares with a value of at least $25,000,000 (or equivalent securities of the target of the business combination or the successor registrant of the Company) in a private placement financing that will close concurrently with the closing of the initial business combination, the number of founder shares that Apollo will be entitled to purchase at the closing of our initial business combination will be reduced up to 125,000 founder shares on a pro rata basis. Additionally, if immediately following the closing of our initial business combination, (i) Apollo owns less than 100% but more than 50% of the 9.99% of the Class A ordinary shares sold by the company in this offering (including any shares sold by the underwriter in connection with the exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option), then Apollo will forfeit its right to purchase up to 50,000 founder shares on a pro rata basis, or (ii) Apollo owns less than 50% of the 9.99% of the Class A ordinary shares sold by the Company in this offering (including any shares sold by the underwriter in connection with the exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option), then Apollo will forfeit its right to purchase up to 75,000 founder shares in addition to the forfeiture of 50,000 founder shares pursuant to (i) on a pro rata basis. In the event our sponsor deems it necessary in order to facilitate our initial business combination for the sponsor to forfeit, transfer, exchange or amend the terms of all or any portion of the founder shares or to enter into any other arrangements with respect to the founder shares (including, without limitation, a transfer of the sponsor’s membership interests representing an interest in any of the foregoing), such change in investment will apply pro rata to Apollo and our sponsor based on the relative number of founder shares to be held by each, and, accordingly, Apollo will forfeit its right to purchase up to 125,000 founder shares as necessary to facilitate the foregoing. In the event that a reduction of ownership in Apollo’s founder shares exceeds the 125,000 additional founder shares eligible for purchase by Apollo, effective on the closing of an initial business combination, Apollo will forfeit to us, for reissuance to our sponsor, an amount of its additional founder shares previously purchased equal to such excess, provided that Apollo will not be required to forfeit more than 125,000 of the additional founder shares purchased (such that Apollo will in all circumstances be allowed to retain at least 50,000 founder shares). \n\n22\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nWe have agreed to reissue to our sponsor, at a price of $0.0058 per share, a number of founder shares equal to any founder shares or rights to purchase founder shares forfeited by Apollo.\n\nBecause these expressions of interest are not binding agreements or commitments to purchase, Apollo may determine to purchase more, fewer or no units in this offering or the underwriter may determine to sell more, fewer or no units to Apollo. In the event that Apollo does not purchase at least the amount of units for which it has expressed an interest and the warrants, as described herein, Apollo will not be entitled to purchase from our sponsor the founder shares described in this prospectus. In the event that Apollo purchases such units (either in this offering or after) and votes its public shares in favor of our initial business combination, a smaller portion of affirmative votes from other public shareholders would be required to approve our initial business combination. Apollo is required to vote its public shares in favor of our initial business combination. However, because Apollo is not obligated to continue owning any public shares following the closing, we cannot assure you that Apollo will be a shareholder at the time of our initial business combination.\n\nThere is no ceiling on the number of units that may be purchased by Apollo in this offering or on the number of our units, shares or warrants that they may purchase after this offering. However, Apollo has not indicated that it would purchase any additional units in this offering or any of our securities after the closing of this offering.\n\nAlthough we and the underwriter are not required to sell Apollo units in this offering, we expect the underwriter to sell to Apollo units up to its expression of interest, subject to our satisfying the Nasdaq listing requirement that we have a minimum of 400 round lot holders of our units. We are not aware of any circumstances (other than the Nasdaq listing requirement) under which we or the underwriter would prohibit Apollo from purchasing the applicable number of units it has expressed an interest in purchasing in this offering. In addition, the units (including the underlying public shares and warrants) Apollo may purchase in this offering will not be subject to any agreements restricting their transfer.\n\nFounder Shares\n\nOn April 7, 2021, we issued to our sponsor an aggregate of 4,312,500 founder shares in exchange for a payment of $25,000 from our sponsor to cover certain expenses on behalf of us, or approximately $0.006 per share. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by the sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The per share price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash the sponsor paid for the founder shares by the number of founder shares issued. At or prior to this offering, our sponsor \n\n23\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nwill transfer 30,000 founder shares to each of Joel Motley, Matt Goldberg, and Priscilla Han, and 25,000 founder shares to each of Norman Pearlstine and Dale Mathias, our independent director nominees at the same price originally paid for such shares. In addition, at or prior to this offering, our sponsor will transfer an aggregate of 100,000 founder shares to six advisors at the same price as originally paid for such shares. Up to 562,500 founder shares will be surrendered to us by our sponsor for no consideration after the closing of this offering depending on the extent to which the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised. The total number of Class B ordinary shares outstanding after this offering and the expiration of the underwriter’s over-allotment option will equal 20% of the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares outstanding at such time. The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder thereof, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment, as described in this prospectus. If we increase or decrease the size of this offering, we will effect a share capitalization or a share repurchase or redemption or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable, with respect to our Class B ordinary shares immediately prior to the consummation of this offering in such amount as to maintain the number of founder shares, on an as-converted basis, at 20% of the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares outstanding at such time (assuming the underwriter exercises its over-allotment option in full).\n\nThe founder shares are identical to the Class A ordinary shares included in the units being sold in this offering, except that:\n\n•| prior to our initial business combination, only holders of our Class B ordinary shares have the right to vote on the appointment of directors, including in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and holders of a majority of our Class B ordinary shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason;  \n---|---  \n•| the founder shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions contained in a letter agreement that our initial shareholders, directors and officers have entered into with us, as described in more detail below;  \n---|---  \n•| pursuant to such letter agreement, our initial shareholders, directors and officers have agreed to (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares held by them, as applicable, in   \n---|---  \n  \n24\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nconnection with the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (a) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended, as described in more detail in this prospectus) from the closing of this offering or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity and (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended, as described in more detail in this prospectus) from the closing of this offering (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame). If we submit our initial business combination to our public shareholders for a vote, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ founder shares, we would need 5,625,001, or 37.5% (assuming all outstanding shares are voted and the underwriter’s over-allotment option is not exercised) of the 15,000,000 public shares sold in this offering to be voted in favor of a transaction, in order to have such initial business combination approved. Additionally, although none of our sponsor, officers or directors have expressed any current intention to purchase our public shares in or after this offering, they are not restricted from doing so and there is no ceiling on the number of our public shares they may purchase. If they purchase any of our public shares and retain such shares until any shareholders vote on our \n\n25\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\ninitial business combination, the approval of our initial business combination by our shareholders will be even more likely. If Apollo were to purchase all units for which it has expressed an interest in purchasing in this offering (either in this offering or after) and retains the public shares comprising those units until the time of any shareholders vote on our initial business combination and votes such shares in favor of our initial business combination, we would only need 4,140,001 additional public shares, or 27.6%, to be voted in favor of our initial business combination for our initial business combination to be approved. In the event that Apollo does not purchase at least the amount of units for which it has expressed an interest and the warrants, as described herein, Apollo will not be entitled to purchase from our sponsor the founder shares described in this prospectus. In the event that Apollo purchases units (either in this offering or after) and votes its public shares in favor of our initial business combination, a smaller portion of affirmative votes from other public shareholders would be required to approve our initial business combination. As there is no ceiling on the number of units that may be purchased by Apollo in this offering or on the number of our units, shares or warrants that Apollo may purchase after this offering, the extent of Apollo’s influence on such shareholders vote may be even more significant. However, Apollo has not indicated that it would purchase any additional units in this offering or any of our securities after the closing of this offering;\n\n•| the founder shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder thereof, as described below adjacent to the caption “Founder shares conversion and anti-dilution rights”; and  \n---|---  \n•| the founder shares are entitled to registration rights.   \n---|---  \n  \nTransfer restrictions on founder shares\n\nOur initial shareholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares until the earlier to occur of: (i) one year after the completion of our initial business combination; and (ii) subsequent to our initial business combination (x) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property or (y) if the closing \n\n26\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nprice of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and other similar transactions) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination (except as described in the section entitled “Principal Shareholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants”). Any permitted transferees will be subject to the same restrictions and other agreements of our initial shareholders with respect to any founder shares. We refer to such transfer restrictions throughout this prospectus as the “lock-up.”\n\nFounder shares conversion and anti-dilution rights\n\nThe founder shares are designated as Class B ordinary shares and will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder thereof, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for share subdivisions, share dividends, rights issuances, reorganizations, recapitalizations and other similar transactions, and subject to further adjustment as provided herein. However, if additional Class A ordinary shares or any other equity-linked securities (as defined below) are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts issued in this offering and related to the closing of our initial business combination, the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all founder shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of (i) the total number of ordinary shares outstanding upon completion of this offering plus (ii) the total number of Class A ordinary shares issued, or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of the initial business combination, excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A ordinary shares issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial business combination and any private placement warrants issued to our sponsor upon conversion of working capital loans, provided that such conversion of Class B ordinary shares will never occur on a less than one-for-one basis. Any conversion of Class B ordinary shares described herein will take effect as a redemption of Class B ordinary shares and an issuance of Class A ordinary shares as a matter of Cayman Islands law. The term “equity-linked securities” refers to any debt or equity securities that are convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for our Class A ordinary shares issued in a financing transaction in connection with our initial business combination, including, but not limited to, a private placement of equity or debt securities.\n\n27\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nAppointments of directors; Voting rights\n\nHolders of record of our Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares are entitled, except as described below, to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by shareholders. Unless specified in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or as required by the Companies Act or stock exchange rules, an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company, is generally required to approve any matter voted on by our shareholders. Approval of certain actions require a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares that are voted, and pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, such actions include amending our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and approving a statutory merger or consolidation with another company. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the appointment of directors, meaning, following our initial business combination, the holders of more than 50% of our ordinary shares voted for the appointment of directors can appoint all of the directors. Only holders of Class B ordinary shares will have the right to appoint directors prior to or in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Holders of our public shares will not be entitled to vote on the appointment of directors during such time. In addition, prior to the completion of our initial business combination, holders of a majority of our Class B ordinary shares may remove a member of our board of directors for any reason. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association relating to the rights of holders of Class B ordinary shares to appoint or remove directors prior to our initial business combination may only be amended by a special resolution passed by a majority of at least 90% of our ordinary shares voting in a general meeting. With respect to any other matter submitted to a vote of our shareholders, including any vote in connection with our initial business combination, except as required by law, holders of the founder shares and holders of our public shares will vote together as a single class, with each share entitling the holder to one vote. If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will complete our initial business combination only if we receive an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. In such case, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ founder shares, we would need \n\n28\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\n5,625,001, or 37.5% (assuming all outstanding shares are voted and the underwriter’s over-allotment option is not exercised) of the 15,000,000 public shares sold in this offering to be voted in favor of a transaction, in order to have such initial business combination approved.\n\nPrivate placement warrants\n\nOur sponsor and Apollo have committed, pursuant to separate written agreements, to purchase an aggregate of 7,750,000 private placement warrants (or 8,650,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full), each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, at a price of $1.00 per warrant ($7,750,000 in the aggregate or $8,650,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full), in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of this offering. Our sponsor will purchase 7,650,000 private placement warrants (or 8,550,000 private placement warrants if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) and Apollo will purchase 100,000 private placement warrants. If we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended, as described in more detail in this prospectus) from the closing of this offering, the private placement warrants will expire worthless. The private placement warrants will be non-redeemable and exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by their initial purchasers or their permitted transferees (as described in the section entitled “Principal Shareholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants”). If the private placement warrants are held by holders other than their initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the units being sold in this offering.\n\nIn the event that our sponsor deems it necessary in order to facilitate our initial business combination for the sponsor to forfeit, transfer, exchange or amend the terms of all or any portion of the private placement warrants or to enter into any other arrangements with respect to the private placement warrants (including, without limitation, a transfer of the sponsor’s membership interests representing an interest in the private placement warrants) to facilitate the consummation of such business combination, such change shall apply pro rata to Apollo and our sponsor based on the relative number of private placement warrants held by each. By way of example, in the event 50% of the sponsor’s private placement warrants are forfeited or transferred by the sponsor as part of such business combination, Apollo shall forfeit or transfer 50% of its private placement warrants on substantially the same terms and conditions as the sponsor, in which case the reduction shall equal 50% of the private placement warrants held by Apollo at such time. \n\n29\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nTransfer restrictions on private placement warrants\n\nThe private placement warrants (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination, except as described in the section entitled “Principal Shareholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants.”\n\nCashless exercise of private placement warrants\n\nIn connection with a redemption of our warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00, holders of private placement warrants who exercise their shares on a cashless basis would receive that number of shares determined by reference to the table set forth under “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants.” If holders of private placement warrants elect to exercise them on a cashless basis at any time other than in connection with such a redemption of warrants by us, they would pay the exercise price by surrendering their warrants for that number of Class A ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of Class A ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the Sponsor Fair Market Value (defined below) over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the Sponsor Fair Market Value. The “Sponsor Fair Market Value” shall mean the average reported closing price of the Class A ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of warrant exercise is sent to the warrant agent. We expect to have policies in place that restrict insiders from selling our securities except during specific periods.\n\nProceeds to be held in trust account\n\nNasdaq rules provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust account.\n\nOf the proceeds we will receive from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants described in this prospectus, $153,000,000, or $175,950,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full ($10.20 per unit in either case), will be deposited into a segregated trust account located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and $1,622,634 will be used to pay expenses in connection with the closing of this offering and for working capital following this offering. The proceeds to be placed in the trust account include $5,250,000 (or $6,037,500 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) in deferred underwriting commissions.\n\nExcept with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our taxes, if any, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, as discussed below and subject to the requirements of law and regulation, will provide that \n\n30\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nnone of the funds held in the trust account will be released from the trust account until the earliest of (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended, as described in more detail in this prospectus) from the closing of this offering, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (a) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended, as described in more detail in this prospectus) from the closing of this offering or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could become subject to the claims of our creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of our public shareholders.\n\nAnticipated expenses and funding sources\n\nExcept as described above with respect to the payment of taxes, unless and until we complete our initial business combination, no proceeds held in the trust account will be available for our use (although such funds may be used to redeem public shares as described above). The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $153,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.1% per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. The trust account’s earnings will be lower if interest rates on short-term U.S. government treasury obligations decline. Unless and until we complete our initial business combination, we may pay our expenses only from:\n\n•| the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants not held in the trust account, which will be approximately $1,622,634 in working capital after the payment of approximately $127,366 (after giving effect to the underwriter’s reimbursement to us) in expenses relating to this offering; and  \n---|---  \n  \n31\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\n•| any loans or additional investments from our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors, although they are under no obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us, and provided any such loans will not have any claim on the proceeds held in the trust account unless such proceeds are released to us upon completion of our initial business combination.  \n---|---  \n  \nConditions to completing our initial business combination\n\nNasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make such independent determination of fair market value, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board of directors determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. As any such opinion, if obtained, would only state that the fair market value meets the 80% of net assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of the target or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required by Schedule 14A of the Exchange Act any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we will file with the SEC in connection with our initial business combination will include such opinion.\n\nWe will complete our initial business combination only if the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment \n\n32\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nCompany Act. Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test, provided that in the event that the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable.\n\nPermitted purchases of public shares and public warrants by our affiliates\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. \n\n33\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nSee “Proposed Business — Permitted Purchases and Other Transactions with Respect to Our Securities” for a description of how our sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or any of their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase securities from in any private transaction.\n\nThe purpose of any such transaction could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination, (ii) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination or (iii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such transactions with respect to our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.\n\nRedemption rights for public shareholders upon completion of our initial business combination\n\nWe will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest (net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.20 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriter. The redemption rights will include the requirement that any beneficial owner on whose behalf a redemption right is being exercised must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Further, subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we will not proceed with redeeming our public shares, even if a public shareholder has properly elected to redeem its shares, if a business combination does not close. Our initial shareholders have \n\n34\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nentered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may acquire during or after this offering in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. The other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our sponsor with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after this offering.\n\nLimitations on redemption\n\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon completion of our initial business combination (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). However, a greater net tangible asset or cash requirement may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners; (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes; or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. Furthermore, although we will not redeem shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to fall below $5,000,001 upon completion of our initial business combination, we do not have a maximum redemption threshold based on the percentage of shares sold in this offering, as many special purpose acquisition companies do. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination.\n\nManner of conducting redemptions\n\nWe will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. In the case of a general meeting, such election must be made, unless extended by us in our sole discretion, no later than two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be \n\n35\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nbased on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Under Nasdaq rules, asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval, while direct mergers with our company and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would typically require shareholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other reasons.\n\nIf we hold a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will:\n\n•| conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and  \n---|---  \n•| file proxy materials with the SEC.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we receive an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. In such case, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ founder shares, we would need 5,625,001, or 37.5% (assuming all outstanding shares are voted and the underwriter’s over-allotment option is not exercised) of the 15,000,000 public shares sold in this offering to be voted in favor of a transaction, in order to have such initial business combination approved. The other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our sponsor with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after this offering. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will require that at least 5 days’ notice will be given of any such general meeting.\n\n36\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nIf we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:\n\n•| conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and  \n---|---  \n•| file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.  \n---|---  \n  \nUpon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase our Class A ordinary shares in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.\n\nIn the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e- 1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination.\n\nLimitation on redemption rights of shareholders holding more than 15% of the Class A ordinary shares that are part of the units sold in this offering if we hold shareholder vote\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the Class A ordinary shares that are part of the units sold in this offering, without our prior consent. We believe the restriction described above will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and \n\n37\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nsubsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to redeem their shares as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the Class A ordinary shares that are part of the units sold in this offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights against a business combination if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem to no more than 15% of the Class A ordinary shares that are part of the units sold in this offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.\n\nHowever, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including all shares held by those shareholders that hold more than 15% of the Class A ordinary shares that are part of the units sold in this offering) for or against our initial business combination.\n\nRelease of funds in trust account on closing of our initial business combination.\n\nOn the completion of our initial business combination, the funds held in the trust account will be used to pay amounts due to any public shareholders who properly exercise their redemption rights as described above adjacent to the caption “Redemption rights for public shareholders upon completion of our initial business combination,” to pay the underwriter its deferred underwriting commissions, to pay all or a portion of the consideration payable to the target or owners of the target of our initial business combination and to pay other expenses associated with our initial business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or the redemption of our public shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of post-business combination businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.\n\n38\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nRedemption of public shares and distribution and liquidation if no initial business combination\n\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that we will have only 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended, as described in more detail in this prospectus) from the closing of this offering to complete our initial business combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination within such 18-month period (or within 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended), we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case, to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time period.\n\nOur initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended, as described in more detail in this prospectus) from the closing of this offering. However, if our initial shareholders or management team acquire public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the 18-month time period (or up to 21-month time period if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended).\n\nThe underwriter has agreed to waive its rights to its deferred underwriting commission held in the trust account in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to \n\n39\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\n21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the trust account that will be available to fund the redemption of our public shares.\n\nOur sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees will have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (i) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 18 months (or within up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described above adjacent to the caption “Limitations on redemptions.” For example, our board of directors may propose such an amendment if it determines that additional time is necessary to complete our initial business combination. In such event, we will conduct a proxy solicitation and distribute proxy materials pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act seeking shareholder approval of such proposal and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon shareholder approval of such amendment. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person.\n\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law.\n\nLimited payments to insiders\n\nOther than as outlined below, there will be no finder’s fees, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation paid by us to our sponsor, officers or directors, or any affiliate of our sponsor or officers, for services rendered prior to, or for \n\n40\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nany services rendered in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). The following payments will be made to our sponsor, officers or directors, or our or their affiliates, and, if made prior to our initial business combination will be made from funds held outside the trust account:\n\n•| repayment of up to an aggregate of $300,000 in loans made to us by our sponsor to cover offering-related and organizational expenses;  \n---|---  \n•| payment to an affiliate of our sponsor of up to $10,000 per month for office space, secretarial and administrative services provided to us;  \n---|---  \n•| reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating, negotiating and completing an initial business combination; and  \n---|---  \n•| repayment of loans which may be made by our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.  \n---|---  \n  \nIn the future, we, upon consultation with the compensation committee of our board of directors, may decide to compensate our executive officers and other employees.\n\nAudit committee\n\nWe will establish and maintain an audit committee, which will be composed entirely of independent directors as and when required by Nasdaq rules and Rule 10A of the Exchange Act. Among its responsibilities, the audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to our sponsor, officers or directors, or our or their affiliates and monitor compliance with the other terms relating to this offering. If any noncompliance is identified, then the audit committee will be charged with the responsibility to promptly take all action necessary to rectify such noncompliance or otherwise to cause compliance with the terms of this offering. For more information, see the section entitled “Management — Committees of the Board of Directors — Audit Committee.”\n\nConflicts of Interest\n\nEach of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary and \n\n41\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\ncontractual duties to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity subject to his or her fiduciary duties. As a result, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he, she or it has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, then, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, or contractual obligations, he, she or it will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If these other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. However, we do not believe that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our founders, officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other.\n\nIn addition, our sponsor, officers, directors and any of their respective affiliates may sponsor or form, or, in the case of individuals, serve as a director or officer of, other blank check companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an initial business combination. Our officers and directors, are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. See “Risk Factors — Certain of our officers and directors are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us, including other blank check companies, and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time and determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.”\n\n42\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nIndemnity\n\nIn order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.20 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.20 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.\n\n43\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nRisks\n\nWe are a newly incorporated company that has conducted no operations and has generated no revenues. Until we complete our initial business combination, we will have no operations and will generate no operating revenues. In making your decision whether to invest in our securities, you should take into account not only the background of our management team and the members of our Board, but also the special risks we face as a blank check company. This offering is not being conducted in compliance with Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. Accordingly, you will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors in Rule 419 blank check offerings. For additional information concerning how Rule 419 blank check offerings differ from this offering, please see the section of this prospectus entitled “Proposed Business – Comparison of This Offering to Those of Blank Check Companies Subject to Rule 419.” You should carefully consider these and the other risks set forth in the section of this prospectus entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page [[48](#tRF)] of this prospectus.\n\nSummary of Risk Factors\n\nThis summary only highlights the more detailed information appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. You should read this entire prospectus carefully, including the information under “Risk Factors” and our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus, before investing.\n\n•| We are a newly incorporated blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.  \n---|---  \n•| Our independent registered public accounting firm’s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a “going concern.”  \n---|---  \n•| Our public shareholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our shareholders do not support such a combination.  \n---|---  \n•| Your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash.  \n---|---  \n•| If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsor and members of our management team have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public shareholders vote.  \n---|---  \n•| Since Apollo may own additional founder shares, provided that we successfully complete our business combination, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate for our initial business combination.  \n---|---  \n•| The ability of our public shareholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target.  \n---|---  \n•| The ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.  \n---|---  \n•| The ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your shares.  \n---|---  \n•| The requirement that we complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) after the closing of this offering may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may limit the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, in particular as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination on terms that could produce value for our shareholders.  \n---|---  \n  \n44\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\n•| Our search for a business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the status of debt and equity markets.  \n---|---  \n•| As the number of special purpose acquisition companies evaluating targets increases, attractive targets may become scarcer and there may be more competition for attractive targets. This could increase the cost of our initial business combination and could even result in our inability to find a target or to consummate an initial business combination.  \n---|---  \n•| Changes in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial business combination.  \n---|---  \n•| We may not be able to complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) after the closing of this offering, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate.  \n---|---  \n•| If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may elect to purchase public shares or warrants, which may influence a vote on a proposed business combination and reduce the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants.  \n---|---  \n•| If a shareholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our initial business combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed.  \n---|---  \n•| You will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account, except under certain limited circumstances. Therefore, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.  \n---|---  \n•| Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.  \n---|---  \n•| You will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies.  \n---|---  \n•| Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.20 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.  \n---|---  \n•| If the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants not being held in the trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate for the 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) following the closing of this offering, it could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and our ability to complete our initial business combination, and we will depend on loans from our sponsor, its affiliates or members of our management team to fund our search and to complete our initial business combination.  \n---|---  \n•| If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.00 per public share.  \n---|---  \n•| Our key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination, and a particular business combination may be conditioned on the retention or resignation of such key personnel. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following our initial business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous.  \n---|---  \n•| We may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective target business and, as a result, may effect our initial business combination with a target business whose management may not have the skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company.  \n---|---  \n  \n45\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\n•| Our executive officers and directors will allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination.  \n---|---  \n•| Certain of our officers and directors are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us, including other blank check companies, and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time and determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.  \n---|---  \n•| We may engage in a business combination with one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors which may raise potential conflicts of interest.  \n---|---  \n•| Since our sponsor, executive officers and directors will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed (other than with respect to public shares they may acquire during or after this offering), a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination.  \n---|---  \n•| Potential participation in this offering by Apollo could reduce the public float for our shares, and could result in our inability to satisfy the Nasdaq continued listing requirements.  \n---|---  \n•| Provisions in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our Class A ordinary shares and could entrench management.  \n---|---  \n•| The warrants may become exercisable and redeemable for a security other than the Class A ordinary shares, and you will not have any information regarding such other security at this time.  \n---|---  \n•| Certain of our warrants are expected to be accounted for as a warrant liability and will be recorded at fair value upon issuance with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our ordinary shares or may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination.  \n---|---  \n•| The grant of registration rights to our initial shareholders and holders of our private placement warrants may make it more difficult to complete our initial business combination, and the future exercise of such rights may adversely affect the market price of our Class A ordinary shares.  \n---|---  \n•| Unlike some other similarly structured blank check companies, our sponsor will receive additional Class A ordinary shares if we issue shares to consummate an initial business combination.  \n---|---  \n•| We may be a passive foreign investment company, or “PFIC,” which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. investors.  \n---|---  \n•| We may reincorporate in another jurisdiction in connection with our initial business combination and such reincorporation may result in taxes imposed on shareholders or warrant holders.  \n---|---  \n•| After our initial business combination, it is possible that a majority of our directors and officers will live outside the United States and all of our assets will be located outside the United States; therefore, investors may not be able to enforce federal securities laws or their other legal rights.  \n---|---  \n•| We may issue notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial debt, to complete a business combination, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our shareholders’ investment in us.  \n---|---  \n•| Provisions in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our Class A ordinary shares and could entrench management.  \n---|---  \n•| If our management following our initial business combination is unfamiliar with United States securities laws, they may have to expend time and resources becoming familiar with such laws, which could lead to various regulatory issues.  \n---|---  \n  \n46\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\n•| After our initial business combination, substantially all of our assets may be located in a foreign country and substantially all of our revenue may be derived from our operations in any such country. Accordingly, our results of operations and prospects will be subject, to a significant extent, to the economic, political and social conditions and government policies, developments and conditions in the country in which we operate.  \n---|---  \n•| Unlike other blank check companies, we may extend the time to complete a business combination by up to three months without a shareholder vote or your ability to redeem your shares.  \n---|---  \n  \nSummary Financial Data\n\nThe following table summarizes the relevant financial data for our business and should be read with our financial statements, which are included in this prospectus. We have not had any significant operations to date, so only balance sheet data is presented.\n\n​| ​| June 30, 2021  \n---|---|---  \n​| ​| Actual| ​| ​| As Adjusted  \nBalance Sheet Data:| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nWorking capital (deficit)(1)| ​| ​| $(219,604)| ​| ​| $137,108,992  \nTotal assets(2)| ​| ​| $272,321| ​| ​| $154,636,492  \nTotal liabilities(3)| ​| ​| $258,463| ​| ​| $17,527,500  \nValue of Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption| ​| ​| $—| ​| ​| $150,000,000  \nTotal shareholders’ equity(4)| ​| ​| $13,858| ​| ​| $​(12,891,008)  \n(1)| The “as adjusted” calculation includes $153,000,000 of cash held in trust from the proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, plus $1,622,634 of cash held outside the trust account which will be available to the company to fund their working capital requirements, less $5,250,000 of deferred underwriting commissions, less $12,277,500 of warrant liabilities (assuming no exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option), plus $13,858 of actual shareholders’ equity at June 30, 2021.  \n---|---  \n(2)| The “as adjusted” calculation includes $153,000,000 of cash held in trust from the proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement units, plus $1,622,634 of cash held outside the trust account which will be available to the company to fund their working capital requirements, plus $13,858 of actual shareholders’ equity at June 30, 2021.  \n---|---  \n(3)| The “as adjusted” calculation includes $5,250,000 of deferred offering costs resulting from this offering and warrant liabilities of $12,277,500 (assuming no exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option) at June 30, 2021.  \n---|---  \n(4)| Excludes 15,000,000 Class A ordinary shares that may be redeemed in connection with our initial business combination and assuming no exercise of the over-allotment option. The “as adjusted” calculation equals the “as adjusted” total assets, less the “as adjusted” total liabilities, less the value of ordinary shares that may be converted in connection with our initial business combination ($10.00 per share).  \n---|---  \n  \nIf no business combination is completed within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering, the proceeds then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), will be used to fund the redemption of our public shares. Our sponsor, officers and directors, and Apollo have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within such 18-month (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) time period.\n\n47\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this prospectus, before making a decision to invest in our units. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\nRisks Related to our Search for, Consummation of, or Inability to Consummate, a Business Combination and Post-Business Combination Risks\n\nWe are a newly incorporated blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.\n\nWe are a newly incorporated blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company with no operating results, and we will not commence operations until obtaining funding through this offering. Because we lack an operating history, you have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective of completing our initial business combination. We have no plans, arrangements or understandings with any prospective target business concerning a business combination and may be unable to complete our initial business combination. If we fail to complete our initial business combination, we will never generate any operating revenues.\n\nOur independent registered public accounting firm’s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a “going concern.”\n\nAs of June 30, 2021, we had $38,858 in cash and working capital deficit of $219,604. Further we expect to incur significant costs in pursuit of our initial business combination. Management’s plans to address this need for capital through this offering are discussed in the section of this prospectus titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Our plans to raise capital and to consummate our initial business combination may not be successful. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements contained elsewhere in this prospectus do not include any adjustments that might result from our inability to consummate this offering or our inability to continue as a going concern.\n\nOur public shareholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our shareholders do not support such a combination.\n\nWe may choose not to hold a shareholder vote before we complete our initial business combination if the business combination would not require shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. For instance, if we were seeking to acquire a target business where the consideration we were paying in the transaction was all cash, we would typically not be required to seek shareholder approval to complete such a transaction. Except for as required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, the decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors, such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. Accordingly, we may complete our initial business combination even if holders of a majority of our outstanding ordinary shares do not approve of the business combination we complete. Please see the section entitled “Proposed Business — Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination” for additional information.\n\nYour only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash.\n\nAt the time of your investment in us, you will not be provided with an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of our initial business combination. Since our board of directors may complete a business combination without seeking shareholder approval, public shareholders may not have the right or opportunity to vote on the business combination, unless we seek such shareholder vote. Accordingly, your only opportunity to affect the \n\n48\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\ninvestment decision regarding our initial business combination may be limited to exercising your redemption rights within the period of time (which will be at least 20 business days) set forth in our tender offer documents mailed to our public shareholders in which we describe our initial business combination.\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our initial shareholders and management team have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public shareholders vote.\n\nOur initial shareholders will own 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares immediately following the completion of this offering (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering). Our initial shareholders and management team also may from time to time purchase Class A ordinary shares prior to our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that, if we seek shareholder approval of an initial business combination, such initial business combination will be approved only if we receive an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company, including the founder shares. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ founder shares, we would need 5,625,001, or 37.5% (assuming all outstanding shares are voted and the underwriter’s over-allotment option is not exercised) of the 15,000,000 public shares sold in this offering to be voted in favor of a transaction, in order to have such initial business combination approved. Additionally, although none of our sponsor, officers or directors have expressed any current intention to purchase our public shares in or after this offering, they are not restricted from doing so and there is no ceiling on the number of our public shares they may purchase. If they purchase any of our public shares and retain such shares until any shareholders vote on our initial business combination, the approval of our initial business combination by our shareholders will be even more likely. If Apollo were to purchase all units for which it has expressed an interest (either in this offering or after) and retains the public shares comprising those units until the time of any shareholders vote on our initial business combination and votes such shares in favor of our initial business combination, we would only need 4,140,001 additional public shares, or 27.6%, to be voted in favor of our initial business combination for our initial business combination to be approved. In the event that Apollo purchases units (either in this offering or after) and votes its public shares in favor of our initial business combination, a smaller portion of affirmative votes from other public shareholders would be required to approve our initial business combination. As there is no ceiling on the number of units that may be purchased by Apollo in this offering or on the number of our units, shares or warrants that Apollo may purchase after this offering, the extent of Apollo’s influence on such shareholders vote may be even more significant. However, Apollo has not indicated that it would purchase any additional units in this offering or any of our securities after the closing of this offering. Accordingly, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, the agreement by our initial shareholders and management team to vote in favor of our initial business combination and if Apollo votes its Public Shares in favor of a business combination, it will increase the likelihood that we will receive the requisite shareholder approval for such initial business combination.\n\nSince Apollo may own additional founder shares, provided that we successfully complete a business combination, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate for our initial business combination.\n\nApollo may own founder shares and, as such, may share in any appreciation of the founder shares, provided that we successfully complete our initial business combination. Accordingly, the possibility of owning founder shares upon completion of our initial business combination may provide them with an incentive to vote any public shares they own in favor of a business combination, and make a substantial profit on such interests, even if the business combination is with a target that ultimately declines in value and is not profitable for other public shareholders.\n\nThe ability of our public shareholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target.\n\nWe may seek to enter into a business combination transaction agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the business combination. Furthermore, in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon completion of our initial business combination (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon \n\n49\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\ncompletion of our initial business combination or such greater amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition as described above, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate business combination. Prospective targets will be aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into a business combination transaction with us.\n\nThe ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.\n\nAt the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business combination, we will not know how many shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, and therefore will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the trust account to meet such requirements, or arrange for third party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares are submitted for redemption than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account or arrange for third party financing. Raising additional third-party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. In addition, the amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriter will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with an initial business combination. The per-share amount we will distribute to shareholders who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commission and after such redemptions, the amount held in trust will continue to reflect our obligation to pay the entire deferred underwriting commissions. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business combination available to us or optimize our capital structure.\n\nThe ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your shares.\n\nIf our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful is increased. If our initial business combination is unsuccessful, you would not receive your pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account until we liquidate the trust account. If you are in need of immediate liquidity, you could attempt to sell your shares in the open market; however, at such time our shares may trade at a discount to the pro rata amount per share in the trust account. In either situation, you may suffer a material loss on your investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with our redemption until we liquidate or you are able to sell your shares in the open market.\n\nThe requirement that we complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) after the closing of this offering may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may limit the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, in particular as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination on terms that would produce value for our shareholders.\n\nAny potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning a business combination will be aware that we must complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering. Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination, knowing that if we do not complete our initial business combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination with any target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the time frame described above. In addition, we may have limited time to conduct due diligence and may enter into our initial business combination on terms that we would have rejected upon a more comprehensive investigation.\n\nOur search for a business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and other events, and the status of debt and equity markets.\n\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has and is continuing to spread throughout China and other parts of the world, including the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a “Public Health \n\n50\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nEmergency of International Concern.” On January 31, 2020, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency for the United States to aid the U.S. healthcare community in responding to COVID-19, and on March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak as a “pandemic.” The COVID-19 pandemic and other events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases) could adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide, and the business of any potential target business with which we consummate a business combination could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, we may be unable to complete a business combination if continued concerns relating to COVID-19 continue to restrict travel, limit the ability to have meetings with potential investors or the target company’s personnel, vendors and services providers are unavailable to negotiate and consummate a transaction in a timely manner. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for a business combination will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 or other events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases) continue for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate a business combination, or the operations of a target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, our ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by COVID-19 and other events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases), including as a result of increased market volatility, decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all.\n\nFinally, the COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, such as those related to the market for our securities and cross-border transactions.\n\nAs the number of special purpose acquisition companies evaluating targets increases, attractive targets may become scarcer and there may be more competition for attractive targets. This could increase the cost of our initial business combination and could even result in our inability to find a target or to consummate an initial business combination.\n\nIn recent years, the number of special purpose acquisition companies that have been formed has increased substantially. Many potential targets for special purpose acquisition companies have already entered into an initial business combination, and there are still many special purpose acquisition companies seeking targets for their initial business combination, as well as many such companies currently in registration. As a result, at times, fewer attractive targets may be available, and it may require more time, more effort and more resources to identify a suitable target and to consummate an initial business combination.\n\nIn addition, because there are more special purpose acquisition companies seeking to enter into an initial business combination with available targets, the competition for available targets with attractive fundamentals or business models may increase, which could cause targets companies to demand improved financial terms. Attractive deals could also become scarcer for other reasons, such as economic or industry sector downturns, geopolitical tensions, or increases in the cost of additional capital needed to close business combinations or operate targets post-business combination. This could increase the cost of, delay or otherwise complicate or frustrate our ability to find and consummate an initial business combination, and may result in our inability to consummate an initial business combination on terms favorable to our investors altogether.\n\nChanges in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial business combination.\n\nIn recent months, the market for directors and officers liability insurance for special purpose acquisition companies has changed. Fewer insurance companies are offering quotes for directors and officers liability coverage, the premiums charged for such policies have generally increased and the terms of such policies have generally become less favorable. There can be no assurance that these trends will not continue.\n\nThe increased cost and decreased availability of directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate an initial business combination. In order to obtain directors and officers liability insurance or modify its coverage as a result of becoming a public company, the post-business combination entity might need to incur greater expense, accept less favorable terms or both. However, any failure to obtain adequate directors and officers liability insurance could have an adverse impact on the post-business combination’s ability to attract and retain qualified officers and directors.\n\n51\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nIn addition, even after we were to complete an initial business combination, our directors and officers could still be subject to potential liability from claims arising from conduct alleged to have occurred prior to the initial business combination. As a result, in order to protect our directors and officers, the post-business combination entity may need to purchase additional insurance with respect to any such claims (“run-off insurance”). The need for run-off insurance would be an added expense for the post-business combination entity, and could interfere with or frustrate our ability to consummate an initial business combination on terms favorable to our investors.\n\nWe may not be able to complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) after the closing of this offering, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate.\n\nWe may not be able to find a suitable target business and complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) after the closing of this offering. Our ability to complete our initial business combination may be negatively impacted by general market conditions, volatility in the capital and debt markets and the other risks described herein. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the U.S. and global economies and, while the extent of the impact of the outbreak on us will depend on future developments, it could limit our ability to complete our initial business combination, including as a result of increased market volatility, decreased market liquidity and third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all. Additionally, the outbreak of COVID-19 and other events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases) may negatively impact businesses we may seek to acquire. If we have not completed our initial business combination within such time period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case, to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law. In either such case, our public shareholders may receive only $10.20 per public share, or less than $10.20 per public share, on the redemption of their shares, and our warrants will expire worthless. See “— If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.20 per public share” and other risk factors herein.\n\nUnlike other blank check companies, we may extend the time to complete a business combination by up to three months without a shareholder vote or your ability to redeem your shares.\n\nWe will have until 18 months from the closing of this offering to consummate an initial business combination, with an automatic three-month extension if we have signed a definitive agreement with respect to an initial business combination within such 18-month period. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 18 months, we may extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination by an additional three months (for a total of 21 months to complete a business combination) without submitting such proposed extensions to our shareholders for approval or offering our public shareholders redemption rights in connection therewith. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and subject to deposit of additional funds by our sponsor or its affiliates or designees into our trust account as set forth thereunder, we may effectuate such extensions without submitting such proposed extensions to our shareholders for approval or offering our public shareholders redemption rights in connection with the proposed extensions.\n\n52\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may elect to purchase public shares or public warrants, which may influence a vote on a proposed business combination and reduce the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants.\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. Any such price per share may be different than the amount per share a public shareholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial business combination. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates, are under no obligation to do so and they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or public warrants in such transactions.\n\nIn the event that our sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination, (ii) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination or (iii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. Any such purchase will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent the purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. See “Proposed Business — Permitted Purchases and Other Transactions with Respect to Our Securities” for a description of how our sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or any of their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase securities from in any private transaction.\n\nIn addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.\n\nIf a shareholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our initial business combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed.\n\nWe will comply with the proxy rules or tender offer rules, as applicable, when conducting redemptions in connection with our initial business combination. Despite our compliance with these rules, if a shareholder fails to receive our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, such shareholder may not become aware of the opportunity to redeem its shares. In addition, the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will describe the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly redeem or tender public shares. In the event that a shareholder fails to comply with these procedures, its shares may not be redeemed. See “Proposed Business — Tendering Share Certificates in Connection With a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights.”\n\nYou will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account, except under certain limited circumstances. Therefore, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.\n\nOur public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business combination, and then only in connection with those Class A ordinary shares that such shareholders properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described herein, (ii) the \n\n53\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nredemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (a) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete an initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further described herein. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind in the trust account. Holders of warrants will not have any right to the proceeds held in the trust account with respect to the warrants. Accordingly, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.\n\nNasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\n\nWe have applied to have our units listed on Nasdaq on or promptly after the date of this prospectus and our Class A ordinary shares and warrants on or promptly after their date of separation. We cannot guarantee that our securities will be approved for listing on Nasdaq. Although after giving effect to this offering we expect to meet, on a pro forma basis, the minimum initial listing standards set forth in the Nasdaq listing standards, we cannot assure you that our securities will be, or will continue to be, listed on Nasdaq in the future or prior to our initial business combination. In order to continue listing our securities on Nasdaq prior to our initial business combination, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and share price levels. Generally, based on Nasdaq’s current listing standards, we must maintain a minimum market value of listed securities of $75,000,000 and a minimum of 400 holders of our listed securities. Additionally, our units will not be traded after completion of our initial business combination, and, in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with Nasdaq’s initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements, in order to continue to maintain the listing of our securities on Nasdaq. For instance, based on Nasdaq’s current listing standards, our share price would be required to be at least $4.00 per share, the market value of listed securities would be required to be at least $75 million (or we would need to satisfy certain shareholders’ equity or total assets and total revenue requirements) and we would be required to have a minimum of 400 round lot holders (with at least 50% of such round lot holders holding securities with a market value of at least $2,500) of our securities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time.\n\nIf Nasdaq delists any of our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect such securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\n•| a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;  \n---|---  \n•| reduced liquidity for our securities;  \n---|---  \n•| a determination that our Class A ordinary shares are a “penny stock” which will require brokers trading in our Class A ordinary shares to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;  \n---|---  \n•| a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and  \n---|---  \n•| a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as “covered securities.” Because we expect that our units and eventually our Class A ordinary shares and warrants will be listed on Nasdaq, our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants will qualify as covered securities under the statute. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of covered securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, other than the State of Idaho, certain state securities \n\n54\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nregulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on Nasdaq, our securities would not qualify as covered securities under the statute and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\n\nYou will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies.\n\nSince the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants are intended to be used to complete an initial business combination with a target business that has not been selected, we may be deemed to be a “blank check” company under the United States securities laws. However, because we will have net tangible assets in excess of $5,000,000 upon the completion of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants and will file a Current Report on Form 8-K, including an audited balance sheet of the company demonstrating this fact, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors in blank check companies, such as Rule 419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules. Among other things, this means our units will be immediately tradable and we will have a longer period of time to complete our initial business combination than do companies subject to Rule 419. Moreover, if this offering were subject to Rule 419, that rule would prohibit the release of any interest earned on funds held in the trust account to us unless and until the funds in the trust account were released to us in connection with our completion of an initial business combination. For a more detailed comparison of our offering to offerings that comply with Rule 419, please see “Proposed Business — Comparison of This Offering to Those of Blank Check Companies Subject to Rule 419.”\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, and if you or a “group” of shareholders are deemed to hold in excess of 15% of our Class A ordinary shares, you will lose the ability to redeem all such shares in excess of 15% of our Class A ordinary shares.\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the Class A ordinary shares that are part of the units sold in this offering, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares,” without our prior consent. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Your inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce your influence over our ability to complete our initial business combination and you could suffer a material loss on your investment in us if you sell Excess Shares in open market transactions. Additionally, you will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if we complete our initial business combination. And as a result, you will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding 15% and, in order to dispose of such shares, would be required to sell your shares in open market transactions, potentially at a loss.\n\nBecause of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.20 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.\n\nWe expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other special purpose acquisition companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries.\n\nMany of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. \n\n55\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nFurthermore, we are obligated to offer holders of our public shares the right to redeem their shares for cash at the time of our initial business combination in conjunction with a shareholder vote or via a tender offer. Target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination.\n\nIf we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.20 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. See “— If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.20 per public share” and other risk factors herein.\n\nIf the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants not being held in the trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate for at least the 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) following the closing of this offering, it could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination, and we will depend on loans from our sponsor or management team to fund our search and to complete our initial business combination.\n\nOf the net proceeds of this offering, only an estimated $1,622,634 will be available to us initially outside the trust account to fund our working capital requirements. We believe that, upon closing of this offering, the funds available to us outside of the trust account will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) following the closing of this offering; however, we cannot assure you that our estimate is accurate. Of the funds available to us, we could use a portion of the funds available to us to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business. We could also use a portion of the funds as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses from “shopping” around for transactions with other companies or investors on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business and were subsequently required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise), we might not have sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, a target business.\n\nIn the event that our offering expenses (after giving effect to the underwriter’s reimbursement to us) exceed our estimate of $127,366, we may fund such excess with funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $127,366, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount. The amount held in the trust account will not be impacted as a result of such increase or decrease. If we are required to seek additional capital, we would need to borrow funds from our sponsor, management team or other third parties to operate or may be forced to liquidate. Neither our sponsor, members of our management team nor any of their affiliates is under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us. Any such advances may be repaid only from funds held outside the trust account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial business combination.\n\nUp to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. If we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. Consequently, our public shareholders may only receive an estimated $10.20 per public share, or possibly less, on our redemption of our public shares, and our warrants will expire worthless. See “— If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.20 per public share” and other risk factors herein.\n\n56\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nSubsequent to our completion of our initial business combination, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges or file for bankruptcy protection, which could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our securities, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\n\nEven if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business with which we combine, we cannot assure you that this diligence will identify all material issues with a particular target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges or file for bankruptcy protection, which could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining post-combination debt financing. Accordingly, any shareholders or warrant holders who choose to remain shareholders or warrant holders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such shareholders and warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.\n\nIf third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.20 per public share.\n\nOur placing of funds in the trust account may not protect those funds from third-party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (except our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements, they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will consider whether competitive alternatives are reasonably available to the company, and will only enter into an agreement with such third party if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be in the best interests of the company under the circumstances. The underwriter of this offering will not execute an agreement with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account.\n\nExamples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason.\n\nUpon redemption of our public shares, if we do not complete our initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders could be less than the $10.20 per public share initially held in the trust account, due to claims of such creditors. Pursuant to the letter agreement the form of which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, our sponsor has agreed that they will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.20 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.20 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account \n\n57\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\n(whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.20 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.\n\nOur independent directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public shareholders.\n\nIn the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.20 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.20 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary duties may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public shareholders may be reduced below $10.20 per public share.\n\nIf, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy or insolvency court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims of punitive damages.\n\nIf, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy and/or insolvency laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages.\n\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our shareholders and the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our shareholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.\n\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our shareholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.\n\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we will be required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, \n\n58\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\napplicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations.\n\nWe may not hold an annual general meeting until after the consummation of our initial business combination. Our public shareholders will not have the right to appoint directors until after the consummation of our initial business combination.\n\nIn accordance with Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual general meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on Nasdaq. There is no requirement under the Companies Act for us to hold annual or extraordinary general meetings to appoint directors. Until we hold an annual general meeting, public shareholders may not be afforded the opportunity to discuss company affairs with management. Our board of directors is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being appointed in each year and each class (except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual general meeting) serving a three-year term. In addition, as holders of our Class A ordinary shares, our public shareholders will not have the right to vote on the appointment of directors until after the consummation of our initial business combination. In addition, prior to our initial business combination, only holders of our Class B ordinary shares have the right to vote on the appointment of directors, including in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and holders of a majority of our Class B ordinary shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason. Accordingly, you may not have any say in the management of our company prior to the consummation of an initial business combination.\n\nAlthough we have identified general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, we may enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet such criteria and guidelines, and as a result, the target business with which we enter into our initial business combination may not have attributes entirely consistent with our general criteria and guidelines.\n\nAlthough we have identified general criteria and guidelines for evaluating prospective target businesses, it is possible that a target business with which we enter into our initial business combination will not meet some or all of these criteria and guidelines. If we complete our initial business combination with a target that does not meet some or all of these criteria and guidelines, such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a business that does meet all of our general criteria and guidelines. In addition, if we announce a prospective business combination with a target that does not meet our general criteria and guidelines, a greater number of shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, which may make it difficult for us to meet any closing condition with a target business that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. In addition, if shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, it may be more difficult for us to attain shareholder approval of our initial business combination if the target business does not meet our general criteria and guidelines. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.20 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.\n\nWe are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent accounting or investment banking firm, and consequently, you may have no assurance from an independent source that the price we are paying for the business is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view.\n\nUnless we complete our initial business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such initial business combination or transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view. If no opinion is obtained, our shareholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will determine fair market value based on standards generally accepted by the financial community. Such standards used will be disclosed in our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, related to our initial business combination.\n\n59\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nOur ability to successfully effect our initial business combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following our initial business combination. In addition, the officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of our initial business combination. The loss of a business combination target’s key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business.\n\nOur ability to successfully effect our initial business combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. The role of our key personnel in the target business, however, cannot presently be ascertained. Although some of our key personnel may remain with the target business in senior management, director or advisory positions following our initial business combination, it is likely that some or all of the management of the target business will remain in place. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after our initial business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a company regulated by the SEC, which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements.\n\nIn addition, the directors and officers of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of our initial business combination. The departure of a business combination target’s key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. The role of an acquisition candidate’s key personnel upon the completion of our initial business combination cannot be ascertained at this time. Although we contemplate that certain members of an acquisition candidate’s management team will remain associated with the acquisition candidate following our initial business combination, it is possible that members of the management of an acquisition candidate will not wish to remain in place. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business.\n\nOur key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination, and a particular business combination may be conditioned on the retention or resignation of such key personnel. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following our initial business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous.\n\nOur key personnel may be able to remain with our company after the completion of our initial business combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to us after the completion of the business combination. Such negotiations also could make such key personnel’s retention or resignation a condition to any such agreement. The personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. However, we believe the ability of such individuals to remain with us after the completion of our initial business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. There is no certainty, however, that any of our key personnel will remain with us after the completion of our initial business combination. We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with us. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with us will be made at the time of our initial business combination.\n\nWe may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective target business and, as a result, may effect our initial business combination with a target business whose management may not have the skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company.\n\nWhen evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target business’s management may be limited due to a lack of time, resources or information. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target business’s management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we suspected. Should the target business’s management not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company, the operations and profitability of the post-combination business may be negatively impacted. Accordingly, any shareholders or warrant holders who choose to remain shareholders or warrant holders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such shareholders and warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.\n\n60\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nCertain of our officers and directors have or will have direct and indirect economic interests in us and/or our sponsor after the consummation of this offering and such interests may potentially conflict with those of our public shareholders as we evaluate and decide whether to recommend a potential business combination to our public shareholders.\n\nCertain of our officers and directors may own membership interests in our sponsor and indirect interests in our Class B ordinary shares and private placement warrants which may result in interests that differ from the economic interests of the investors in this offering, which includes making a determination of whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. There may be a potential conflict of interest between our officers and directors that hold membership interests in our sponsor and our public shareholders that may not be resolved in favor of our public shareholders. See “Management — Conflicts of Interest.”\n\nOur executive officers and directors will allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination.\n\nOur executive officers and directors are not required to, and will not, commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our search for a business combination and their other businesses. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Each of our executive officers is engaged in several other business endeavors for which he may be entitled to substantial compensation, and our executive officers are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours per week to our affairs. Our independent directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities. If our executive officers’ and directors’ other business affairs require them to devote substantial amounts of time to such affairs in excess of their current commitment levels, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs which may have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination. For a complete discussion of our executive officers’ and directors’ other business affairs, please see “Management — Officers, Directors and Director Nominees.”\n\nCertain of our officers and directors are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us, including other blank check companies, and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time and determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.\n\nFollowing the completion of this offering and until we consummate our initial business combination, we intend to engage in the business of identifying and combining with one or more businesses. Our sponsor and officers and directors are, and may in the future become, affiliated with entities that are engaged in a similar business. In addition, our sponsor, officers and directors may participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company prior to completion of our initial business combination. As a result, our sponsor, officers or directors could have conflicts of interest in determining whether to present business combination opportunities to us or to any other blank check company with which they may become involved. However, we do not believe that any potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.\n\nOur officers and directors also may become aware of business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us and the other entities to which they owe certain fiduciary or contractual duties.\n\nAccordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other.\n\nFor a complete discussion of our officers’ and directors’ business affiliations and the potential conflicts of interest that you should be aware of, please see the sections of this prospectus entitled “Management — Officers, Directors and Director Nominees,” “Management — Conflicts of Interest” and “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”\n\n61\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nWe may engage in a business combination with one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors which may raise potential conflicts of interest.\n\nIn light of the involvement of our sponsor, executive officers and directors with other entities, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors. Our directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities, including, without limitation, those described under “Management — Conflicts of Interest.” In addition, our sponsor and our officers and directors may sponsor or form other special purpose acquisition companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an initial business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target. However, we do not believe that any potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Such entities may compete with us for business combination opportunities. Our sponsor, officers and directors are not currently aware of any specific opportunities for us to complete our initial business combination with any entities with which they are affiliated, and there have been no substantive discussions concerning a business combination with any such entity or entities. Despite our agreement to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm regarding the fairness to our company from a financial point of view of a business combination with one or more domestic or international businesses affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, potential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the business combination may not be as advantageous to our public shareholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest.\n\nSince our sponsor, executive officers and directors will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed (other than with respect to public shares they may acquire during or after this offering), a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination.\n\nOur initial shareholders currently own an aggregate of 4,312,500 Class B ordinary shares (up to 562,500 of which will be surrendered to us by our sponsor for no consideration after the closing of this offering depending on the extent to which the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised). If we increase or decrease the size of this offering, we will effect a share capitalization or a share repurchase or redemption or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable, with respect to our Class B ordinary shares immediately prior to the consummation of this offering in such amount as to maintain the number of founder shares, on an as-converted basis, at 20% of the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares outstanding at such time (assuming the underwriter exercises its over-allotment option in full). The founder shares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination. In addition, our sponsor and Apollo have committed, pursuant to separate written agreements, to purchase an aggregate of 7,750,000 private placement warrants (or 8,650,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full), each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, at a price of $1.00 per warrant ($7,750,000 in the aggregate or $8,650,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full), in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of this offering. Our sponsor will purchase 7,650,000 private placement warrants (or 8,550,000 private placement warrants if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) and Apollo will purchase 100,000 private placement warrants. If we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering, the private placement warrants will expire worthless. In the event that our sponsor deems it necessary in order to facilitate our initial business combination for the sponsor to forfeit, transfer, exchange or amend the terms of all or any portion of the private placement warrants or to enter into any other arrangements with respect to the private placement warrants (including, without limitation, a transfer of the sponsor’s membership interests representing an interest in the private placement warrants) to facilitate the consummation of such business combination, such change shall apply pro rata to Apollo and our sponsor based on the relative number of private placement warrants held by each. By way of example, in the event 50% of the sponsor’s private placement warrants are forfeited or transferred by the sponsor as part of such business combination, Apollo shall forfeit or transfer 50% of its private placement warrants on substantially the same terms and conditions as the sponsor, in which case the reduction shall equal 50% of the private placement warrants held by Apollo at such time. The personal and financial interests of our executive officers and directors may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business combination, completing an initial business combination and influencing the operation of the business following the initial business combination. This risk may become more acute as the deadline for completing of an initial business combination nears.\n\n62\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nConcentration of ownership among our sponsor and Apollo may prevent other investors from influencing significant corporate decisions or adversely affect the trading price of our public shares.\n\nThere can be no assurance that Apollo will acquire any units in this offering, or, if acquired, as to the number of such units Apollo will retain, if any, prior to or upon the consummation of our initial business combination. If Apollo purchases the full amounts described in “Principal Shareholders,” our sponsor and Apollo will own collectively 27.99% of our outstanding ordinary shares assuming no exercise of the underwriter’s option to purchase additional units. As a result, our sponsor and Apollo could exercise significant influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval. This potential concentration of influence could be disadvantageous to other shareholders with interests different from those of our sponsor or Apollo. In addition, this potential significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our public shares because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with principal shareholders. Furthermore, the units (including the underlying public shares and warrants) Apollo may purchase in this offering will not be subject to any agreements restricting their transfer, and therefore sales of such securities on the open market may adversely affect the prevailing market prices for our units, Class A Ordinary Shares or warrants, as applicable.\n\nWe may only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which may have a limited number of products or services. This lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations and profitability.\n\nThe net proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants will provide us with $157,750,000 (or $181,150,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) that we may use to complete our initial business combination (which includes $5,250,000 or up to $6,037,500 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full, of deferred underwriting commissions being held in the trust account, and excludes estimated offering expenses of $127,366, after giving effect to the underwriter’s reimbursement to us).\n\nWe may effectuate our initial business combination with a single-target business or multiple-target businesses simultaneously or within a short period of time. However, we may not be able to effectuate our initial business combination with more than one target business because of various factors, including the existence of complex accounting issues and the requirement that we prepare and file pro forma financial statements with the SEC that present operating results and the financial condition of several target businesses as if they had been operated on a combined basis. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be:\n\n•| solely dependent upon the performance of a single business, property or asset; or  \n---|---  \n•| dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.  \n---|---  \n  \nThis lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial business combination.\n\nWe may attempt to simultaneously complete business combinations with multiple prospective targets, which may hinder our ability to complete our initial business combination and give rise to increased costs and risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability.\n\nIf we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses that are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete our initial business combination. With multiple business combinations, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business. If we are unable to adequately address these risks, it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations.\n\n63\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nWe may attempt to complete our initial business combination with a private company about which little information is available, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all.\n\nIn pursuing our business combination strategy, we may seek to effectuate our initial business combination with a privately held company. Very little public information generally exists about private companies, and we could be required to make our decision on whether to pursue a potential initial business combination on the basis of limited information, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all.\n\nOur management may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management will possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business.\n\nWe may structure our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-business combination company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new Class A ordinary shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new Class A ordinary shares, our shareholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding Class A ordinary shares subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority shareholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company’s shares than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain our control of the target business.\n\nWe do not have a specified maximum redemption threshold. The absence of such a redemption threshold may make it possible for us to complete our initial business combination with which a substantial majority of our shareholders do not agree.\n\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will not provide a specified maximum redemption threshold, except that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon completion of our initial business combination (such that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). As a result, we may be able to complete our initial business combination even though a substantial majority of our public shareholders do not agree with the transaction and have redeemed their shares or, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, have entered into privately negotiated agreements to sell their shares to our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination.\n\nThe provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that relate to our pre-business combination activity (and corresponding provisions of the agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account) may be amended with the approval of holders of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company (or 65% of our ordinary shares with respect to amendments to the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account), which is a lower amendment threshold than that of some other special purpose acquisition companies. It may be easier for us, therefore, to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to facilitate the completion of an initial business combination that some of our shareholders may not support.\n\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that any of its provisions related to pre-business combination activity (including the requirement to deposit proceeds of this offering and the private \n\n64\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nplacement of warrants into the trust account and not release such amounts except in specified circumstances, and to provide redemption rights to public shareholders as described herein) may be amended if approved by special resolution, meaning holders of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company, and corresponding provisions of the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account may be amended if approved by holders of not less than 65% of our ordinary shares; provided that the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association relating to the rights of holders of Class B ordinary shares to appoint or remove directors prior to our initial business combination may only be amended by a special resolution passed by a majority of at least 90% our ordinary shares voting in a general meeting. Our initial shareholders, who will collectively beneficially own 20.00% of our ordinary shares upon the closing of this offering (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering), will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and/or trust agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. As a result, we may be able to amend the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association which govern our pre-business combination behavior more easily than some other special purpose acquisition companies, and this may increase our ability to complete a business combination with which you do not agree. Our shareholders may pursue remedies against us for any breach of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association.\n\nOur sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees have agreed, pursuant to agreements with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (i) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial combination activity, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. Our shareholders are not parties to, or third-party beneficiaries of, these agreements and, as a result, will not have the ability to pursue remedies against our sponsor, executive officers, directors or director nominees for any breach of these agreements. As a result, in the event of a breach, our shareholders would need to pursue a shareholder derivative action, subject to applicable law.\n\nA provision of our warrant agreement may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination.\n\nUnlike some blank check companies, if:\n\n(i)| we issue additional ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of our initial business combination at a Newly Issued Price of less than $9.20 per ordinary share;  \n---|---  \n(ii)| the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our initial business combination on the date of the completion of our initial business combination (net of redemptions); and  \n---|---  \n(iii)| the Market Value is below $9.20 per share,  \n---|---  \n  \nthen the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, the $10.00 per share redemption trigger price described below under “Description of Securities – Warrants – Public Shareholders’ Warrants – Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00” will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the $18.00 per share redemption trigger price described below under “Description of Securities – Warrants – Public Shareholders’ Warrants – Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $18.00” and “Description of Securities – Warrants – Public Shareholders’ Warrants – Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00” will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price. This may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination with a target business.\n\n65\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nBecause we must furnish our shareholders with target business financial statements, we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial business combination with some prospective target businesses.\n\nThe federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historical and/or pro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with our tender offer documents, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America or GAAP, or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame.\n\nTransactions in connection with or in anticipation of our initial business combination and our structure thereafter may not be tax-efficient to our shareholders and warrant-holders. As a result of our business combination, our tax obligations may be more complex, burdensome and uncertain.\n\nAlthough we will attempt to structure transactions in connection with our initial business combination in a tax-efficient manner, tax structuring considerations are complex, the relevant facts and law are uncertain and may change, and we may prioritize commercial and other considerations over tax considerations. For example, in anticipation of or as a result of our initial business combination and subject to requisite shareholder approval, we may enter into one or more transactions that require shareholders and/or warrant-holders to recognize gain or income for tax purposes or otherwise increase their tax burden. We do not intend to make any cash distributions to shareholders or warrant-holders to pay taxes in connection with our business combination or thereafter. Accordingly, a shareholder or a warrant-holder may be required to satisfy any liability resulting from any such transactions with cash from its own funds or by selling all or a portion of such holder’s shares or warrants. In addition, we may effect a business combination with a target company in another jurisdiction (including, but not limited to, the jurisdiction in which the target company or business is located). As a result, shareholders and warrant-holders may be subject to additional income, withholding or other taxes with respect to their ownership of us after our initial business combination.\n\nRisks Associated With Acquiring and Operating a Business in Foreign Countries\n\nIf we pursue a target company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States for our initial business combination, we may face additional burdens in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing such initial business combination, and if we effect such initial business combination, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations.\n\nIf we pursue a target a company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States for our initial business combination, we would be subject to risks associated with cross-border business combinations, including in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing our initial business combination, conducting due diligence in a foreign jurisdiction, having such transaction approved by any local governments, regulators or agencies and changes in the purchase price based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\n\nIf we effect our initial business combination with such a company, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated with companies operating in an international setting, including any of the following:\n\n•| costs and difficulties inherent in managing cross-border business operations;  \n---|---  \n•| rules and regulations regarding currency redemption;  \n---|---  \n•| complex corporate withholding taxes on individuals;  \n---|---  \n•| laws governing the manner in which future business combinations may be effected;  \n---|---  \n•| exchange listing and/or delisting requirements;  \n---|---  \n•| tariffs and trade barriers;  \n---|---  \n•| regulations related to customs and import/export matters;  \n---|---  \n  \n66\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\n•| local or regional economic policies and market conditions;  \n---|---  \n•| unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;  \n---|---  \n•| challenges in managing and staffing international operations;  \n---|---  \n•| longer payment cycles;  \n---|---  \n•| tax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States;  \n---|---  \n•| currency fluctuations and exchange controls;  \n---|---  \n•| rates of inflation;  \n---|---  \n•| challenges in collecting accounts receivable;  \n---|---  \n•| cultural and language differences;  \n---|---  \n•| employment regulations;  \n---|---  \n•| underdeveloped or unpredictable legal or regulatory systems;  \n---|---  \n•| corruption;  \n---|---  \n•| protection of intellectual property;  \n---|---  \n•| social unrest, crime, strikes, riots, civil disturbances and wars;  \n---|---  \n•| regime changes and political upheaval; and  \n---|---  \n•| deterioration of political relations with the United States.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe may not be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we were unable to do so, we may be unable to complete such initial business combination, or, if we complete such initial business combination, our operations might suffer, either of which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nRisks Relating to our Securities\n\nThe securities in which we invest the funds held in the trust account could bear a negative rate of interest, which could reduce the value of the assets held in trust such that the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders may be less than $10.20 per share.\n\nThe proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. While short-term U.S. government treasury obligations currently yield a positive rate of interest, they have briefly yielded negative interest rates in recent years. Central banks in Europe and Japan pursued interest rates below zero in recent years, and the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve has not ruled out the possibility that it may in the future adopt similar policies in the United States. In the event that we are unable to complete our initial business combination or make certain amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, our public shareholders are entitled to receive their pro-rata share of the proceeds held in the trust account, plus any interest income, net of taxes paid or payable (less, in the case we are unable to complete our initial business combination, $100,000 of interest). Negative interest rates could reduce the value of the assets held in trust such that the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders may be less than $10.20 per share.\n\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination.\n\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activities may be restricted, including:\n\n•| restrictions on the nature of our investments; and  \n---|---  \n•| restrictions on the issuance of securities,  \n---|---  \n  \n67\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\neach of which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. In addition, we may have imposed upon us burdensome requirements, including:\n\n•| registration as an investment company with the SEC;  \n---|---  \n•| adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and  \n---|---  \n•| reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations that we are currently not subject to.  \n---|---  \n  \nIn order not to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we must ensure that we are engaged primarily in a business other than investing, reinvesting or trading of securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading “investment securities” constituting more than 40% of our assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Our business will be to identify and complete a business combination and thereafter to operate the post-business combination business or assets for the long term. We do not plan to buy businesses or assets with a view to resale or profit from their resale. We do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive investor.\n\nWe do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in the trust account may only be invested in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Pursuant to the trust agreement, the trustee is not permitted to invest in other securities or assets. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, and by having a business plan targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses in the manner of a merchant bank or private equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an “investment company” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. This offering is not intended for persons who are seeking a return on investments in government securities or investment securities. The trust account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of either: (i) the completion of our initial business combination; (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (a) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity; or (iii) absent an initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering, our return of the funds held in the trust account to our public shareholders as part of our redemption of the public shares. If we do not invest the proceeds as discussed above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to complete a business combination. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.20 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.\n\nIf we do not consummate our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering, our public shareholders may be forced to wait beyond such applicable period before redemption from our trust account.\n\nIf we do not consummate our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering, the proceeds then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes paid or payable), will be used to fund the redemption of our public shares, as further described herein. Any redemption of public shareholders from the trust account will be effected automatically by function of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association prior to any voluntary winding up. If we are required to wind-up, liquidate the trust account and distribute such amount therein, pro rata, to our public shareholders, as part of any liquidation process, such winding up, liquidation and distribution must comply with the applicable provisions of the Companies Act. In that case, investors may be forced to wait beyond the applicable period from the closing \n\n68\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nof this offering before the redemption proceeds of our trust account become available to them, and they receive the return of their pro rata portion of the proceeds from our trust account. We have no obligation to return funds to investors prior to the date of our redemption or liquidation unless, prior thereto, we consummate our initial business combination or amend certain provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, and only then in cases where investors have sought to redeem their Class A ordinary shares. Only upon our redemption or any liquidation will public shareholders be entitled to distributions if we do not complete our initial business combination and do not amend certain provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law.\n\nOur shareholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares.\n\nIf we are forced to enter into an insolvent liquidation, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed as an unlawful payment if it was proved that immediately following the date on which the distribution was made, we were unable to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. As a result, a liquidator could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to us or our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing themselves and our company to claims, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. We and our directors and officers who knowingly and willfully authorized or permitted any distribution to be paid out of our share premium account while we were unable to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business would be guilty of an offence and may be liable for a fine of approximately $18,000 and imprisonment for five years in the Cayman Islands.\n\nWe are not registering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time, and such registration may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its warrants except on a cashless basis and potentially causing such warrants to expire worthless.\n\nWe are not registering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time. However, under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed that, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days after the closing of our initial business combination, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the issuance of such shares, and we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement to become effective within 60 business days after the closing of our initial business combination and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if, for example, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement or prospectus, the financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current, complete or correct or the SEC issues a stop order. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act in accordance with the above requirements, we will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, in which case, the number of Class A ordinary shares that you will receive upon cashless exercise will be based on a formula subject to a maximum amount of shares equal to 0.361 Class A ordinary shares per warrant (subject to adjustment). However, no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available. Notwithstanding the above, if our Class A ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of public warrants who seek to exercise their warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. Exercising the warrants on a cashless basis could have the effect of reducing the potential “upside” of the holder’s investment in our company because the warrant holder will hold \n\n69\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\na smaller number of Class A ordinary shares upon a cashless exercise of the warrants they hold. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant, or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under applicable state securities laws and no exemption is available. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holder of such warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the Class A ordinary shares included in the units. There may be a circumstance where an exemption from registration exists for holders of our private placement warrants to exercise their warrants while a corresponding exemption does not exist for holders of the public warrants included as part of units sold in this offering. In such an instance, our sponsor, Apollo and their permitted transferees (which may include our directors and executive officers) would be able to exercise their warrants and sell the ordinary shares underlying their warrants while holders of our public warrants would not be able to exercise their warrants and sell the underlying ordinary shares. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying Class A ordinary shares for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem the warrants as set forth above even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise their warrants.\n\nThe warrants may become exercisable and redeemable for a security other than the Class A ordinary shares, and you will not have any information regarding such other security at this time.\n\nIn certain situations, including if we are not the surviving entity in our initial business combination, the warrants may become exercisable for a security other than the Class A ordinary shares. As a result, if the surviving company redeems your warrants for securities pursuant to the warrant agreement, you may receive a security in a company of which you do not have information at this time. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, the surviving company will be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to register the issuance of the security underlying the warrants within 20 business days of the closing of an initial business combination.\n\nCertain of our warrants are expected to be accounted for as a warrant liability and will be recorded at fair value upon issuance with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our ordinary shares or may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination.\n\nFollowing the consummation of this offering, we will account for the 15,250,000 warrants to be issued in connection with this offering (the 7,500,000 public warrants and the 7,750,000 private placement warrants assuming the underwriter’s over-allotment option is not exercised) in accordance with the guidance contained in Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (ASC 815-40). Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each warrant must be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, we will classify each warrant as a liability at its fair value. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in our statement of operations and therefore our reported earnings. The warrants are also subject to re-evaluation of the proper classification and accounting treatment at each reporting period based on evolving regulatory guidance. The impact of changes in fair value on earnings may have an adverse effect on the market price of our ordinary shares. In addition, potential targets may seek a SPAC that does not have warrants that are accounted for as a warrant liability, which may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination with a target business.\n\nThe grant of registration rights to our initial shareholders and holders of our private placement warrants may make it more difficult to complete our initial business combination, and the future exercise of such rights may adversely affect the market price of our Class A ordinary shares.\n\nPursuant to an agreement to be entered on or prior to the closing of this offering, our initial shareholders and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the resale of the Class A ordinary shares into which founder shares are convertible, holders of our private placement warrants and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the private placement warrants and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants and holders of warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans may demand that we register such warrants or the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of such warrants. The registration rights will be exercisable with respect to the founder shares and the private placement warrants and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of such private placement warrants. We will bear the cost of \n\n70\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nregistering these securities. The registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares. In addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial business combination more costly or difficult to conclude. This is because the shareholders of the target business may increase the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of our securities that is expected when the securities owned by our initial shareholders, holders of our private placement warrants or their respective permitted transferees are registered for resale. \n\nBecause we are neither limited to evaluating a target business in a particular industry sector nor have we selected any specific target businesses with which to pursue our initial business combination, you will be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of any particular target business’s operations.\n\nWe may pursue business combination opportunities in any sector, except that we will not, under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination solely with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. Because we have not yet selected or approached any specific target business with respect to a business combination, there is no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any particular target business’s operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition or prospects. To the extent we complete our initial business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which we combine. For example, if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development stage entity. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a business combination target. Accordingly, any shareholders or warrant holders who choose to remain shareholders or warrant holders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such shareholders and warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.\n\nWe may seek business combination opportunities in industries or sectors which may or may not be outside of our management’s areas of expertise.\n\nWe will consider a business combination outside of our management’s area of expertise if a business combination candidate is presented to us and we determine that such candidate offers an attractive acquisition opportunity for our company. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular business combination candidate, we cannot assure you that we will adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will not ultimately prove to be less favorable to investors in this offering than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in a business combination candidate. In the event we elect to pursue an acquisition outside of the areas of our management’s expertise, our management’s expertise may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation, and the information contained in this prospectus regarding the areas of our management’s expertise would not be relevant to an understanding of the business that we elect to acquire. As a result, our management may not be able to adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. Accordingly, any shareholders or warrant holders who choose to remain shareholders or warrant holders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such shareholders and warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.\n\nWe may issue additional Class A ordinary shares or preference shares to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination. We may also issue Class A ordinary shares upon the conversion of the founder shares at a ratio greater than one-to-one concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination as a result of the anti-dilution provisions contained in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our shareholders and likely present other risks.\n\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will authorize the issuance of up to 200,000,000 Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, 20,000,000 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, and 1,000,000 preference shares, par value $0.0001 per share. Immediately after this offering, \n\n71\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nthere will be 185,000,000 and 16,250,000 (assuming in each case that the underwriter has not exercised its over-allotment option and the surrender of 562,500 Class B ordinary shares) authorized but unissued Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares, respectively, available for issuance, which amount does not take into account shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of issued and outstanding warrants or shares issuable upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares. The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder thereof, as described herein. Immediately after this offering, there will be no preference shares outstanding.\n\nWe may issue a substantial number of additional Class A ordinary shares or preference shares to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination. We may also issue Class A ordinary shares in connection with our redeeming the warrants as described in “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants” or upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares at a ratio greater than one-to-one concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination as a result of the anti-dilution provisions as set forth herein. However, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide, among other things, that prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote as a class with our public shares (a) on any initial business combination or (b) to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the time we have to consummate a business combination beyond 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote. The issuance of additional ordinary or preference shares:\n\n•| may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in this offering, which dilution would increase if the anti-dilution provisions in the Class B ordinary shares resulted in the issuance of Class A ordinary shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares;  \n---|---  \n•| may subordinate the rights of holders of Class A ordinary shares if preference shares are issued with rights senior to those afforded our Class A ordinary shares;  \n---|---  \n•| could cause a change in control if a substantial number of Class A ordinary shares are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors;  \n---|---  \n•| may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us;  \n---|---  \n•| may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our units, Class A ordinary shares and/or warrants; and  \n---|---  \n•| may not result in adjustment to the exercise price of our warrants.  \n---|---  \n  \nUnlike some other similarly structured special purpose acquisition companies, our initial shareholders will receive additional Class A ordinary shares if we issue shares to consummate an initial business combination.\n\nThe founder shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder thereof, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for share subdivisions, share dividends, rights issuances, reorganizations, recapitalizations and other similar transactions, and subject to further adjustment as provided herein. However, if additional Class A ordinary shares or any other equity-linked securities are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts issued in this offering and related to the closing of our initial business combination, the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all founder shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of (i) the total number of ordinary shares outstanding upon completion of this offering plus (ii) the total number of Class A ordinary shares issued, or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of the initial business combination, excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A ordinary shares issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial business combination and any private placement warrants issued to our sponsor upon conversion of working capital loans, provided that such conversion of Class B ordinary shares will never occur on a less than one-for-one basis. This is \n\n72\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\ndifferent than some other similarly structured special purpose acquisition companies in which the initial shareholders will only be issued an aggregate of 20% of the total number of shares to be outstanding prior to the initial business combination.\n\nResources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may only receive only approximately $10.20 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account, and our warrants will expire worthless.\n\nWe anticipate that the investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we decide not to complete a specific initial business combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to complete our initial business combination for any number of reasons including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.20 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.\n\nAn investment in our securities, and certain subsequent transactions with respect to our securities, may result in uncertain or adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences for an investor\n\nAn investment in our securities, and certain subsequent transactions with respect to our securities, may result in uncertain U.S. federal income tax consequences for an investor. For instance, because there are no authorities that directly address the U.S. federal income tax implications of instruments similar to the units we are issuing in this offering, the allocation an investor makes with respect to the purchase price of a unit between the Class A ordinary shares and the one-half of one warrant to purchase one Class A ordinary share included in each unit could be challenged by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or the courts. Furthermore, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of a cashless exercise of warrants is unclear under current law. Finally, it is unclear whether the redemption rights with respect to our Class A ordinary shares suspend the running of a U.S. Holder’s (as defined below in “Taxation—United States Federal Income Tax Considerations—General”) holding period for purposes of determining whether any gain or loss realized by such holder on the sale or exchange of Class A ordinary shares is long-term capital gain or loss and for determining whether any dividend we pay would be considered “qualified dividends” eligible for favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment. See the section of this prospectus captioned “Taxation—United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” for a summary of the U.S. federal income tax considerations of an investment in our securities. Prospective investors are urged to consult with and rely on their tax advisors with respect to these and other tax consequences when purchasing, holding or disposing of our securities.\n\nWe may be a passive foreign investment company, or “PFIC,” which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. investors.\n\nIf we are a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this prospectus captioned “Taxation — United States Federal Income Tax Considerations — General”) of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants, the U.S. Holder may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences and may be subject to additional reporting requirements. Our PFIC status for our current and subsequent taxable years may depend on, among other things, whether we qualify for the PFIC start-up exception, the timing of our business combination, the amount of our passive income and assets in the year of the business combination, and the amount of passive income and assets of the acquired business (see the section of this prospectus captioned “Taxation — United States Federal Income Tax Considerations — U.S. Holders — Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules”). Our actual PFIC status for our current taxable year or any subsequent taxable year will not be determinable until after the end of such taxable year (and in the case of our start-up year, possibly not until after the close of the second taxable year following our start-up year). Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will not be a PFIC in our current taxable year or in any future taxable year. \n\nIf we determine we are a PFIC for any taxable year, upon written request by a U.S. Holder, we will endeavor to provide to a U.S. Holder such information as the IRS may require, including a PFIC annual information statement, \n\n73\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nin order to enable the U.S. Holder to make and maintain a “qualified electing fund” (“QEF”) election, but there can be no assurance that we will timely provide such required information, and such election would be unavailable with respect to our warrants in all cases. The rules dealing with PFICs and with the QEF election are very complex and are affected by various factors in addition to those described in this prospectus. Accordingly, U.S. investors are strongly urged to consult with and rely solely upon their own tax advisors regarding the application of the PFIC rules to them in their particular circumstances. For a more detailed discussion of the tax consequences of PFIC classification to U.S. Holders, see the section of this prospectus captioned “Taxation — United States Federal Income Tax Considerations — U.S. Holders — Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules.”\n\nWe are subject to changing law and regulations regarding regulatory matters, corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of non-compliance.\n\nWe are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies, including, for example, the SEC, which are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded, and to new and evolving regulatory measures under applicable law. Our efforts to comply with new and changing laws and regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\n\nMoreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. If we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes, we may be subject to penalty and our business may be harmed.\n\nWe may reincorporate in another jurisdiction in connection with our initial business combination and such reincorporation may result in taxes imposed on shareholders or warrant holders.\n\nWe may, in connection with our initial business combination and subject to requisite shareholder approval under the Companies Act, reincorporate in the jurisdiction in which the target company or business is located or in another jurisdiction. The transaction may require a shareholder or warrant holder to recognize taxable income in the jurisdiction in which the shareholder or warrant holder is a tax resident or in which its members are resident if it is a tax transparent entity. We do not intend to make any cash distributions to shareholders or warrant holder to pay such taxes. Shareholders or warrant holder may be subject to withholding taxes or other taxes with respect to their ownership of us after the reincorporation.\n\nAfter our initial business combination, it is possible that a majority of our directors and officers will live outside the United States and all of our assets will be located outside the United States; therefore, investors may not be able to enforce federal securities laws or their other legal rights.\n\nIt is possible that after our initial business combination, a majority of our directors and officers will reside outside of the United States and all of our assets will be located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult, or in some cases not possible, for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights, to effect service of process upon all of our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties on our directors and officers under United States laws.\n\nWe may issue notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial debt, to complete a business combination, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our shareholders’ investment in us.\n\nAlthough we have no commitments as of the date of this prospectus to issue any notes or other debt securities, or to otherwise incur outstanding debt following this offering, we may choose to incur substantial debt to complete our initial business combination. We and our officers have agreed that we will not incur any indebtedness unless we have obtained from the lender a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to the monies held in the trust account. As such, no issuance of debt will affect the per share amount available for redemption from the trust account. Nevertheless, the incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including:\n\n•| default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;  \n---|---  \n  \n74\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\n•| acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;  \n---|---  \n•| our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt is payable on demand;   \n---|---  \n•| our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt is outstanding;  \n---|---  \n•| our inability to pay dividends on our Class A ordinary shares;  \n---|---  \n•| using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our Class A ordinary shares if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;  \n---|---  \n•| limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;  \n---|---  \n•| increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation or prevailing interest rates; and  \n---|---  \n•| limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe may seek business combination opportunities with a high degree of complexity that require significant operational improvements, which could delay or prevent us from achieving our desired results.\n\nWe may seek business combination opportunities with large, highly complex companies that we believe would benefit from operational improvements. While we intend to implement such improvements, to the extent that our efforts are delayed or we are unable to achieve the desired improvements, the business combination may not be as successful as we anticipate.\n\nTo the extent we complete our initial business combination with a large complex business or entity with a complex operating structure, we may also be affected by numerous risks inherent in the operations of the business with which we combine, which could delay or prevent us from implementing our strategy. Although our management team will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business and its operations, we may not be able to properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors until we complete our business combination. If we are not able to achieve our desired operational improvements, or the improvements take longer to implement than anticipated, we may not achieve the gains that we anticipate. Furthermore, some of these risks and complexities may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks and complexities will adversely impact a target business. Such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a smaller, less complex organization.\n\nIn order to effectuate an initial business combination, special purpose acquisition companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and other governing instruments, including their warrant agreements. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or governing instruments in a manner that will make it easier for us to complete an initial business combination that some of our shareholders may not support.\n\nIn order to effectuate a business combination, special purpose acquisition companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and governing instruments, including their warrant agreements. For example, special purpose acquisition companies have amended the definition of business combination, increased redemption thresholds and extended the time to consummate an initial business combination and, with respect to their warrants, amended their warrant agreements to require the warrants to be exchanged for cash and/or other securities. Amending our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will require at least a special resolution of our shareholders as a matter of Cayman Islands law, meaning the approval of holders of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company, and amending our warrant agreement in a manner that would adversely impact the registered holders of public warrants will require a vote of holders of at least 50% of the public warrants and, solely with respect to any amendment to the terms of the private placement warrants or any provision of the warrant agreement with respect to the private placement warrants, at least 50% of \n\n75\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nthe then issued and outstanding private placement warrants. In addition, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will require us to provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash if we propose an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (i) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity. To the extent any of such amendments would be deemed to fundamentally change the nature of any of the securities offered through this registration statement, we would register, or seek an exemption from registration for, the affected securities. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or governing instruments or extend the time to consummate an initial business combination in order to effectuate our initial business combination.\n\nOur letter agreement with our initial shareholders, officers and directors and registration rights agreement may be amended, and provisions therein may be waived, without shareholder approval.\n\nOur letter agreement with our initial shareholders, officers and directors contain provisions relating to transfer restrictions of our founder shares and private placement warrants, indemnification of the trust account, waiver of redemption rights and participation in liquidating distributions from the trust account. The letter agreement and the registration rights agreement may be amended, and provisions therein may be waived, without shareholder approval (although releasing the parties from the restriction contained in the letter agreement not to transfer any units, warrants, Class A ordinary shares or any other securities convertible into, or exercisable, or exchangeable for, Class A ordinary shares for 180 days following the date of this prospectus will require the prior written consent of Needham & Company, LLC). While we do not expect our board to approve any amendment to or waiver of the letter agreement or registration rights agreement prior to our initial business combination, it may be possible that our board, in exercising its business judgment and subject to its fiduciary duties, chooses to approve one or more amendments to or waivers of such agreements. Any such amendments or waivers would not require approval from our shareholders and may have an adverse effect on the value of an investment in our securities.\n\nWe may be unable to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination or to fund the operations and growth of a target business, which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.20 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless.\n\nAlthough we believe that the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants will be sufficient to allow us to complete our initial business combination, we cannot ascertain the capital requirements for any particular transaction because we have not yet selected any prospective target business. If the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants prove to be insufficient, either because of the size of our initial business combination, the depletion of the available net proceeds in search of a target business, the obligation to repurchase for cash a significant number of shares from shareholders who elect redemption in connection with our initial business combination, the sale of the forward purchase securities does not close or the terms of negotiated transactions to purchase shares in connection with our initial business combination, we may be required to seek additional financing or to abandon the proposed business combination. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The current economic environment may make it difficult for companies to obtain acquisition financing. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to complete our initial business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.20 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. In addition, even if we do not need additional financing to complete our initial business combination, we may require such financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of our officers, directors or shareholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination.\n\n76\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nOur initial shareholders control a substantial interest in us and thus may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support.\n\nUpon closing of this offering, our initial shareholders will own 20% of our outstanding ordinary shares (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering). Accordingly, they may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support, including amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. If our initial shareholders purchase any units in this offering or if our initial shareholders purchase any additional Class A ordinary shares in the aftermarket or in privately negotiated transactions, this would increase their control. Neither our initial shareholders nor, to our knowledge, any of our officers or directors, have any current intention to purchase additional securities, other than as disclosed in this prospectus. Factors that would be considered in making such additional purchases would include consideration of the current trading price of our Class A ordinary shares. In addition, our board of directors, whose members were appointed by our sponsor, is and will be divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being appointed in each year. We may not hold an annual general meeting to appoint new directors prior to the completion of our initial business combination, in which case all of the current directors will continue in office until at least the completion of the business combination. If there is an annual general meeting, as a consequence of our “staggered” board of directors, only a minority of the board of directors will be considered for appointment and our initial shareholders, because of their ownership position, will have considerable influence regarding the outcome following our initial business combination. In addition, prior to our initial business combination, only holders of our Class B ordinary shares have the right to vote on the appointment of directors, including in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and holders of a majority of our Class B ordinary shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason. As a result, holders of Class A ordinary shares will not have the right to appoint any directors until after the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. Accordingly, our initial shareholders will continue to exert substantial control at least until the completion of our initial business combination.\n\nOur sponsor contributed $25,000 and, accordingly, you will experience immediate and substantial dilution from the purchase of our Class A ordinary shares.\n\nThe difference between the public offering price per share (allocating all of the unit purchase price to the Class A ordinary share and none to the warrant included in the unit) and the pro forma net tangible book value per Class A ordinary share after this offering constitutes the dilution to you and the other investors in this offering. Our sponsor acquired the founder shares at a nominal price, significantly contributing to this dilution.\n\nUpon closing of this offering you and the other public shareholders will incur an immediate and substantial dilution of approximately 91.0% (or $9.10 per share, assuming no exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option), the difference between the pro forma net tangible book value per share of $0.90 and the initial offering price of $10.00 per unit. This dilution would increase to the extent that the anti-dilution provisions of the founder shares result in the issuance of Class A ordinary shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the founder shares concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination and would become exacerbated to the extent that public shareholders seek redemptions from the trust for their public shares. In addition, because of the anti-dilution protection in the founder shares, any equity or equity-linked securities issued in connection with our initial business combination would be disproportionately dilutive to our Class A ordinary shares.\n\nWe may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders of public warrants with the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants. As a result, the exercise price of your warrants could be increased, the exercise period could be shortened and the number of Class A ordinary shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant could be decreased, all without your approval.\n\nOur warrants will be issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder for the purpose of (i) curing any ambiguity or correct any mistake, including to conform the provisions of the warrant agreement to the description of the terms of the warrants and the warrant agreement set forth in this prospectus, or defective provision (ii) amending the provisions relating to cash dividends on ordinary shares as contemplated by and in accordance with the warrant agreement or (iii) adding or changing any provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the warrant agreement as the parties to \n\n77\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nthe warrant agreement may deem necessary or desirable and that the parties deem to not adversely affect the rights of the registered holders of the warrants, provided that the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants is required to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of public warrants. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment and, solely with respect to any amendment to the terms of the private placement warrants or any provision of the warrant agreement with respect to the private placement warrants, at least 50% of the number of the then outstanding private placement warrants. Although our ability to amend the terms of the public warrants with the consent of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, convert the warrants into cash, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of Class A ordinary shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant.\n\nOur warrant agreement will designate the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company.\n\nOur warrant agreement will provide that, subject to applicable law, (i) any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the warrant agreement, including under the Securities Act, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and (ii) that we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. We will waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courts represent an inconvenient forum.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions of the warrant agreement will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our warrants shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our warrant agreement. If any action, the subject matter of which is within the scope the forum provisions of the warrant agreement, is filed in a court other than a court of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (a “foreign action”) in the name of any holder of our warrants, such holder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of New York in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an “enforcement action”), and (y) having service of process made upon such warrant holder in any such enforcement action by service upon such warrant holder’s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such warrant holder.\n\nThis choice-of-forum provision may limit a warrant holder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with our company, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our warrant agreement inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors.\n\nWe may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless.\n\nWe have the ability to redeem the outstanding public warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under the heading “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants — Anti-Dilution Adjustments”) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to proper notice of such redemption and provided that certain other conditions are met. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem the warrants as set forth above even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise the warrants. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you to (i) exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) sell your warrants at the then-current market \n\n78\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nprice when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, we expect would be substantially less than the market value of your warrants. None of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us (except as described below under “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants — Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00”) so long as they are held by our sponsor, Apollo or their permitted transferees.\n\nIn addition, we have the ability to redeem the outstanding public warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption provided that the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $10.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under the heading “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants — Anti-Dilution Adjustments”) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to proper notice of such redemption and provided that certain other conditions are met, including that holders will be able to exercise their warrants prior to redemption for a number of Class A ordinary shares determined based on the redemption date and the fair market value of our Class A ordinary shares. Please see “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants — Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00.” The value received upon exercise of the warrants (1) may be less than the value the holders would have received if they had exercised their warrants at a later time where the underlying share price is higher and (2) may not compensate the holders for the value of the warrants, including because the number of ordinary shares received is capped at 0.361 Class A ordinary shares per warrant (subject to adjustment) irrespective of the remaining life of the warrants.\n\nNone of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us as (except as set forth under “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants — Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00”) so long as they are held by our sponsor, Apollo or their permitted transferees.\n\nNone of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us on such terms so long as they are held by their initial purchasers or their permitted transferees.\n\nOur warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares and make it more difficult to effectuate our initial business combination.\n\nWe will be issuing warrants to purchase 7,500,000 Class A ordinary shares (or up to up to 8,625,000 Class A ordinary shares if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) as part of the units offered by this prospectus and, simultaneously with the closing of this offering, we will be issuing in a private placement an aggregate of 7,750,000 private placement warrants (or 8,650,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full), each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. In addition, if the sponsor makes any working capital loans, it may convert up to $1,500,000 of such loans into up to an additional 1,500,000 warrants, at the price of $1.00 per warrant. We may also issue Class A ordinary shares in connection with our redemption of warrants as described in “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants.” To the extent we issue ordinary shares for any reason, including to effectuate a business combination, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional Class A ordinary shares upon exercise of these warrants could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business. Such warrants, when exercised, will increase the number of outstanding Class A ordinary shares and reduce the value of the Class A ordinary shares issued to complete the business transaction. Therefore, our warrants may make it more difficult to effectuate a business transaction or increase the cost of acquiring the target business.\n\nBecause each unit contains one-half of one warrant and only a whole warrant may be exercised, the units may be worth less than units of other special purpose acquisition companies.\n\nEach unit contains one-half of one warrant. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, no fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units, and only whole units will trade. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number of Class A ordinary shares to be issued to the warrant holder. This is different from other offerings similar to ours whose units include one ordinary share and one whole warrant to purchase one whole share. We have established the components of the units in this way in order to reduce the dilutive effect of the warrants upon \n\n79\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\ncompletion of a business combination since the warrants will be exercisable in the aggregate for one-half of the number of shares compared to units that each contain a whole warrant to purchase one whole share, thus making us, we believe, a more attractive merger partner for target businesses. Nevertheless, this unit structure may cause our units to be worth less than if a unit included a warrant to purchase one whole share.\n\nThe determination of the public offering price of our units and the size of this offering is more arbitrary than the pricing of securities and size of an offering of an operating company in a particular industry. You may have less assurance, therefore, that the public offering price of our units properly reflects the value of such units than you would have in a typical offering of an operating company.\n\nPrior to this offering there has been no public market for any of our securities. The public offering price of the units and the terms of the warrants were negotiated between us and the underwriter. In determining the size of this offering, management held customary organizational meetings with Needham & Company, LLC, both prior to our inception and thereafter, with respect to the state of capital markets, generally, and the amount the underwriter believed it reasonably could raise on our behalf. Factors considered in determining the size of this offering, prices and terms of the units, including the Class A ordinary shares and warrants underlying the units, include:\n\n•| the history and prospects of companies whose principal business is the acquisition of other companies;  \n---|---  \n•| prior offerings of those companies;  \n---|---  \n•| our prospects for acquiring an operating business at attractive values;  \n---|---  \n•| a review of debt-to-equity ratios in leveraged transactions;  \n---|---  \n•| our capital structure;  \n---|---  \n•| an assessment of our management and their experience in identifying operating companies;  \n---|---  \n•| general conditions of the securities markets at the time of this offering; and  \n---|---  \n•| other factors as were deemed relevant.  \n---|---  \n  \nAlthough these factors were considered, the determination of our offering price is more arbitrary than the pricing of securities of an operating company in a particular industry since we have no historical operations or financial results.\n\nThere is currently no market for our securities and a market for our securities may not develop, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.\n\nThere is currently no market for our securities. Shareholders therefore have no access to information about prior market history on which to base their investment decision. Following this offering, the price of our securities may vary significantly due to one or more potential business combinations and general market or economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and other events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases). Furthermore, an active trading market for our securities may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established and sustained.\n\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\nWe are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to “emerging growth companies” or “smaller reporting companies,” this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\n\nWe are an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain \n\n80\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\ninformation they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Class A ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30th before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\n\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\n\nAdditionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year or the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.\n\nPast performance of our founders and the other members of our management team, including investments and transactions in which they have participated and businesses with which they have been associated, may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us, and we may be unable to provide positive returns to shareholders.\n\nInformation regarding our founders and the other members of our management team, including investments and transactions in which they have participated and businesses with which they have been associated, is presented for informational purposes only. Any past experience and performance of our founders and the other members of our management team and the businesses with which they have been associated, including related to acquisitions and shareholder returns, is not a guarantee that we will be able to successfully identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination, that we will be able to provide positive returns to our shareholders, or of any results with respect to any initial business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical experiences of our founders or the other members of our management team, including investments and transactions in which they have participated and businesses with which they have been associated, as indicative of the future performance of an investment in us, including whether we can provide an attractive return to our shareholders, or as indicative of every prior investment by each of our founders and the other members of our management team. The market price of our securities may be influenced by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, and our shareholders may experience losses on their investment in our securities.\n\nWe are dependent upon our executive officers and directors and their loss could adversely affect our ability to operate.\n\nOur operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals and, in particular, our executive officers and directors. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our officers and directors, at least until we have completed our initial business combination. In addition, our executive officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest \n\n81\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nin allocating their time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. We do not have an employment agreement with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our directors or executive officers. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or executive officers could have a detrimental effect on us.\n\nOur executive officers, directors, security holders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests.\n\nWe have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, executive officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. In fact, we may enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our sponsor, our directors or executive officers, although we do not intend to do so. Nor do we have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours.\n\nThe personal and financial interests of our directors and officers may influence their motivation in timely identifying and selecting a target business and completing a business combination. Consequently, our directors’ and officers’ discretion in identifying and selecting a suitable target business may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether the terms, conditions and timing of a particular business combination are appropriate and in our shareholders’ best interest. If this were the case, it would be a breach of their fiduciary duties to us as a matter of Cayman Islands law and we or our shareholders might have a claim against such individuals for infringing on our shareholders’ rights. See the section titled “Description of Securities — Certain Differences in Corporate Law — Shareholders’ Suits” for further information on the ability to bring such claims. However, we might not ultimately be successful in any claim we may make against them for such reason.\n\nCompliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may make it more difficult for us to effectuate a business combination, require substantial financial and management resources, and increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition.\n\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2022. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target business with which we seek to complete our initial business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.\n\nBecause we are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, you may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through the U.S. federal courts may be limited.\n\nWe are an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon our directors or executive officers, or enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against our directors or officers.\n\nOur corporate affairs will be governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the Companies Act (as the same may be supplemented or amended from time to time) and the common law of the Cayman Islands. We will also be subject to the federal securities laws of the United States. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority, but are not binding on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are different from what they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as \n\n82\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\ncompared to the United States, and certain states, such as Delaware, may have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholders derivative action in a federal court of the United States.\n\nWe have been advised by Maples and Calder (Cayman) LLP, our Cayman Islands legal counsel, that the courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (i) to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state; and (ii) in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of which is, contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy). A Cayman Islands Court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.\n\nAs a result of all of the above, public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a U.S. company.\n\nProvisions in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our Class A ordinary shares and could entrench management.\n\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that shareholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include a staggered board of directors, advance notice procedures, inability of shareholders to call a general meeting, removal of directors only for cause (other than by holders of our Class B ordinary shares prior to our initial business combination) and only by the board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preference shares, and the fact that prior to the completion of our initial business combination only holders of our Class B ordinary shares are entitled to vote on the appointment of directors, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\n\nCyber incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\n\nWe depend on digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, including those of third parties with which we may deal. Sophisticated and deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in, our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud, could lead to corruption or misappropriation of our assets, proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. As an early stage company without significant investments in data security protection, we may not be sufficiently protected against such occurrences. We may not have sufficient resources to adequately protect against, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to, cyber incidents. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have adverse consequences on our business and lead to financial loss.\n\nSince only holders of our founder shares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors, upon the listing of our shares on Nasdaq, Nasdaq may consider us to be a “controlled company” within the meaning of Nasdaq rules and, as a result, we may qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\n\nAfter completion of this offering, only holders of our founder shares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors. As a result, Nasdaq may consider us to be a “controlled company” within the meaning of Nasdaq corporate governance standards. Under Nasdaq corporate governance standards, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that:\n\n83\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\n•| we have a board that includes a majority of “independent directors,” as defined under Nasdaq rules;  \n---|---  \n•| we have a compensation committee of our board that is comprised entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities; and  \n---|---  \n•| we have independent director oversight of our director nominations.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe do not intend to utilize these exemptions and intend to comply with the corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq, subject to applicable phase-in rules. However, if we determine in the future to utilize some or all of these exemptions, you will not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.\n\nIf our management following our initial business combination is unfamiliar with United States securities laws, they may have to expend time and resources becoming familiar with such laws, which could lead to various regulatory issues.\n\nFollowing our initial business combination, our management may resign from their positions as officers or directors of the company and the management of the target business at the time of the business combination will remain in place. Management of the target business may not be familiar with U.S. securities laws. If new management is unfamiliar with U.S. securities laws, they may have to expend time and resources becoming familiar with such laws. This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues which may adversely affect our operations.\n\nAfter our initial business combination, substantially all of our assets may be located in a foreign country and substantially all of our revenue may be derived from our operations in any such country. Accordingly, our results of operations and prospects will be subject, to a significant extent, to the economic, political and social conditions and government policies, developments and conditions in the country in which we operate.\n\nThe economic, political and social conditions, as well as government policies, of the country in which our operations are located could affect our business. Economic growth could be uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy and such growth may not be sustained in the future. If in the future such country’s economy experiences a downturn or grows at a slower rate than expected, there may be less demand for spending in certain industries. A decrease in demand for spending in certain industries could materially and adversely affect our ability to find an attractive target business with which to consummate our initial business combination and if we effect our initial business combination, the ability of that target business to become profitable.\n\nExchange rate fluctuations and currency policies may cause a target business’ ability to succeed in the international markets to be diminished.\n\nIn the event we acquire a non-U.S. target, all revenues and income would likely be received in a foreign currency, and the dollar equivalent of our net assets and distributions, if any, could be adversely affected by reductions in the value of the local currency. The value of the currencies in our target regions fluctuate and are affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions. Any change in the relative value of such currency against our reporting currency may affect the attractiveness of any target business or, following consummation of our initial business combination, our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if a currency appreciates in value against the dollar prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, the cost of a target business as measured in dollars will increase, which may make it less likely that we are able to consummate such transaction.\n\nWe may reincorporate in another jurisdiction in connection with our initial business combination, and the laws of such jurisdiction may govern some or all of our future material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights.\n\nIn connection with our initial business combination, we may relocate the home jurisdiction of our business from the Cayman Islands to another jurisdiction. If we determine to do this, the laws of such jurisdiction may govern some or all of our future material agreements. The system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdiction may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the United States. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our future agreements could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities or capital.\n\n84\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nSome of the statements contained in this prospectus may constitute “forward-looking statements” for purposes of the federal securities laws. Our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our or our management team’s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “would” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements in this prospectus may include, for example, statements about:\n\n•| our ability to select an appropriate target business or businesses;  \n---|---  \n•| our ability to complete our initial business combination;  \n---|---  \n•| our expectations around the performance of the prospective target business;  \n---|---  \n•| our success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, our officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination;  \n---|---  \n•| our officers and directors allocating their time to other businesses and potentially having conflicts of interest with our business or in approving our initial business combination;  \n---|---  \n•| our potential ability to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination;  \n---|---  \n•| our pool of prospective target businesses;  \n---|---  \n•| our ability to consummate an initial business combination due to the uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and other events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases);  \n---|---  \n•| the ability of our officers and directors to generate a number of potential business combination opportunities;  \n---|---  \n•| our public securities’ potential liquidity and trading;  \n---|---  \n•| the lack of a market for our securities;  \n---|---  \n•| the use of proceeds not held in the trust account or available to us from interest income on the trust account balance;  \n---|---  \n•| the trust account not being subject to claims of third parties; or  \n---|---  \n•| our financial performance following this offering.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe forward-looking statements contained in this prospectus are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described under the heading “Risk Factors.” Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.\n\n85\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nUSE OF PROCEEDS\n\nWe are offering 15,000,000 units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit.

These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $627,366 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that offering expenses are less than as set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses. If offering expenses are greater than set forth in this table, such excess will reduce amounts available post-closing for working capital expenses.  \n---|---  \n(3)| The underwriter has agreed to defer underwriting commissions of 3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial business combination, up to $5,250,000, which constitutes the underwriter’s deferred commissions (or up to $6,037,500 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriter from the funds held in the trust account. Up to $0.0525 per unit, or up to $787,500 (or $905,625 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) of such amount may instead be paid, at our sole discretion, to third parties not participating in this offering (but are FINRA members) that assist us in consummating our initial business combination. See “Underwriting.” The remaining funds, less amounts used to pay redeeming shareholders, will be released to us and can be used to pay   \n---|---  \n  \n86\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nall or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. The underwriter will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions. The underwriter has agreed to reimburse us up to $500,000 for expenses related to this offering.\n\n(4)| These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination. In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust account. The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Assuming an interest rate of 0.1% per year, we estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $153,000 per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. The trust account’s earnings will be lower if interest rates on short-term U.S. government treasury obligations decline.  \n---|---  \n(5)| Assumes no exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option.  \n---|---  \n(6)| Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our initial business combination to fund a “no-shop” provision and commitment fees for financing.  \n---|---  \n  \nNasdaq rules provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust account. Of the $157,750,000 in proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants described in this prospectus, or $181,150,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full, $153,000,000 ($10.20 per unit), or $175,950,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full ($10.20 per unit), will be deposited into a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and $7,750,000, or up to $8,650,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full, will be used to pay expenses in connection with the closing of this offering and for working capital following this offering. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay our taxes, if any, until the earliest of (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law, or (iii) the redemption of our public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (a) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity. Based on current interest rates, we expect that interest income earned on the trust account (if any) will be sufficient to pay our income taxes.\n\nThe net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial business combination and to pay the deferred underwriting commissions. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or the redemption of our public shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-business combination company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination.\n\nWe believe that amounts not held in trust, together with funds available to us from loans from our sponsor, will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our sponsor, \n\n87\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nmembers of our management team or any of their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us. However, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide, among other things, that prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote as a class with our public shares (a) on any initial business combination or (b) to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the time we have to consummate a business combination beyond 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering.\n\nWe will reimburse an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, secretarial and administrative services provided to members of our management team, in an amount not to exceed $10,000 per month. In the future, we, upon consultation with the compensation committee of our board of directors, may decide to compensate our executive officers and other employees.\n\nPrior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to $300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of April 30, 2022 or the closing of this offering. The loans will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the $627,366 of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses (without giving effect to the underwriter’s reimbursement to us). As of June 30, 2021, there was $35,000 outstanding under this sponsor loan.\n\nIn addition, in order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans may be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination company at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. Such warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. Except as set forth above, the terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our founders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our founders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and the rules of Nasdaq. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going- private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.\n\nWe will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriter’s fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business combination.\n\nA public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business combination, and then only in connection with those public shares that such \n\n88\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nshareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described in this prospectus, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to modify (A) the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. \n\nOur founders, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity. In addition, our founders, officers and directors have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time frame. However, if our founders or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. Permitted transferees of the founder shares held by our founders, officers and directors would be subject to the same restrictions applicable to our founders, officers and directors, respectively.\n\nApollo has expressed to us an interest to purchase an aggregate of approximately $14,985,000 or approximately 9.99%, of the units in this offering at the public offering price, and we have agreed to direct the underwriter to sell to Apollo such amount of units, subject to our satisfying the Nasdaq listing requirement that we have a minimum of 400 round lot holders of our units. Subject to Apollo purchasing at least 9.99% of the units in this offering and 100,000 private placement warrants concurrently with this offering (i) at the closing of this offering, we will issue and sell 175,000 founder shares, and (ii) at the closing of our initial business combination, we will issue and sell an additional 125,000 founder shares to Apollo less such number of shares subject to a reduction in ownership (as described below). The purchase price for the founder shares in each case will be $0.0058 per share and our sponsor will automatically forfeit to the company for cancellation, for $0.0058 per share, a number of founder shares equal to the number of founder shares purchased by Apollo. However, if Apollo does not enter into a binding commitment to purchase an amount of Class A ordinary shares with a value of at least $25,000,000 (or equivalent securities of the target of the business combination or the successor registrant of the Company) in a private placement financing that will close concurrently with the closing of the initial business combination, the number of founder shares that Apollo will be entitled to purchase at the closing of our initial business combination will be reduced up to 125,000 founder shares on a pro rata basis. Additionally, if immediately following the closing of the initial business combination, (i) Apollo owns less than 100% but more than 50% of the 9.99% of the Class A ordinary shares sold by the company in this offering (including any shares sold by the underwriter in connection with the exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option), then Apollo will forfeit its right to purchase up to 50,000 founder shares on a pro rata basis, or (ii) Apollo owns less than 50% of the 9.99% of the Class A ordinary shares sold by the Company in this offering (including any shares sold by the underwriter in connection with the exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option), then Apollo will forfeit its right to purchase up to 75,000 founder shares in addition to the forfeiture of 50,000 founder shares pursuant to (i) on a pro rata basis. In the event our sponsor deems it necessary in order to facilitate an initial business combination for the sponsor to forfeit, transfer, exchange or amend the terms of all or any portion of the founder shares or to enter into any other arrangements with respect to the founder shares (including, without limitation, a transfer of the sponsor’s membership interests representing an interest in any of the foregoing), such change in investment will apply pro rata to Apollo and our sponsor based on the relative number \n\n89\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nof founder shares to be held by each, and, accordingly, Apollo will forfeit its right to purchase up to 125,000 founder shares as necessary to facilitate the foregoing. In the event that a reduction of ownership in Apollo’s founder shares exceeds the 125,000 additional founder shares eligible for purchase by Apollo, effective on the closing of an initial business combination, Apollo will forfeit to us, for reissuance to our sponsor, an amount of its additional founder shares previously purchased equal to such excess, provided that Apollo will not be required to forfeit more than 125,000 of the additional founder shares purchased (such that Apollo will in all circumstances be allowed to retain at least 50,000 founder shares).\n\nWe have agreed to reissue to our sponsor, at a price of $0.0058 per share, a number of founder shares equal to any founder shares or rights to purchase founder shares forfeited by Apollo.\n\nBecause these expressions of interest are not binding agreements or commitments to purchase, Apollo may determine to purchase more, fewer or no units in this offering or the underwriter may determine to sell more, fewer or no units to Apollo. In the event that Apollo does not purchase at least the amount of units for which it has expressed an interest and the warrants, as described herein, Apollo will not be entitled to purchase from our sponsor the founder shares described in this prospectus. In the event that Apollo purchases such units (either in this offering or after) and votes its public shares in favor of our initial business combination, a smaller portion of affirmative votes from other public shareholders would be required to approve our initial business combination. Apollo is required to vote its public shares in favor of our initial business combination. However, because Apollo is not obligated to continue owning any public shares following the closing, we cannot assure you that Apollo will be a shareholder at the time of our initial business combination. Apollo is required to vote its public shares in favor of our initial business combination.\n\nThere is no ceiling on the number of units that may be purchased by Apollo in this offering or on the number of our units, shares or warrants that they may purchase after this offering. However, Apollo has not indicated that it would purchase any additional units in this offering or any of our securities after the closing of this offering.\n\nAlthough we and the underwriter are not required to sell Apollo units in this offering, we expect the underwriter to sell to Apollo units up to its expression of interest, subject to our satisfying the Nasdaq listing requirement that we have a minimum of 400 round lot holders of our units. We are not aware of any circumstances (other than the Nasdaq listing requirement) under which we or the underwriter would prohibit Apollo from purchasing the applicable number of units it has expressed an interest in purchasing in this offering.\n\nIn addition, the units (including the underlying public shares and warrants) Apollo may purchase in this offering will not be subject to any agreements restricting their transfer. \n\n90\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nDIVIDEND POLICY\n\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of our initial business combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of our initial business combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to our initial business combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. If we increase or decrease the size of this offering, we will effect a share capitalization or a share repurchase or redemption or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable, with respect to our Class B ordinary shares immediately prior to the consummation of this offering in such amount as to maintain the number of founder shares, on an as-converted basis, at 20% of the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares outstanding at such time (assuming the underwriter exercises its over-allotment option). Further, if we incur any indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.\n\n91\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nDILUTION\n\nThe difference between the public offering price per Class A ordinary share and the pro forma net tangible book value per Class A ordinary share after this offering constitutes the dilution to investors in this offering. Such calculation does not reflect any dilution associated with the sale and exercise of warrants, including the private placement warrants, which would cause the actual dilution to the public shareholders to be higher, particularly where a cashless exercise is utilized. Net tangible book value per share is determined by dividing our net tangible book value, which is our total tangible assets less total liabilities (including the value of Class A ordinary shares which may be redeemed for cash), by the number of issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares. In calculating the pro forma net tangible book value after this offering, we have given effect to the provision of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that will provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Accordingly, we have calculated pro forma net tangible book value in the table below assuming that holders of approximately 91.0% of our public shares may redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account at a per share redemption price equal to the amount in the trust account.\n\nAt June 30, 2021, our net tangible book deficit was $219,604, or approximately $(0.06) per Class B ordinary share (assumes no exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option). After giving effect to the sale of 15,000,000 Class A ordinary shares included in the units we are offering by this prospectus (or 17,250,000 Class A ordinary shares if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full), the sale of the private placement warrants and the deduction of underwriting commissions and estimated expenses of this offering, our pro forma net tangible book value at June 30, 2021 would have been $5,000,001 or $0.90 per share (or $5,000,001 or $0.79 per share if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full), representing an immediate increase in net tangible book value (as decreased by the value of 13,210,899 Class A ordinary shares that may be redeemed for cash, or 15,264,249 Class A ordinary shares if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) of $0.96 per share (or $0.84 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) to our initial shareholders as of the date of this prospectus. Total dilution to public shareholders from this offering will be $9.10 per share (or $9.21 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full).\n\nThe following table illustrates the dilution to the public shareholders on a per-share basis:\n\n​| ​| Without Over-Allotment| ​| ​| With Over-Allotment  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nPublic offering price| ​| ​| $10.00| ​| ​| $10.00  \nNet tangible book deficit before this offering| ​| ​| (0.06)| ​| ​| (0.05)  \nIncrease attributable to public shareholders| ​| ​| 0.96| ​| ​| 0.84  \nPro forma net tangible book value after this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants| ​| ​| 0.90| ​| ​| 0.79  \nDilution to public shareholders| ​| ​| $9.10| ​| ​| $9.21  \nPercentage of dilution to public shareholders| ​| ​| 91.0%| ​| ​| 92.1%  \n  \nFor purposes of presentation, we have reduced our pro forma net tangible book value after this offering (assuming no exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option) by $132,108,989 because holders of up to approximately 91.0% of our public shares may redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account at a per share redemption price equal to the amount in the trust account as set forth in our tender offer or proxy materials (initially anticipated to be the aggregate amount held in trust two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest and net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of Class A ordinary shares sold in this offering.\n\nThe following table sets forth information with respect to our initial shareholders and the public shareholders:\n\n​| ​| Shares Purchased| ​| ​| Total Consideration| ​| ​| Average Price per Share  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| Number| ​| ​| Percentage| ​| ​| Amount| ​| ​| Percentage| ​  \nClass B ordinary shares(1)| ​| ​| 3,750,000| ​| ​| 20.0%| ​| ​| $25,000| ​| ​| 0.02%| ​| ​| $0.007  \nPublic Shareholders| ​| ​| 15,000,000| ​| ​| 80.0%| ​| ​| 150,000,000| ​| ​| 99.98%| ​| ​| $10.00  \n​| ​| 18,750,000| ​| ​| 100.0%| ​| ​| $150,025,000| ​| ​| 100.0%| ​| ​  \n(1)| Assumes no exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option and the corresponding forfeiture of 562,500 Class B ordinary shares held by our sponsor.  \n---|---  \n  \n92\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nThe pro forma net tangible book value per share after the offering (assuming no exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option) is calculated as follows:\n\n​| ​| Without Over-allotment| ​| ​| With Over-allotment  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nNumerator:| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nNet tangible book deficit before this offering| ​| ​| $(219,604)| ​| ​| $(219,604)  \nNet proceeds from this offering and sale of the private placement warrants(1)| ​| ​| 154,622,634| ​| ​| 177,572,634  \nPlus: Offering costs accrued for or paid in advance, excluded from tangible book value before this offering| ​| ​| 233,463| ​| ​| 233,463  \nLess: Warrant liability| ​| ​| (12,277,500)| ​| ​| (13,906,500)  \nLess: Deferred underwriting commissions| ​| ​| (5,250,000)| ​| ​| (6,037,500)  \nLess: Proceeds held in trust subject to redemption to maintain net tangible assets of $5,000,001(2)| ​| ​| (132,108,989)| ​| ​| (152,642,489)  \n​| ​| $5,000,003| ​| ​| $5,000,003  \nDenominator:| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nClass B ordinary shares outstanding prior to this offering (founder shares)| ​| ​| 4,312,500| ​| ​| 4,312,500  \nClass B ordinary shares forfeited if over-allotment is not exercised| ​| ​| (562,500)| ​| ​| —  \nClass A ordinary shares included in the units offered| ​| ​| 15,000,000| ​| ​| 17,250,000  \nLess: Class A ordinary shares subject to redemption to maintain net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001| ​| ​| (13,210,899)| ​| ​| (15,264,249)  \n​| ​| 5,539,101| ​| ​| 6,298,251  \n(1)| Expenses applied against gross proceeds include offering expenses of $127,366 (after giving effect to the underwriter’s reimbursement to us) and underwriting commissions of $3,000,000 (if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is not exercised) or $3,450,000 (if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised) (in all cases excluding deferred underwriting fees). See “Use of Proceeds.”  \n---|---  \n(2)| If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. In the event of any such purchases of our shares prior to the completion of our initial business combination, the number of Class A ordinary shares subject to redemption will be reduced by the amount of any such purchases, increasing the pro forma net tangible book value per share. See “Proposed Business — Effecting Our Initial Business Combination — Permitted Purchases and Other Transactions with Respect to Our Securities.”  \n---|---  \n  \n93\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nCAPITALIZATION\n\nThe following table sets forth our capitalization at June 30, 2021, and as adjusted to give effect to the filing of our amended and rested memorandum and articles of association, the sale of our units in this offering and the private placement warrants and the application of the estimated net proceeds derived from the sale of such securities: \n\n​| ​| June 30, 2021  \n---|---|---  \n​| ​| Actual| ​| ​| As Adjusted(1)  \nNote payable—related party(4)| ​| ​| $—| ​| ​| $—  \nWarrant liability(2)| ​| ​| —| ​| ​| 12,277,500  \nDeferred underwriting commissions (3)| ​| ​| —| ​| ​| 5,250,000  \nClass A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption, 0 and 15,000,000 shares, actual and as adjusted, respectively(5)| ​| ​| —| ​| ​| 150,000,000  \nPreference shares, $0.0001 par value; 1,000,000 shares authorized; none issued and outstanding| ​| ​| —| ​| ​| —  \nClass A ordinary shares, $0.0001 par value, 200,000,000 shares authorized; 0 shares issued and outstanding (excluding 0 and 15,000,000 shares subject to possible redemption), actual and as adjusted, respectively(5)| ​| ​| —| ​| ​| —  \nClass B ordinary shares, $0.0001 par value, 20,000,000 shares authorized; 4,312,500 and 3,750,000 shares issued and outstanding, actual and as adjusted, respectively(1)| ​| ​| 431| ​| ​| 375  \nAdditional paid-in capital| ​| ​| 24,569| ​| ​| —  \nAccumulated deficit(6)| ​| ​| (11,142)| ​| ​| (12,891,382)  \nTotal shareholders’ equity| ​| ​| $​13,858| ​| ​| $​(12,891,008)  \nTotal capitalization| ​| ​| $​13,858| ​| ​| $154,636,492  \n(1)| Assumes no exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option and the corresponding forfeiture of 562,500 Class B ordinary shares held by our sponsor.  \n---|---  \n(2)| We will account for the 15,250,000 warrants to be issued in connection with this offering (the 7,500,000 public warrants and the 7,750,000 private placement warrants assuming the underwriter’s over-allotment option is not exercised) in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40. Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each warrant much be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, the company will classify each warrant as a liability at its fair value. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the company’s statement of operations.  \n---|---  \n(3)| $0.35 per unit, or $5,250,000 (or $6,037,500 if the over-allotment is exercised in full) in the aggregate, will be payable to the underwriter for deferred underwriting fees. The deferred underwriting fees will become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the trust account solely in the event that the company completes an initial business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. Up to $0.0525 per unit or up to $787,500 (or $905,625 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) of such amount may instead be paid, at our sole discretion, to third parties not participating in this offering (but are FINRA members) that assist us in consummating our initial business combination. The company records deferred underwriting fees upon the closing of the initial public offering as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. Since the actual additional paid-in capital was reduced by the recording of the accrued deferred underwriting fees, total capitalization, as adjusted, includes the amount of the deferred underwriting fees to reflect total capitalization.  \n---|---  \n(4)| Our sponsor may loan us up to $300,000 under an unsecured promissory note to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. The “as adjusted” information gives effect to the repayment of any loans made under this note out of the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants. As of June 30, 2021, we have drawn $35,000 on the promissory note with our sponsor.  \n---|---  \n(5)| Upon the completion of our initial business combination, we will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares for cash at a per share price equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations (including, but not limited to, cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business combination.  \n---|---  \n(6)| As adjusted accumulated deficit includes transaction costs associated with warrant liability.  \n---|---  \n  \n94\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\nOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nOverview\n\nWe are a newly incorporated blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. We have not identified any potential business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any potential business combination target.\n\nWe intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our securities in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant any forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of this offering or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing or other sources.\n\nThe issuance of additional shares or equity-linked securities in connection with a business combination to the owners of the target or other investors:\n\n•| may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in this offering, which dilution would increase if the anti-dilution provisions in the Class B ordinary shares resulted in the issuance of Class A ordinary shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares;  \n---|---  \n•| may subordinate the rights of holders of Class A ordinary shares if preference shares are issued with rights senior to those afforded our Class A ordinary shares;  \n---|---  \n•| could cause a change in control if a substantial number of Class A ordinary shares are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors;  \n---|---  \n•| may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us;  \n---|---  \n•| may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our units, Class A ordinary shares and/or warrants; and  \n---|---  \n•| may not result in adjustment to the exercise price of our warrants.  \n---|---  \n  \nSimilarly, if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant debt, it could result in:\n\n•| default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;  \n---|---  \n•| acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;  \n---|---  \n•| our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt is payable on demand;  \n---|---  \n•| our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt is outstanding;  \n---|---  \n•| our inability to pay dividends on our Class A ordinary shares;  \n---|---  \n•| using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our Class A ordinary shares if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;  \n---|---  \n•| limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;  \n---|---  \n  \n95\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\n•| increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation or prevailing interest rates; and  \n---|---  \n•| limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.  \n---|---  \n  \nAs indicated in the accompanying financial statements, as of June 30, 2021, we had cash of $38,858 and deferred offering costs of approximately $233,463. Further, we expect to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our initial business combination. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to complete our initial business combination will be successful. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nResults of Operations and Known Trends or Future Events\n\nWe have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception have been organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for this offering. Following this offering, we will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial business combination. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents after this offering. There has been no significant change in our financial or trading position and no material adverse change has occurred since the date of our audited financial statements. After this offering, we expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. We expect our expenses to increase substantially after the closing of this offering.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nOur liquidity needs have been satisfied prior to the completion of this offering through the $25,000 payment from our sponsor to cover for certain expenses on behalf of us in exchange for issuance of the founder shares, and up to $300,000 in loans available from our sponsor. We estimate that the net proceeds from: (1) the sale of the units in this offering, after deducting estimated offering expenses of approximately $127,366 (after giving effect to the underwriter’s reimbursement to us) and underwriting commissions of $3,000,000 ($3,450,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) (excluding deferred underwriting commissions of $5,250,000 (or up to $6,037,500 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full)); and (2) the sale of the private placement warrants for a purchase price of $7,750,000 (or $8,650,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full), will be $154,622,634 (or $177,572,634 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full). Of this amount, $153,000,000 (or $175,950,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full), which includes $5,250,000 (or up to $6,037,500 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions, will be deposited into the trust account. The funds in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries. The remaining $1,622,634 will not be held in the trust account. In the event that our offering expenses (after giving effect to the underwriter’s reimbursement to us) exceed our estimate of $127,366, we may fund such excess with funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $127,366, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount.\n\nWe intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account (less taxes payable and deferred underwriting commissions) to complete our initial business combination. We may withdraw interest to pay our taxes, if any. Our annual income tax obligations will depend on the amount of interest and other income earned on the amounts held in the trust account. We expect the interest income earned on the amount in the trust account (if any) will be sufficient to pay our taxes. To the extent that our equity or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.\n\nPrior to the completion of our initial business combination, we expect to have available to us the $1,622,634 of proceeds held outside the trust account, as well as certain funds from loans from our sponsor.\n\nWe will use these funds primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target \n\n96\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nbusinesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a business combination, and to pay taxes to the extent the interest earned on the trust account is not sufficient to pay our taxes.\n\nWe do not believe we will need to raise additional funds following this offering in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business prior to our initial business combination, other than funds available from loans from our sponsor. However, if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial business combination. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds held in the trust account released to us. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. The terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.\n\nPrior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.\n\nWe expect our primary liquidity requirements during that period to include approximately $350,000 for legal, accounting, due diligence, travel, consulting and other expenses in connection with a search for and consummation of any business combination; $120,000 for legal and accounting fees related to regulatory reporting obligations; $70,000 for Nasdaq continued listing fees; $500,000 for Directors and Officers liability insurance premiums; and $402,634 for general working capital that will be used for miscellaneous expenses and reserves. We will also pay $10,000 per month to an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, utilities, administrative and support services provided to us ($180,000 or $210,000 in the aggregate, as applicable). In the future, we, upon consultation with the compensation committee of our board of directors, may decide to compensate our executive officers and other employees.\n\nThese amounts are estimates and may differ materially from our actual expenses. In addition, we could use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to pay commitment fees for financing, fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision (a provision designed to keep target businesses from “shopping” around for transactions with other companies or investors on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into an agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, prospective target businesses.\n\nMoreover, we may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In addition, following our initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations.\n\nControls and Procedures\n\nWe are not currently required to maintain an effective system of internal controls as defined by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We will be required to comply with the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. Only in the event that we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company would we be required to comply \n\n97\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nwith the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement. Further, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement.\n\nPrior to the closing of this offering, we have not completed an assessment, nor has our independent registered public accounting firm tested our systems, of our internal controls. We expect to assess the internal controls of our target business or businesses prior to the completion of our initial business combination and, if necessary, to implement and test additional controls as we may determine are necessary in order to state that we maintain an effective system of internal controls. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding the adequacy of internal controls. Many small and mid-sized target businesses we may consider for our initial business combination may have internal controls that need improvement in areas such as:\n\n•| staffing for financial, accounting and external reporting areas, including segregation of duties;  \n---|---  \n•| reconciliation of accounts;  \n---|---  \n•| proper recording of expenses and liabilities in the period to which they relate;  \n---|---  \n•| evidence of internal review and approval of accounting transactions;  \n---|---  \n•| documentation of processes, assumptions and conclusions underlying significant estimates; and  \n---|---  \n•| documentation of accounting policies and procedures.  \n---|---  \n  \nBecause it will take time, management involvement and perhaps outside resources to determine what internal control improvements are necessary for us to meet regulatory requirements and market expectations for our operation of a target business, we may incur significant expenses in meeting our public reporting responsibilities, particularly in the areas of designing, enhancing, or remediating internal and disclosure controls. Doing so effectively may also take longer than we expect, thus increasing our exposure to financial fraud or erroneous financial reporting.\n\nOnce our management’s report on internal controls is complete, we will retain our independent registered public accounting firm to audit and render an opinion on such report when required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The independent registered public accounting firm may identify additional issues concerning a target business’s internal controls while performing their audit of internal control over financial reporting.\n\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nThe net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants held in the trust account will be invested in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk.\n\nRelated Party Transactions\n\nSee “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements; Commitments and Contractual Obligations; Quarterly Results\n\nAs of April 9, 2021 and June 30, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations. \n\nJOBS Act\n\nThe JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We will qualify as an “emerging growth company” and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.\n\n98\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nAdditionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an “emerging growth company,” we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive Officer’s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our initial public offering or until we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” whichever is earlier.\n\n99\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nPROPOSED BUSINESS\n\nIntroduction\n\nBlue Ocean is a newly incorporated blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination. We have not identified any potential business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any potential business combination target.\n\nAlthough we may pursue our initial business combination in any business, industry or geographic location, we intend to concentrate our sourcing efforts within the high-growth consumer Internet sector in segments such as online marketplaces, education technology, advertising technology, digital media and enabling technologies and direct-to-consumer e-Commerce businesses with initial enterprise valuations between $750.0 million and $2.0 billion. We intend to seek opportunities globally, with a particular emphasis on large-population, high-growth emerging regions in Asia and Latin America, as well as in North America, including the United States. \n\nWe believe there has never been a better time to invest in the Internet & Digital Media Sector. In emerging regions, the number of people who are just accessing the mobile internet for the first time (“the next billion”) continues to grow rapidly in large-population, middle-income countries. Demand is growing among these new audiences for news, sports and e-sports, entertainment, education, services, business information and data. Online education, e-commerce and marketplace opportunities are growing rapidly in these emerging regions. The wide distribution of data analytics, software tools, artificial intelligence and social-media platforms is allowing entrepreneurs globally to optimize products for these new audience in ways not previously available.\n\nIn addition, business founders and operators in emerging regions have limited options for listing on deep or liquid exchanges in their home regions and may consider a listing on a U.S. stock exchange as an important benchmark of success. A U.S. listing can also serve as a critical catalyst for growth for these businesses while providing U.S. investors with exposure to emerging market secular growth opportunities. We believe that premise will bolster our global efforts to identify and consummate a successful business combination with a strong, fast-growing company seeking a U.S. public listing. \n\nWe believe we are well positioned to identify these opportunities. Our management, directors and advisors have deep experience operating public companies, investing globally and guiding financial transactions, including taking companies private and public. Our leadership team has extensive experience leading and managing world-class public and private market companies in our target sectors, including News Corp. (Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal), Gannett, Bloomberg, XO Group, Yodle, Graham Holdings, The Washington Post, Liberty Interactive, C.P. Group and Moscow Exchange. The group’s experience includes initial public offerings and other public capital markets and mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”) transactions, both as operators and at financial institutions including, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, UBS and LionTree. In addition, Blue Ocean’s founders include partners of North Base Media (“NBM”), a specialty venture-capital investment firm focused on growth-stage media and technology companies in global growth markets; a senior leader and a family member from the C.P. Group of Thailand, a family-controlled conglomerate with extensive interests across Asia, including telecommunications and media; and our chief executive, who has led public and private international media and digital-marketplace businesses.\n\nWe have strong support from Apollo, which we believe will be attractive to potential target businesses. Apollo has expressed to us an interest to purchase up to an aggregate of approximately $14,985,000, or 9.99%, of the units in this offering at the public offering price. Additionally, Apollo will only be able to purchase the maximum number of founder shares from our sponsor if they make equity investments in support of our initial business combination that total $25 million and do not redeem any of their Class A ordinary shares.\n\nWe believe we have the right team, strategy and market opportunity to identity, acquire and manage a “best-in-class” asset on a global scale that will deliver attractive returns to all stakeholders. \n\nThe Blue Ocean Team\n\nMembers of the Blue Ocean management team, board of directors and advisory team have worked together and known each other for decades. Our principals have served as officers and directors of large public companies as well as cutting edge private technology companies. We have seen firsthand how traditionally offline businesses can \n\n100\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nbecome obsolete and many of us have been responsible for implementing and executing major digital transformational projects at our predecessor firms. We have significant experience identifying sustainable growth opportunities, taking companies public, integrating complex M&A transactions and rolling out global go-to-market strategies. In addition to these operating roles, our sponsor Blue Ocean Sponsor LLC (our “sponsor”) also has deep investing experience through its affiliation with NBM, a specialty venture capital firm focused on investing in early and growth stage media and technology companies. NBM has invested in nearly 30 companies across the world in North America, Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East and Latin America. NBM has a global network of partners, founders and co-investors. We believe our operating and investing experience at a global scale coupled with our network of international relationships position us well to successfully effectuate Blue Ocean’s strategy. \n\nManagement Team\n\nMarcus Brauchli, Blue Ocean’s Chairman, has been co-founder and managing partner of North Base Media Ltd. since January 2014. He previously was vice president of Graham Holdings Company (NYSE: GHCO) and its predecessor, The Washington Post Co., from July 2008 until December 2013, where he developed digital opportunities for a group that included The Washington Post, the Post-Newsweek television stations, the Cable One group and Slate, a digital site.

He has lived in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Stockholm and now resides in Bethesda, Maryland. We believe Mr. Brauchli’s extensive experience leading media and global businesses, investing in digital and technology growth companies, and his substantial management experience brings important and valuable skills to our board of directors.\n\nPaul Bascobert, Blue Ocean’s Chief Executive Officer, has been an operating executive, advisor and entrepreneur in media and SaaS marketplace businesses for over 25 years. He has led multiple public and private companies through business transformations and successful exits. From August 2019 until June 2020, he was the CEO of Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) and led the company through the sale to New Media Investment Group (Gatehouse Media).

In February 1994, Mr. Bascobert co-founded Vertex Partners, a global strategy and analytics firm, and merged the company with Braun Technology Group in 1999 and helped take the company public (NASDAQ: BRNC). He led the media and telecommunications group up to the sale to Fair Isaac Corporation in 2004. He has a degree in electrical engineering from Kettering University and an M.B.A. in Finance from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. We believe Mr. Bascobert’s \n\n101\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nextensive experience in the Internet & Digital Media Sector, as well as his substantial business, leadership and management experience, including at publicly-held companies and companies seeking to go public, brings important and valuable skills to our board of directors.\n\nAnkur Manglik, Blue Ocean’s Chief Strategy Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has more than 20 years of experience in the media, communications and advertising industries across growth strategy development and execution; M&A and post-M&A integration; operational restructuring & divestitures; and equity & debt financings.

Mr. Manglik received his M.B.A. from Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management in 2004 and Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi in 1998. We believe Mr. Manglik’s extensive experience in the internet and digital media sectors, and his expertise in acquisitions and investments worldwide, brings important and valuable skills to our board of directors.\n\nSean Glodek, Blue Ocean’s Vice President focused on business development, will serve as a director of the company upon the effectiveness of this registration statement, as well as a member of Blue Ocean’s leadership team in identifying possible business combinations for Blue Ocean. Since July 2019, he has served as a Vice Chairman of CT Bright Holdings, a wholly owned investment subsidiary of C.P.

You should not rely on the historical record of NBM and our management team’s performance as indicative of our future performance. See “Risk Factors — Past performance of our founders and the other members of our management team, including investments and transactions in which they have participated and businesses with which they have been associated, may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us, and we may be unable to provide positive returns to shareholders.” For a list of our executive officers, directors, advisors and entities for which a conflict of interest may or does exist between such officers, directors, advisors and the company, please refer to “Management — Conflicts of Interest.”\n\nOur Business Strategy\n\nOur business strategy is to identify and complete a business combination that can create value for shareholders over time. We believe our experience and deep network of relationships will help us identify a significant number of appealing business combination opportunities and enable us to evaluate these opportunities. Our management team has significant experience in multiple business models, across geographies and markets. Moreover, we believe that our management team’s backgrounds will make us attractive, long-term partners to business combination targets and help the post-business combination company to thrive in the public markets. \n\nBlue Ocean’s approach to sourcing and evaluating investment opportunities will draw on our management team’s experience and what we consider to be best practices for value creation. We plan to leverage our management team’s extensive experience and expertise in a methodical process to identify best-in-class initial business combination targets.\n\nExtensive international network: Our management team has experience working for some of the world’s most respected domestic and international organizations. We have developed a highly respected network of executives and investors across diverse geographies that we believe is unique to Blue Ocean. We believe that by leveraging this network we will have access to a large pool of quality targets that will be highly differentiated from those available to other SPAC. \n\nInternational investing experience: Our management team has decades of leading and investing in businesses in international geographies. We understand the unique nuances of various regions, particularly in Asia and Latin America. We believe this expertise will enable us to be more competitive than other SPAC sponsors in these target rich geographies. \n\nPublic company leadership experience: Our management team has significant experience in building, growing, and raising capital for large public companies. We believe this experience will enable us to identify sustainable public companies and strong leadership teams with the ability to navigate them through various environments. \n\nTrack record of value creation: Our management team has experience in both rapidly scaling earlier stage companies as well as maximizing value for more mature businesses. We also have significant turnaround experience with the ability to recognize inefficiencies and pivot to more successful business models and processes. \n\nOur Process\n\nWe intend to conduct thorough due diligence to determine a prospective target’s quality and intrinsic value. That would include reviewing financial statements, legal documents, patents and proprietary technology, and historical data. We intend to meet with members of management, consult with industry experts, clients and competitors, and seek information from analysts and others familiar with the prospective target company’s business and prospects. \n\n105\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nBusiness Combination Criteria\n\nWe intend to pursue opportunities with exceptional growth companies addressing large market opportunities in highly differentiated ways. We won’t be limited by geography—either by focusing only on the U.S. or developed markets or by exploring only large emerging markets. We intend to draw on our management team’s decades of global experience in sourcing transactions, understanding and conducting due diligence on new breakthrough technologies and leadership teams in order to identify and then negotiate a corporate combination. Our management team has experience in a number of areas related to business information and data; news products; digital video and audio platforms, including podcasting; sports and gaming media; events platforms; analytics and artificial-intelligence products for media; marketplaces and direct-to-consumer platforms. Blue Ocean ultimately intends to find a target company that defines a market, is capable of significant and sustained growth, and relies on a disruptive and highly defensible strategy.\n\nValuation: We intend to target companies whose enterprise value is between $750 million and $2.0 billion. Companies of this size offer the potential for significant long-term shareholder return.\n\nHigh growth sectors: We intend to seek companies within the consumer Internet sector and adjacent industry segments, including, but not limited to, online marketplaces, education technology, advertising technology and direct-to-consumer e-Commerce businesses. \n\nDifferentiation and scale: We intend to seek to invest in a business with a clearly differentiated market strategy and a clear vision for how it will scale the business and deploy a capital infusion effectively to accelerate growth, maintain or improve margins and outlast competition.\n\nGeography: We intend to seek opportunities globally, with a particular emphasis on large-population, high-growth emerging regions in Asia and the Americas, including the United States. \n\nLarge market opportunities: We intend to seek opportunities that have traction and the potential to scale significantly into leaders in their markets. The addressable size of the market has to justify not only the valuation at the time of our initial business combination but also leave considerable runway for future upside. We intend to prioritize companies that take a “winner takes most” or “first mover advantage” approach.\n\nGrowth: We intend to seek companies that are on a sustainable growth trajectory, benefitting from the tailwinds of global Internet adoption.\n\nManagement excellence: We intend to look for teams that are creative, ambitious, visionary and data-driven. A consistent record of growth, experience overcoming challenges, and strategic vision are essential attributes.\n\nOperational maturity: We intend to seek companies which have the requisite compliance, financial controls and reporting processes in place and are ready for the regulatory requirements of a public entity.\n\nBest-in-class technology: Proprietary technology, or skillful deployment of technology and data, is essential to long-term success. So, too, is early-to-market deployment: Speed is a competitive advantage in the use of technology and data.\n\nOpportunistic Strategy: The ability to effect business transformation and achieve growth requires an adaptable, market-tested, data-driven decision-making process and an experienced team. Where a target company’s leadership may lack this experience, Blue Ocean’s team, including its board members and advisors, can bring great depth in adaptive leadership.\n\nBenefit from being public: We intend to work with management and stakeholders who aspire to have their company become a public entity and generate substantial growth. The benefits of transitioning from a private to a public entity may include broader access to debt and equity providers, liquidity for employees and potential acquisitions, and expanded branding in the marketplace.\n\nThese criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria and guidelines in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this prospectus, would be in the form of proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we would file with the SEC.\n\n106\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nMarket Overview\n\nThe global market for entertainment and media is large and growing. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers’ (“PwC”) Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2020-2024 report, worldwide entertainment and media revenue is projected to grow from $2.0 trillion in 2020 to $2.5 trillion in 2025, representing a compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of nearly 5%. According to another PWC report on the Global Entertainment and Media Outlook 2020-2024, digital revenue as a percentage of the media sector’s total revenue prior to the COVID-19 pandemic was 56.5% and is now expected to reach 64.0% by 2024. Growth is expected to be even stronger in developing economies where countries are projected to grow at nearly twice the rate of the global market. \n\nBlue Ocean’s strategy seeks to capitalize on favorable market trends and dynamics, including:\n\n•| Shift in how data is consumed. Mobile internet subscribers grew to 3.8 billion by the end of 2019 while households using fixed broadband were projected to reach 1 billion, according to the GSMA State of Mobile Internet Connectivity Report 2020. Data usage via smartphone, which first surpassed fixed broadband in 2019, is expected to triple between 2019 and 2024 while usage via broadband is expected to only double over the same time period, according to PwC. Many new businesses are becoming entirely mobile-based.  \n---|---  \n•| Proliferation of 5G. By 2025, it is expected that 45% of the world will be covered by 5G with more than 1.7 billion connected devices according to PwC. High-speed mobile data will allow consumers to access greater quantities of content, games and services. Massive network capacity will likely lower the cost of data, reducing friction in emerging markets for applications such as gaming, entertainment, music and over-the-top (“OTT”) video.  \n---|---  \n•| Emerging-market demand. Entertainment and media revenues are growing fastest in major emerging markets, where many users are just getting access to affordable data on their phones. We believe the growth patterns established in the U.S. and China are likely to repeat in other major markets as mobile-internet penetration increases.  \n---|---  \n•| Fast growing segment. Among the fastest growing segments within the overall entertainment and media sector are expected to be virtual reality, OTT video, video games and esports, internet advertising and podcasts.   \n---|---  \n  \nWe believe that this is the right time to pursue our strategy. The stay at home orders and remote work and school environment created by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic accelerated digital trends that were already under way. According to the Interactive Advertising Bureau, traditional advertising is now much more focused on digital platforms and publishers. Digital subscriptions rose sharply at media companies, with the media-subscription and data company Piano reporting a 93% increase in new media subscription starts globally during April 2020. Among 123 large subscription-based sites, Piano reported that 57.8% experienced “major increases” in active subscriptions during 2020. People are spending more time at home with their smartphones and apps, according to Nielsen, and Americans spent approximately an hour more online each day in 2020 compared to 2018. E-commerce transactions in the U.S. during 2020 grew by 44%, the equivalent of the four previous years’ growth. The number of advertisers using Facebook’s platform continues to grow, with a 12% increase in the total number of ads delivered during 2020, when COVID-19 was at its worst. The top 100 advertisers on Facebook now account for only 16% of revenues, as more and more small and medium size businesses start to use the platform. Streaming entertainment proliferated, with U.S. consumers able to choose from among nearly 300 over-the-top services, according to Parks Associates. More than half of U.S. adults now pay for news, and another 26% are open to it, according to the American Press Institute. We believe global trends very much mirror those in the U.S.\n\nOther Internet-driven segments also have shown resilience or significant growth. According to venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which started a ranking of the largest consumer-facing marketplace businesses just before COVID-19 struck, a number of categories were “supercharged,” including online education, celebrity engagement and grocery delivery. Some marketplace businesses suffered—ticketing, for instance—but that led to others that flourished, like those for live streaming events. In Asia, a new form of digital commerce spread from China to Southeast Asia, Live Commerce, in which individuals use social-media platforms to promote and sell products to their followers. Retail sales driven by live streaming on China’s “Singles Day” (November 11) in 2020 was nearly double a year earlier, according to Alibaba’s Taobao platform, and approximately 300 million viewers tapped into live-shopping channels between November 1 and 11, 2020.\n\n107\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nInitial Business Combination\n\nWe will have until 18 months from the closing of this offering to consummate an initial business combination, with an automatic three-month extension if we have signed a definitive agreement with respect to an initial business combination within such 18-month period. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 18 months, we may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by an additional three months (for a total of up to 21 months to complete a business combination) without submitting such proposed extensions to our shareholders for approval or offering our public shareholders redemption rights in connection therewith. Pursuant to the terms of our memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement to be entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on the date of this prospectus, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon ten days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account $1,500,000, or up to $1,725,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full ($0.10 per unit in either case) on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for such three-month extension. Any such payments would be made in the form of a loan. Any such loan will be non-interest bearing and payable upon the consummation of our initial business combination. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amount out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. If we do not complete our initial business combination, we will not repay such loan. Furthermore, the letter agreement with our initial shareholders contains a provision pursuant to which our sponsor has agreed to waive its right to be repaid for such loan out of the funds held in the trust account in the event that we do not complete our initial business combination. Our sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. Up to $1,500,000 of the loans made by our sponsor, our officers and directors, or their affiliates to us prior to or in connection with our initial business combination (including any loan made to extend our time period for consummating our initial business combination) may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender.\n\nNasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make such independent determination of fair market value, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board of directors determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. As any such opinion, if obtained, would only state that the fair market value meets the 80% of net assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of the target or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required by Schedule 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we will file with the SEC in connection with our initial business combination will include such opinion.\n\nWe anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act.\n\nEven if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business \n\n108\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\ncombination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.\n\nOur Acquisition Process\n\nWe are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination or subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, founders, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination or, subject to certain exceptions, subsequent material transactions with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor or any of our founders, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such initial business combination or transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view.\n\nMembers of our management team and our directors will directly or indirectly own our ordinary shares and/or private placement warrants following this offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.\n\nIn addition, certain of our founders, officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary and contractual duties to other entities, pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity subject to his or her fiduciary duty. As a result, if any of our founders, officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he, she or it has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, then, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, or contractual obligations, he, she or it will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If these other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. However, we do not believe that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our founders, officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other.\n\nFurther, our sponsor, founders, officers and directors and any of their respective affiliates may sponsor or form, or in the case of individuals, serve as director or officer of, other special purpose acquisition companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an initial business combination. Our founders, officers and directors, are not required to commit any \n\n109\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nspecified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.\n\nPrior to the date of this prospectus, we will file a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we will be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.\n\nStatus as a Public Company\n\nWe believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to a traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our Class A ordinary shares (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A ordinary shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than a typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.\n\nFurthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriter’s ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.\n\nWhile we believe that our structure and our management team’s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a special purpose acquisition company, including our lack of an operating history and our potential need to seek shareholder approval of a proposed initial business combination, negatively.\n\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.\n\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.\n\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least \n\n110\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\n$1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. \n\nAdditionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year or the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.\n\nFinancial Position\n\nWith funds available for a business combination initially in the amount of $149,372,634 assuming no redemptions and after payment of $5,250,000 of deferred underwriting fees (or $171,535,134 assuming no redemptions and after payment of $6,037,500 of deferred underwriting fees if the underwriter’s option to purchase additional units is exercised in full), in each case, after estimated offering expenses of $127,366 (after giving effect to the underwriter’s reimbursement to us and prior to any post-IPO working capital expenses), we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio.\n\nBecause we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.\n\nEffecting Our Initial Business Combination\n\nGeneral\n\nWe are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following this offering. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of this offering, the sale of the private placement warrants, our equity, debt or a combination of these or other sources as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination.\n\nWe may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.\n\nIf our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-business combination company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.\n\nWe have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, engaged in any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target with respect to an initial business combination with us. Additionally, we have not engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate, to conduct any research or take any measures, directly or indirectly, to locate or contact a target business, other than our officers and directors. Accordingly, there is no current basis for investors in this offering to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination.\n\nAlthough our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may \n\n111\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nencounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely affect a target business.\n\nWe may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. We are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise.\n\nSources of Target Businesses\n\nOur process of identifying acquisition targets will leverage our management team’s unique industry experiences, proven deal sourcing capabilities and broad and deep network of relationships, including executives and management teams, private equity groups and other institutional investors, large business enterprises, lenders, investment bankers and other investment market participants, consultants, attorneys and accountants, which we believe should provide us with a number of business combination opportunities. We expect that the collective experience, capability and network our founders, directors and officers, combined with their individual and collective reputations in the investment community, will help to create prospective business combination opportunities.\n\nIn addition, we anticipate that target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since some of these sources will have read this prospectus and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates of which they become aware through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors.\n\nWhile we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of a finder’s fee is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation by us (other than as outlined below) for services rendered prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, commencing on the date of this prospectus, we will pay $10,000 per month to an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, secretarial and administrative services and our sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating, negotiating and completing an initial business combination. In the future, we, upon consultation with the compensation committee of our board of directors, may decide to compensate our executive officers and other employees. Any such payments prior to our initial business combination will be made from funds held outside the trust account.\n\nWe are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination or subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, founders, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination or, subject to certain exceptions, subsequent material transactions with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor or any of our founders, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such initial business combination or transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view. \n\n112\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nEach of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities, and other entities that are affiliates of our sponsor, pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. See “Management — Conflicts of Interest.”\n\nEvaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination\n\nIn evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews and inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operation, legal and other information that will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction.\n\nThe time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.\n\nIn addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor.\n\nLack of Business Diversification\n\nFor an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments.\n\nFurther, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be:\n\n•| solely dependent upon the performance of a single business, property or asset; or  \n---|---  \n•| dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.  \n---|---  \n  \nThis lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial business combination.\n\nLimited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team\n\nAlthough we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.\n\n113\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nWe cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.\n\nFollowing a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.\n\nShareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination\n\nWe may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other reasons.\n\nType of Transaction| ​| ​| Whether Shareholder Approval is Required  \n---|---|---|---  \nPurchase of assets| ​| ​| No  \nPurchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company| ​| ​| No  \nMerger of target into a subsidiary of the company| ​| ​| No  \nMerger of the company with a target| ​| ​| Yes  \n  \nUnder Nasdaq’s listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:\n\n•| we issue Class A ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our Class A ordinary shares then outstanding (other than in a public offering);  \n---|---  \n•| any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5% or more; or  \n---|---  \n  \nthe issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.\n\nThe decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and other reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\n•| the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine shareholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek shareholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company;  \n---|---  \n•| the expected cost of holding a shareholder vote;  \n---|---  \n•| the risk that the shareholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;  \n---|---  \n•| other time and budget constraints of the company; and  \n---|---  \n•| additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to shareholders.  \n---|---  \n•| ability to extend time to complete business combination.  \n---|---  \n  \nPermitted Purchases and Other Transactions with Respect to Our Securities\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business \n\n114\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\ncombination. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or any of their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act.\n\nIn the event that our sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our initial business combination, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our initial business combination. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules.\n\nThe purpose of any such transaction could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination, (ii) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination or (iii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such transactions with respect to our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.\n\nIn addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.\n\nOur sponsor, initial shareholders, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our sponsor, initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated transactions by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the case of Class A ordinary shares) following our mailing of tender offer or proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private transaction, they would identify and contact potential selling or redeeming shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such shareholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the general meeting related to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will be restricted from purchasing shares if such purchases do not comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.\n\nOur sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. We expect any such purchases would be reported by such person pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.\n\nRedemption Rights for Public Shareholders Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination\n\nWe will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.20 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem \n\n115\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\ntheir shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriter. The redemption right will include the requirement that any beneficial owner on whose behalf a redemption right is being exercised must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Further, subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we will not proceed with redeeming our public shares, even if a public shareholder has properly elected to redeem its shares, if a business combination does not close. Our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. The other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our sponsor with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after this offering.\n\nLimitations on Redemptions\n\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon completion of our initial business combination (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). However, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination.\n\nManner of Conducting Redemptions\n\nWe will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Under Nasdaq rules, asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would typically require shareholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with Nasdaq rules.\n\nIf we held a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:\n\n•| conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and  \n---|---  \n•| file proxy materials with the SEC.  \n---|---  \n  \nIn the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we receive an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. In such case, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial business \n\n116\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\ncombination. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ founder shares, we would need 5,625,001, or 37.5% (assuming all outstanding shares are voted and the underwriter’s over-allotment option is not exercised) of the 15,000,000 public shares sold in this offering to be voted in favor of a transaction, in order to have such initial business combination approved. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all. In addition, our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (a) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity.\n\nIf we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:\n\n•| conduct purchases pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and  \n---|---  \n•| file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.  \n---|---  \n  \nUpon the public announcement of our initial business combination, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase Class A ordinary shares in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.\n\nIn the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination.\n\nLimitation on Redemption Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to Excess Shares, without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the Class A ordinary shares that are part of the units sold in this offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the Class A ordinary shares that are part of the units sold in this offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.\n\n117\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nHowever, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.\n\nTendering Share Certificates in Connection With a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights\n\nIn connection with any vote held to approve a proposed business combination, public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” will be required to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case no later than two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that any beneficial owner on whose behalf a redemption right is being exercised must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares.\n\nAccordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.\n\nThere is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.\n\nIn addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote, a public shareholder seeking redemption of its public shares must also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent at least two business days prior to the vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included.\n\nAny request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.\n\nIf our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.\n\nIf our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering.\n\nRedemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination\n\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that we will have only 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering to complete our initial business combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination within such 18-month (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) time period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as \n\n118\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nshareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case, to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the 18-month (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) time period. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law.\n\nOur initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering. However, if our initial shareholders or management team acquire public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted 18-month (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) time period.\n\nOur sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees will have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (i) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon completion of our initial business combination (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person.\n\nWe expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the $1,622,634 of proceeds held outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. We will depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the trust account to provide us with additional cash to pay any tax obligations that we may owe. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.\n\nIf we were to expend all of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be $10.20. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be less than $10.20. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.\n\nAlthough we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (except our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to \n\n119\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nfraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will consider whether competitive alternatives are reasonably available to the company, and will only enter into an agreement with such third party if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be in the best interests of the company under the circumstances. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. The underwriter of this offering will not execute an agreement with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.20 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.20 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.\n\nIn the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.20 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.20 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.20 per public share.\n\nWe will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to $1,622,634 from the proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our trust account received by any such shareholder. In the event that our offering expenses (after giving effect to the underwriter’s reimbursement to us) exceed our estimate of $127,366, we may fund such excess with funds from the \n\n120\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nfunds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $127,366, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount.\n\nIf we file a bankruptcy or winding up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.20 per public share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy or winding up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy or insolvency laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.\n\nOur public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (a) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote.\n\nComparison of Redemption or Purchase Prices in Connection With Our Initial Business Combination and If We Fail to Complete Our Initial Business Combination.\n\nThe following table compares the redemptions and other permitted purchases of public shares that may take place in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and if we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering.\n\n​| ​| Redemptions in Connection With Our Initial Business Combination| ​| ​| Other Permitted Purchases of Public Shares by Our Affiliates| ​| ​| Redemptions If We Fail to Complete an Initial Business Combination  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nCalculation of redemption price| ​| ​| Redemptions at the time of our initial business combination may be made pursuant to a tender offer or in connection with a shareholder vote.

There is no limit to the prices that our initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may pay in these transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules.| ​| ​| amount, then on deposit in the trust account (which is initially anticipated to be $10.20 per share), including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares.  \nImpact to remaining shareholders| ​| ​| The redemptions in connection with our initial business combination will reduce the book value per share for our remaining shareholders, who will bear the burden of the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable.| ​| ​| If the permitted purchases described above are made, there would be no impact to our remaining shareholders because the purchase price would not be paid by us.| ​| ​| The redemption of our public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination will reduce the book value per share for the shares held by our initial shareholders, who will be our only remaining shareholders after such redemptions.  \n  \nComparison of This Offering to Those of Blank Check Companies Subject to Rule 419\n\nThe following table compares the terms of this offering to the terms of an offering by a blank check company subject to the provisions of Rule 419. This comparison assumes that the gross proceeds, underwriting commissions and underwriting expenses of our offering would be identical to those of an offering undertaken by a company subject to Rule 419, and that the underwriter will not exercise its over-allotment option. None of the provisions of Rule 419 apply to our offering.\n\n122\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\n​| ​| Terms of Our Offering| ​| ​| Terms Under a Rule 419 Offering  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nEscrow of offering proceeds| ​| ​| $153,000,000 of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants will be deposited into a trust account located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee.| ​| ​| Approximately $127,575,000 of the offering proceeds would be required to be deposited into either an escrow account with an insured depositary institution or in a separate bank account established by a broker-dealer in which the broker-dealer acts as trustee for persons having the beneficial interests in the account.  \nInvestment of net proceeds| ​| ​| $153,000,000 of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants held in trust will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.| ​| ​| Proceeds could be invested only in specified securities such as a money market fund meeting conditions of the Investment Company Act or in securities that are direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to principal or interest by, the United States.  \nReceipt of interest on escrowed funds| ​| ​| Interest income (if any) on proceeds from the trust account to be paid to shareholders is reduced by (i) any income taxes paid or payable and (ii) in the event of our liquidation for failure to complete our initial business combination within the allotted time, up to $100,000 of net interest that may be released to us should we have no or insufficient working capital to fund the costs and expenses of our dissolution and liquidation.| ​| ​| Interest income on funds in escrow account would be held for the sole benefit of investors, unless and only after the funds held in escrow were released to us in connection with our completion of a business combination.  \nLimitation on fair value or net assets of target business| ​| ​| Nasdaq listing rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination.| ​| ​| The fair value or net assets of a target business must represent at least 80% of the maximum offering proceeds.  \nTrading of securities issued| ​| ​| The units are expected to begin trading on or promptly after the date of this prospectus.

If the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised following the initial filing of such Current Report on Form 8-K, a second or amended Current Report on Form 8-K will be filed to provide updated financial information to reflect the exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option. The units will automatically separate into their component parts and will not be traded after completion of our initial business combination.| ​| ​  \nExercise of the warrants| ​| ​| The warrants cannot be exercised until the later of 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination and 12 months from the closing of this offering.| ​| ​| The warrants could be exercised prior to the completion of a business combination, but securities received and cash paid in connection with the exercise would be deposited in the escrow or trust account.  \nElection to remain an investor| ​| ​| We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares for cash at a per share price equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest (net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, upon the completion of our initial business combination, subject to the limitations described herein.

Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights.| ​| ​| company would contact such shareholder to arrange for delivery of its share certificates to verify ownership.  \nLimitation on redemption rights of shareholders holding more than 15% of the Class A ordinary shares that are part of the units sold in this offering if we hold a shareholder vote| ​| ​| If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to Excess Shares, without our consent. However, we would not restrict our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.| ​| ​| Many blank check companies provide no restrictions on the ability of shareholders to redeem shares based on the number of shares held by such shareholders in connection with an initial business combination.  \n  \n127\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nCompetition\n\nWe expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other special purpose acquisition companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries.\n\nMany of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, we are obligated to offer holders of our public shares the right to redeem their shares for cash at the time of our initial business combination in conjunction with a shareholder vote or via a tender offer. Target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination.\n\nConflict of Interest\n\nOur management team, in their capacities as directors, officers or employees of our sponsor or its affiliates or in their other endeavors, may choose to present potential business combinations to the related entities described above, current or future entities affiliated with or managed by our sponsor, or third parties, before they present such opportunities to us. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other. For more information, see the section entitled “ Management — Conflicts of Interest.”\n\nIn addition, our officers or directors may be investors, or have other direct or indirect interests, in a business with which we may enter into a business combination agreement and/or in certain funds or other persons that may purchase shares in this offering or that may otherwise purchase our Class A ordinary shares in the public market.\n\nEach of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our directors or officers becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may need to honor these fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity. See “Risk Factors — Certain of our officers and directors are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us, including other blank check companies, and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time and determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.”\n\nWe do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors or officers will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.\n\nIndemnity\n\nIn order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.20 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.20 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed \n\n128\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\na waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.\n\nFacilities\n\nWe currently maintain our executive offices at 2 Wisconsin Circle, 7th Floor, Chevy Chase, MD 20815. The cost for our use of this space is included in the $10,000 per month fee we will pay to an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, administrative and support services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.\n\nEmployees\n\nWe currently have four executive officers: Marcus Brauchli, our Chairman, Paul Bascobert, Chief Executive Officer, Ankur Manglik, our Chief Strategy Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and Sean Glodek, our Vice President. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.\n\nPeriodic Reporting and Financial Information\n\nWe will register our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.\n\nWe will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, sent to shareholders. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.\n\nWe will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.\n\nPrior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we will file a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we will be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.\n\n129\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nWe are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act. As an exempted company, we have applied for and have received, a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.\n\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.\n\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.\n\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.\n\nAdditionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year or the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nThere is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such.\n\n130\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nExecutive Officers, Directors and Director Nominees\n\nOur executive officers, directors and director nominees are as follows:\n\nName| ​| ​| Age| ​| ​| Position  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nMarcus Brauchli| ​| ​| 59| ​| ​| Chairman  \nPaul Bascobert| ​| ​| 57| ​| ​| Chief Executive Officer and Director   \nAnkur Manglik | ​| ​| 45 | ​| ​| Chief Strategy Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Director  \nSean Glodek| ​| ​| 50| ​| ​| Vice President and Director Nominee(*)   \nNorman Pearlstine| ​| ​| 78| ​| ​| Independent Director Nominee(*)  \nJoel Motley| ​| ​| 69| ​| ​| Independent Director Nominee(*)  \nMatt Goldberg| ​| ​| 50| ​| ​| Independent Director Nominee(*)  \nPriscilla Han| ​| ​| 37| ​| ​| Independent Director Nominee(*)  \nDale Mathias| ​| ​| 69| ​| ​| Independent Director Nominee(*)  \n(*)| This individual will occupy the position of director on the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.   \n---|---  \n  \nExecutive Officers, Directors and Director Nominees\n\nMarcus Brauchli, Blue Ocean’s Chairman, has been co-founder and managing partner of North Base Media Ltd. since January 2014.

He has a degree in electrical engineering from Kettering University and an M.B.A. in Finance from the Wharton School Pennsylvania and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. We believe Mr. Bascobert’s extensive experience in the Internet & Digital Media Sector, as well as his substantial business, leadership and management experience, including at publicly-held companies and companies seeking to go public, brings important and valuable skills to our board of directors.\n\nAnkur Manglik, Blue Ocean’s Chief Strategy Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has more than 20 years of experience in the media, communications and advertising industries across growth strategy development and execution; M&A and post-M&A integration; operational restructuring & divestitures; and equity & debt financings.

Mr. Dube received his M.B.A. from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.\n\nNumber and Terms of Office of Officers and Directors\n\nWe intend to have nine directors upon the effectiveness of this registration statement. Our board of directors will be divided into three classes, with only one class of directors being appointed in each year, and with each class (except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual general meeting) serving a three-year term. In accordance with Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual general meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on Nasdaq. The term of office of the first class of directors, consisting of Dale Mathias, Norman Pearlstine and Sean Glodek, will expire at our first annual general meeting. The term of office of the second class of directors, consisting of Priscilla Han, Joel Motley and Matt Goldberg, will expire at our second annual general meeting. The term of office of the third class of directors, consisting of Marcus Brauchli, Paul Bascobert and Ankur Manglik, will expire at our third annual general meeting.\n\nPrior to the completion of an initial business combination, any vacancy on the board of directors may be filled by a nominee chosen by holders of a majority of our founder shares. In addition, prior to the completion of an initial business combination, holders of a majority of our founder shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason.\n\nOur officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of directors will be authorized to appoint persons to the offices as set forth in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association as it deems appropriate. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that our officers may consist of one or more chairmen of the board, chief executive officers, a president, chief financial officer, vice presidents, secretary, treasurer and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors.\n\n135\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nDirector Independence\n\nNasdaq listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors be independent. An “independent director” is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the company’s board of directors, would interfere with the director’s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. We expect that our board of directors will determine that Norman Pearlstine, Joel Motley, Matt Goldberg, Priscilla Han, and Dale Mathias are “independent directors” as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.\n\nExecutive Officer and Director Compensation\n\nNone of our executive officers or directors has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. In addition, our sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating, negotiating and completing an initial business combination. In the future, we, upon consultation with the compensation committee of our board of directors, may decide to compensate our executive officers and other employees. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or our or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial business combination will be made using funds held outside the trust account. Other than quarterly audit committee review of such reimbursements, we do not expect to have any additional controls in place governing our reimbursement payments to our directors and executive officers for their out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating, negotiating and completing an initial business combination. Other than these payments and reimbursements, no compensation of any kind, including finder’s and consulting fees, will be paid by the company to our sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, prior to completion of our initial business combination.\n\nAfter the completion of our initial business combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting or management fees from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to shareholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation materials or tender offer materials furnished to our shareholders in connection with a proposed business combination. We have not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our directors or members of management. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed business combination, because the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining executive officer and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our executive officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors.\n\nWe do not intend to take any action to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the consummation of our initial business combination, although it is possible that some or all of our executive officers and directors may remain directors or negotiate employment or consulting arrangements to remain with us after our initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence our management’s motivation in identifying or selecting a target business but we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after the consummation of our initial business combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business combination. We are not party to any agreements with our executive officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment.\n\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\n\nOur board of directors will have two standing committees: an audit committee and a compensation committee. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, Nasdaq rules and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors, and Nasdaq rules require that the compensation committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. Each committee will operate under a charter that will be approved by our board of directors and will have the composition and responsibilities described below. The form of each committee’s charter is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part.\n\n136\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nAudit Committee\n\nUpon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we will establish an audit committee of the board of directors. Joel Motley, Matt Goldberg and Priscilla Han will serve as members of our audit committee. Under Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have three members of the audit committee, all of whom must be independent, subject to the exception described below. Joel Motley, Matt Goldberg and Priscilla Han are independent.\n\nJoel Motley will serve as the Chairman of the audit committee. Each member of the audit committee is financially literate, and our board of directors has determined that Joel Motley qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” as defined in applicable SEC rules. The primary purposes of our audit committee are to assist the board’s oversight of:\n\n•| the integrity of our financial statements;  \n---|---  \n•| our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;  \n---|---  \n•| the qualifications, engagement, compensation, independence and performance of our independent registered public accounting firm;  \n---|---  \n•| our process relating to risk management and the conduct and systems of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures; and  \n---|---  \n•| the performance of our internal audit function.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe audit committee will be governed by a charter that complies with Nasdaq rules.\n\nCompensation Committee\n\nUpon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we will establish a compensation committee of our board of directors. The members of our compensation committee will be Matt Goldberg and Dale Mathias, with Matt Goldberg serving as chairman of the compensation committee. Matt Goldberg and Dale Mathias are independent.\n\nThe primary purposes of our compensation committee are to assist the board in overseeing our management compensation policies and practices, including:\n\n•| determining and approving the compensation of our executive officers; and  \n---|---  \n•| reviewing and approving incentive compensation and equity compensation policies and programs.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe charter will also provide that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC.\n\nThe compensation committee will be governed by a charter that complies with Nasdaq rules.\n\nDirector Nominations\n\nWe do not have a standing nominating committee though we intend to form a corporate governance and nominating committee as and when required to do so by law or Nasdaq rules. In accordance with Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq rules, a majority of the independent directors may recommend a director nominee for selection by the board of directors. The board of directors believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily carry out the responsibility of properly selecting or approving director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee. The directors who will participate in the consideration and recommendation of director nominees are Norman Pearlstine, Joel Motley, Matt Goldberg, Priscilla Han and Dale Mathias. In accordance with Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq rules, all such directors are independent. As there is no standing nominating committee, we do not have a nominating committee charter in place.\n\n137\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nWe have not formally established any specific minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, our board of directors considers educational background, diversity of professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom and the ability to represent the best interests of our shareholders.\n\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\n\nNone of our executive officers currently serves, and in the past year has not served, as a member of the compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our board of directors.\n\nCode of Ethics\n\nUpon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we will have adopted a code of ethics and business conduct (our “Code of Ethics”) applicable to our directors, officers and employees. A copy of the Code of Ethics will be provided without charge upon request from us and will be posted on our website. We intend to disclose any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our Code of Ethics in a Current Report on Form 8-K.\n\nConflicts of Interest\n\nUnder Cayman Islands law, directors and officers owe the following fiduciary duties:\n\n•| duty to act in good faith in what the director or officer believes to be in the best interests of the company as a whole;  \n---|---  \n•| duty to exercise powers for the purposes for which those powers were conferred and not for a collateral purpose;  \n---|---  \n•| directors should not improperly fetter the exercise of future discretion;  \n---|---  \n•| duty to exercise powers fairly as between different sections of shareholders;  \n---|---  \n•| duty not to put themselves in a position in which there is a conflict between their duty to the company and their personal interests; and  \n---|---  \n•| duty to exercise independent judgment.  \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition to the above, directors also owe a duty of care which is not fiduciary in nature. This duty has been defined as a requirement to act as a reasonably diligent person having both the general knowledge, skill and experience that may reasonably be expected of a person carrying out the same functions as are carried out by that director in relation to the company and the general knowledge skill and experience of that director.\n\nAs set out above, directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position of conflict and this includes a duty not to engage in self-dealing, or to otherwise benefit as a result of their position. However, in some instances what would otherwise be a breach of this duty can be forgiven and/or authorized in advance by the shareholders provided that there is full disclosure by the directors. This can be done by way of permission granted in the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or alternatively by shareholder approval at general meetings.\n\nEach of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary and contractual duties to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity subject to his or her fiduciary duties. As a result, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he, she or it has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, then, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, or contractual obligations, he, she or it will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If these other entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. However, we do not believe that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our founders, officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging \n\n138\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\ndirectly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other.\n\nIn addition, our sponsor, officers, directors and any of their respective affiliates may sponsor or form, or, in the case of individuals, serve as a director or officer of, other blank check companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an initial business combination. Our officers and directors, are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. See “Risk Factors — Certain of our officers and directors are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us, including other blank check companies, and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time and determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.”\n\n139\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nBelow is a table summarizing the entities to which our executive officers and director nominees have fiduciary duties or contractual obligations as of the date of this prospectus:\n\nIndividual| ​| ​| Entity| ​| ​| Entity’s Business| ​| ​| Affiliation  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nMarcus Brauchli| ​| ​| North Base Media| ​| ​| Venture Capital| ​| ​| Managing Partner  \n​| ​| Gremi Media S.A.| ​| ​| Media| ​| ​| Director  \n​| ​| The News Lens| ​| ​| Media| ​| ​| Director  \n​| ​| Capital Digital, S.A.| ​| ​| Media| ​| ​| Director  \n​| ​| 5G Edge Acquisition Corp.| ​| ​| Technology, Media, and Telecommunications| ​| ​| Advisor  \n​| ​| Datami Inc.| ​| ​| Business Software| ​| ​| Advisor  \n​| ​| Ridgely-Walsh LLC| ​| ​| Communications| ​| ​| Senior Advisor  \n​| ​| Arthur F.

We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Each of our executive officers is engaged in several other business endeavors for which he may be entitled to substantial compensation, and our executive officers are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours per week to our affairs.  \n---|---  \n•| Our sponsor purchased founder shares prior to the date of this prospectus and will purchase private placement warrants in a transaction that will close simultaneously with the closing of this offering. Our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. The other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our sponsor with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after this offering. Additionally, our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their rights to   \n---|---  \n  \n140\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nliquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. If we do not complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, the private placement warrants will expire worthless. Our initial shareholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares until the earlier to occur of: (i) one year after the completion of our initial business combination; and (ii) subsequent to our initial business combination (x) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property or (y) if the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and other similar transactions) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination (except as described in the section entitled “Principal Shareholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants”). The private placement warrants will not be transferable until 30 days following the completion of our initial business combination. Because each of our executive officers and director nominees will own ordinary shares or warrants directly or indirectly, they may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination.\n\n•| Our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination or subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, founders, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination or, subject to certain exceptions, subsequent material transactions with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor or any of our founders, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such initial business combination or transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view. Furthermore, in no event will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, be paid by the company any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation (other than as outlined below) for services rendered prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination. However, commencing on the date of this prospectus, we will pay $10,000 per month to an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, secretarial and administrative services and our sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating, negotiating and completing an initial business combination. In the future, we, upon consultation with the compensation committee of our board of directors, may decide to compensate our executive officers and other employees. Any such payments prior to our initial business combination will be made from funds held outside the trust account.\n\nWe cannot assure you that any of the above mentioned conflicts will be resolved in our favor.\n\nIn addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. In the event that we submit our initial business combination to our public shareholders for a vote, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares, and they and the other members of our management team have agreed to vote any shares purchased during or after the offering, in favor of our initial business combination.\n\nLimitation on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors\n\nCayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against willful default, willful neglect, civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide for indemnification of our officers and directors to the maximum extent permitted by law, including for any liability incurred in their capacities as such, except through their own actual fraud, willful default or willful neglect. We will enter into agreements with our directors and officers to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. We expect to purchase a policy of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that insures our \n\n141\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nofficers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors.\n\nOur officers and directors have agreed to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the trust account, and have agreed to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any services provided to us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason whatsoever (except to the extent they are entitled to funds from the trust account due to their ownership of public shares). Accordingly, any indemnification provided will only be able to be satisfied by us if (i) we have sufficient funds outside of the trust account or (ii) we consummate an initial business combination.\n\nWe believe that these provisions, the insurance and the indemnity agreements are necessary to attract and retain talented and experienced officers and directors.\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.\n\n142\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nPRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS\n\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our ordinary shares as of the date of this prospectus, and as adjusted to reflect the sale of our Class A ordinary shares included in the units offered by this prospectus, and assuming no purchase of units in this offering, by:\n\n•| each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our issued outstanding ordinary shares;  \n---|---  \n•| each of our executive officers, directors and director nominees; and  \n---|---  \n•| all our executive officers and directors as a group.  \n---|---  \n  \nUnless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all of our ordinary shares beneficially owned by them. The following table does not reflect record or beneficial ownership of the private placement warrants as these warrants are not exercisable within 60 days of the date of this prospectus.\n\nOn April 7, 2021, we issued to our sponsor an aggregate of 4,312,500 founder shares in exchange for a payment of $25,000 from our sponsor to cover for certain expenses on behalf of us, or approximately $0.006 per share. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by the sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The per share price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash the sponsor paid for the founder shares by the number of founder shares issued. At or prior to this offering, our sponsor will transfer 30,000 founder shares to each of Joel Motley, Matt Goldberg, and Priscilla Han, and 25,000 founder shares to each of Norman Pearlstine and Dale Mathias, our independent director nominees at the same price originally paid for such shares. In addition, at or prior to this offering, our sponsor will transfer an aggregate of 100,000 founder shares to six advisors at the same price as originally paid for such shares. Up to 562,500 founder shares will be surrendered to us by our sponsor for no consideration after the closing of this offering depending on the extent to which the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised. The total number of Class B ordinary shares outstanding after this offering and the expiration of the underwriter’s over-allotment option will equal 20% of the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares outstanding at such time. The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder thereof, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment, as described in this prospectus. If we increase or decrease the size of this offering, we will effect a share capitalization or a share repurchase or redemption or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable, with respect to our Class B ordinary shares immediately prior to the consummation of this offering in such amount as to maintain the number of founder shares, on an as-converted basis, at 20% of the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares outstanding at such time (assuming the underwriter exercises its over-allotment option in full). The post-offering percentages in the following table assume that the underwriter does not exercise its over-allotment option and that our sponsor has surrendered to us for no consideration 562,500 founder shares.\n\n​| ​| Number of Shares Owned(2)| ​| ​| Approximate Percentage of Outstanding Ordinary Shares  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nName and Address of Beneficial Owner(1)| ​| ​| Before Offering| ​| ​| After Offering| ​| ​| Before Offering| ​| ​| After Offering  \nBlue Ocean Sponsor LLC(3)| ​| ​| 4,072,500| ​| ​| 3,510,000| ​| ​| 94.4%| ​| ​| 18.7%  \nMarcus Brauchli(3)| ​| ​| 4,072,500| ​| ​| 3,510,000| ​| ​| 94.4%| ​| ​| 18.7%  \nPaul Bascobert(3)| ​| ​| 4,072,500| ​| ​| 3,510,000| ​| ​| 94.4%| ​| ​| 18.7%  \nAnkur Manglik| ​| ​| —| ​| ​| —| ​| ​| *| ​| ​| *  \nSean Glodek| ​| ​| —| ​| ​| —| ​| ​| *| ​| ​| *  \nNorman Pearlstine| ​| ​| 25,000| ​| ​| 25,000| ​| ​| *| ​| ​| *  \nJoel Motley| ​| ​| 30,000| ​| ​| 30,000| ​| ​| *| ​| ​| *  \nMatt Goldberg| ​| ​| 30,000| ​| ​| 30,000| ​| ​| *| ​| ​| *  \nPriscilla Han| ​| ​| 30,000| ​| ​| 30,000| ​| ​| *| ​| ​| *  \nDale Mathias| ​| ​| 25,000| ​| ​| 25,000| ​| ​| *| ​| ​| *  \nAll officers, directors and director nominees as a group (9 individuals)| ​| ​| 4,212,500| ​| ​| 3,650,000| ​| ​| 97.0%| ​| ​| 19.0%  \n*| Less than one percent.  \n---|---  \n(1)| Unless otherwise noted, the business address of each of our shareholders is 2 Wisconsin Circle, 7th Floor, Chevy Chase, MD 20815.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Interests shown consist solely of founder shares, classified as Class B ordinary shares.

Each of Marcus Brauchli and Paul Bascobert are the managers of Blue Ocean Sponsor LLC. As such, each of Marcus Brauchli and Paul Bascobert may be deemed to have beneficial ownership of the Class B ordinary shares held directly by Blue Ocean Sponsor LLC. Each of Marcus Brauchli and Paul Bascobert disclaim beneficial ownership over any securities owned by our sponsor in which he does not have any pecuniary interest.  \n---|---  \n(4)| Includes up to 562,500 founder shares that will be surrendered to us for no consideration by our sponsor and Apollo depending on the extent to which the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised.  \n---|---  \n(5)| Does not include any shares indirectly owned by this individual as a result of his or her partnership interest in our sponsor or its affiliates.  \n---|---  \n  \nImmediately after this offering and the expiration of the underwriter’s over-allotment option, our initial shareholders will beneficially own 20% of the then outstanding ordinary shares (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering) and will have the right to appoint all of our directors prior to our initial business combination. Holders of our public shares will not have the right to appoint any directors to our board of directors prior to our initial business combination. Because of this ownership block, our initial shareholders may be able to effectively influence the outcome of all other matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and approval of significant corporate transactions including our initial business combination.\n\nApollo has expressed to us an interest to purchase an aggregate of approximately $14,985,000 or approximately 9.99%, of the units in this offering at the public offering price, and we have agreed to direct the underwriter to sell to Apollo such amount of units, subject to our satisfying the Nasdaq listing requirement that we have a minimum of 400 round lot holders of our units. Subject to Apollo purchasing at least 9.99% of the units in this offering and 100,000 private placement warrants concurrently with this offering (i) at the closing of this offering, we will issue and sell 175,000 founder shares, and (ii) at the closing of our initial business combination, we will issue and sell an additional 125,000 founder shares to Apollo less such number of shares subject to a reduction in ownership (as described below). The purchase price for the founder shares in each case will be $0.0058 per share and our sponsor will automatically forfeit to the company for cancellation, for $0.0058 per share, a number of founder shares equal to the number of founder shares purchased by Apollo. However, if Apollo does not enter into a binding commitment to purchase an amount of Class A ordinary shares with a value of at least $25,000,000 (or equivalent securities of the target of the business combination or the successor registrant of the Company) in a private placement financing that will close concurrently with the closing of the initial business combination, the number of founder shares that Apollo will be entitled to purchase at the closing of our initial business combination will be reduced up to 125,000 founder shares on a pro rata basis. Additionally, if immediately following the closing of the initial business combination, (i) Apollo owns less than 100% but more than 50% of the 9.99% of the Class A ordinary shares sold by the company in this offering (including any shares sold by the underwriter in connection with the exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option), then Apollo will forfeit its right to purchase up to 50,000 founder shares on a pro rata basis, or (ii) Apollo owns less than 50% of the 9.99% of the Class A ordinary shares sold by the Company in this offering (including any shares sold by the underwriter in connection with the exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option), then Apollo will forfeit its right to purchase up to 75,000 founder shares in addition to the forfeiture of 50,000 founder shares pursuant to (i) on a pro rata basis. In the event our sponsor deems it necessary in order to facilitate an initial business combination for the sponsor to forfeit, transfer, exchange or amend the terms of all or any portion of the founder shares or to enter into any other arrangements with respect to the founder shares (including, without limitation, a transfer of the sponsor’s membership interests representing an interest in any of the foregoing), such change in investment will apply pro rata to Apollo and our sponsor based on the relative number of founder shares to be held by each, and, accordingly, Apollo will forfeit its right to purchase up to 125,000 founder shares as necessary to facilitate the foregoing. In the event that a reduction of ownership in Apollo’s founder shares exceeds the 125,000 additional founder shares eligible for purchase by Apollo, effective on the closing of an initial business combination, Apollo will forfeit to us, for reissuance to our sponsor, an amount of its additional founder shares previously purchased equal to such excess, provided that Apollo will not be required to forfeit more than 125,000 of the additional founder shares purchased (such that Apollo will in all circumstances be allowed to retain at least 50,000 founder shares).\n\nWe have agreed to reissue to our sponsor, at a price of $0.0058 per share, a number of founder shares equal to any founder shares or rights to purchase founder shares forfeited by Apollo.\n\nBecause these expressions of interest are not binding agreements or commitments to purchase, Apollo may determine to purchase more, fewer or no units in this offering or the underwriter may determine to sell more, fewer or no units to Apollo. In the event that Apollo does not purchase at least the amount of units for which it has expressed \n\n144\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nan interest and the warrants, as described herein, Apollo will not be entitled to purchase from our sponsor the founder shares described in this prospectus. In the event that Apollo purchases such units (either in this offering or after) and votes its public shares in favor of our initial business combination, a smaller portion of affirmative votes from other public shareholders would be required to approve our initial business combination. Apollo is required to vote its public shares in favor of our initial business combination. However, because Apollo is not obligated to continue owning any public shares following the closing, we cannot assure you that Apollo will be a shareholder at the time of our initial business combination. Apollo is required to vote its public shares in favor of our initial business combination.\n\nThere is no ceiling on the number of units that may be purchased by Apollo in this offering or on the number of our units, shares or warrants that they may purchase after this offering. However, Apollo has not indicated that it would purchase any additional units in this offering or any of our securities after the closing of this offering.\n\nAlthough we and the underwriter are not required to sell Apollo units in this offering, we expect the underwriter to sell to Apollo units up to its expression of interest, subject to our satisfying the Nasdaq listing requirement that we have a minimum of 400 round lot holders of our units. We are not aware of any circumstances (other than the Nasdaq listing requirement) under which we or the underwriter would prohibit Apollo from purchasing the applicable number of units it has expressed an interest in purchasing in this offering.\n\nIn addition, the units (including the underlying public shares and warrants) Apollo may purchase in this offering will not be subject to any agreements restricting their transfer.\n\nOur sponsor and Apollo have committed, pursuant to a written agreement, to purchase an aggregate of 7,750,000 private placement warrants (or 8,650,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full), each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, at a price of $1.00 per warrant ($7,750,000 in the aggregate or $8,650,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full), in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of this offering. Our sponsor will purchase 7,650,000 private placement warrants (or 8,550,000 private placement warrants if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) and Apollo will purchase 100,000 private placement warrants. If we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering, the private placement warrants will expire worthless. The private placement warrants are subject to the transfer restrictions described below. The private placement warrants will not be redeemable by us so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. Our sponsor, Apollo or their permitted transferees, have the option to exercise the private placement warrants on a cashless basis. If the private placement warrants are held by holders other than initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the units being sold in this offering. Otherwise, the private placement warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants being sold as part of the units in this offering.\n\nIn the event that our sponsor deems it necessary in order to facilitate our initial business combination for the sponsor to forfeit, transfer, exchange or amend the terms of all or any portion of the private placement warrants or to enter into any other arrangements with respect to the private placement warrants (including, without limitation, a transfer of the sponsor’s membership interests representing an interest in the private placement warrants) to facilitate the consummation of such business combination, such change shall apply pro rata to Apollo and our sponsor based on the relative number of private placement warrants held by each. By way of example, in the event 50% of the sponsor’s private placement warrants are forfeited or transferred by the sponsor as part of such business combination, Apollo shall forfeit or transfer 50% of its private placement warrants on substantially the same terms and conditions as the sponsor, in which case the reduction shall equal 50% of the private placement warrants held by Apollo at such time.\n\nOur sponsor, and our officers and directors are deemed to be our “promoters” as such term is defined under the federal securities laws.\n\nTransfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants\n\nThe founder shares, private placement warrants and any Class A ordinary shares issued upon conversion or exercise thereof are each subject to transfer restrictions pursuant to lock-up provisions in the letter agreement entered into by our initial shareholders, directors and officers. Pursuant to such letter agreement, our initial shareholders, directors and officers have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell (i) any of their founder shares until the earlier to occur \n\n145\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nof: (a) one year after the completion of our initial business combination; and (b) subsequent to our initial business combination (x) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property or (y) if the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and other similar transactions) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination and (ii) any of their private placement warrants and the respective Class A ordinary shares underlying such warrants until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. The foregoing restrictions are not applicable to transfers (a) to our officers or directors, any affiliates or family members of any of our officers or directors, any members of our sponsor or their affiliates, or any affiliates of our sponsor, (b) in the case of an individual, by gift to a member of one of the individual’s immediate family or to a trust, the beneficiary of that is a member of the individual’s immediate family, an affiliate of such person or to a charitable organization, (c) in the case of an individual, by virtue of laws of descent and distribution upon death of the individual, (d) in the case of an individual, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, (e) by private sales or transfers made in connection with any forward purchase agreement or similar arrangement or in connection with the consummation of a business combination at prices no greater than the price at which the applicable securities were originally purchased, (f) by virtue of the laws of the Cayman Islands or the limited liability company agreement of our sponsor upon dissolution of the sponsor, (g) in the event of the company’s liquidation prior to the completion of a business combination, (h) to the company for no value for cancellation in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, or (i) in the event of our completion of a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property subsequent to our completion of our initial business combination; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (a) through (f) these permitted transferees must enter into a written agreement agreeing to be bound by these transfer restrictions and the other restrictions contained in the letter agreements.\n\nRegistration Rights\n\nThe holders of the founder shares, private placement warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans (and any Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the private placement warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be entered into on or prior to the closing of this offering. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our completion of our initial business combination. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\n\n146\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\n\nOn April 7, 2021, we issued to our sponsor an aggregate of 4,312,500 founder shares in exchange for a payment of $25,000 from our sponsor to cover certain expenses on behalf of us, or approximately $0.006 per share. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by the sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The per share price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash the sponsor paid for the founder shares by the number of founder shares issued. At or prior to this offering, our sponsor will transfer 30,000 founder shares to each of Joel Motley, Matt Goldberg, and Priscilla Han, and 25,000 founder shares to each of Norman Pearlstine and Dale Mathias, our independent director nominees at the same price originally paid for such shares. In addition, at or prior to this offering, our sponsor will transfer an aggregate of 100,000 founder shares to six advisors at the same price as originally paid for such shares. Up to 562,500 founder shares will be surrendered to us by our sponsor for no consideration after the closing of this offering depending on the extent to which the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised. The total number of Class B ordinary shares outstanding after this offering and the expiration of the underwriter’s over-allotment option will equal 20% of the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares outstanding at such time. The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder thereof, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment, as described in this prospectus. If we increase or decrease the size of this offering, we will effect a share capitalization or a share repurchase or redemption or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable, with respect to our Class B ordinary shares immediately prior to the consummation of this offering in such amount as to maintain the number of founder shares, on an as-converted basis, at 20% of the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares outstanding at such time (assuming the underwriter exercises its over-allotment option in full).\n\nOur sponsor and Apollo have committed, pursuant to separate written agreements, to purchase an aggregate of 7,750,000 private placement warrants (or 8,650,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full), each exercisable to purchase one ordinary share at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, at a price of $1.00 per warrant ($7,750,000 in the aggregate or $8,650,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full), in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of this offering. Our sponsor will purchase 7,650,000 private placement warrants (or 8,550,000 warrants if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) and Apollo will purchase 100,000 private placement warrants. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder to purchase one ordinary share at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The private placement warrants (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor.\n\nIn the event that our sponsor deems it necessary in order to facilitate our initial business combination for the sponsor to forfeit, transfer, exchange or amend the terms of all or any portion of the private placement warrants or to enter into any other arrangements with respect to the private placement warrants (including, without limitation, a transfer of the sponsor’s membership interests representing an interest in the private placement warrants) to facilitate the consummation of such business combination, such change shall apply pro rata to Apollo and our sponsor based on the relative number of private placement warrants held by each. By way of example, in the event 50% of the sponsor’s private placement warrants are forfeited or transferred by the sponsor as part of such business combination, Apollo shall forfeit or transfer 50% of its private placement warrants on substantially the same terms and conditions as the sponsor, in which case the reduction shall equal 50% of the private placement warrants held by Apollo at such time.\n\nAs more fully discussed in the section of this prospectus entitled “Management — Conflicts of Interest,” if any of our founders, officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he, she or it has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, then, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, he, she or it will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity.\n\nOther than these fees, no compensation of any kind, including finder’s and consulting fees, will be paid by the company to our sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the completion of an initial business combination. However, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating, negotiating and completing an initial business combination. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates.\n\n147\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nWe will pay an affiliate of our sponsor $10,000 per month for office space, administrative and support services, commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on the Nasdaq.\n\nPrior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor may loan us funds to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans would be non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of April 30, 2022 or the closing of this offering. The loan would be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the estimated $627,366 (without giving effect to the underwriter’s reimbursement to us) of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses.\n\nIn addition, in order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required on a non-interest basis. If we complete our initial business combination, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds held in the trust account released to us. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. Except as set forth above, the terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.\n\nAfter our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our shareholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, furnished to our shareholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a general meeting held to consider our initial business combination, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation.\n\nApollo has expressed to us an interest to purchase an aggregate of approximately $14,985,000 or approximately 9.99%, of the units in this offering at the public offering price, and we have agreed to direct the underwriter to sell to Apollo such amount of units, subject to our satisfying the Nasdaq listing requirement that we have a minimum of 400 round lot holders of our units. Subject to Apollo purchasing at least 9.99% of the units in this offering and 100,000 private placement warrants concurrently with this offering (i) at the closing of this offering, we will issue and sell 175,000 founder shares, and (ii) at the closing of our initial business combination, we will issue and sell an additional 125,000 founder shares to Apollo less such number of shares subject to a reduction in ownership (as described below). The purchase price for the founder shares in each case will be $0.0058 per share and our sponsor will automatically forfeit to the company for cancellation, for $0.0058 per share, a number of founder shares equal to the number of founder shares purchased by Apollo. However, if Apollo does not enter into a binding commitment to purchase an amount of Class A ordinary shares with a value of at least $25,000,000 (or equivalent securities of the target of the business combination or the successor registrant of the Company) in a private placement financing that will close concurrently with the closing of the initial business combination, the number of founder shares that Apollo will be entitled to purchase at the closing of our initial business combination will be reduced up to 125,000 founder shares on a pro rata basis. Additionally, if immediately following the closing of the initial business combination, (i) Apollo owns less than 100% but more than 50% of the 9.99% of the Class A ordinary shares sold by the company in this offering (including any shares sold by the underwriter in connection with the exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option), then Apollo will forfeit its right to purchase up to 50,000 founder shares on a pro rata basis, or (ii) Apollo owns less than 50% of the 9.99% of the Class A ordinary shares sold by the Company in this offering (including any shares sold by the underwriter in connection with the exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option), then Apollo will forfeit its right to purchase up to 75,000 founder shares in addition to the forfeiture of 50,000 founder shares pursuant to (i) on a pro rata basis. In the event our sponsor deems it necessary in order to facilitate an initial business combination for the sponsor to forfeit, transfer, exchange or amend the terms of all or any portion of the founder shares or to enter into any other arrangements with respect to the founder shares (including, without limitation, a transfer of the sponsor’s membership interests representing an interest in any of the foregoing), such change in investment will apply pro rata to Apollo and our sponsor based on the relative number \n\n148\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nof founder shares to be held by each, and, accordingly, Apollo will forfeit its right to purchase up to 125,000 founder shares as necessary to facilitate the foregoing. In the event that a reduction of ownership in Apollo’s founder shares exceeds the 125,000 additional founder shares eligible for purchase by Apollo, effective on the closing of an initial business combination, Apollo will forfeit to us, for reissuance to our sponsor, an amount of its additional founder shares previously purchased equal to such excess, provided that Apollo will not be required to forfeit more than 125,000 of the additional founder shares purchased (such that Apollo will in all circumstances be allowed to retain at least 50,000 founder shares).\n\nWe have agreed to reissue to our sponsor, at a price of $0.0058 per share, a number of founder shares equal to any founder shares or rights to purchase founder shares forfeited by Apollo.\n\nBecause these expressions of interest are not binding agreements or commitments to purchase, Apollo may determine to purchase more, fewer or no units in this offering or the underwriter may determine to sell more, fewer or no units to Apollo. In the event that Apollo does not purchase at least the amount of units for which it has expressed an interest and the warrants, as described herein, Apollo will not be entitled to purchase from our sponsor the founder shares described in this prospectus. In the event that Apollo purchases such units (either in this offering or after) and votes its public shares in favor of our initial business combination, a smaller portion of affirmative votes from other public shareholders would be required to approve our initial business combination. Apollo is required to vote its public shares in favor of our initial business combination. However, because Apollo is not obligated to continue owning any public shares following the closing, we cannot assure you that Apollo will be a shareholder at the time of our initial business combination. Apollo is required to vote its public shares in favor of our initial business combination.\n\nThere is no ceiling on the number of units that may be purchased by Apollo in this offering or on the number of our units, shares or warrants that they may purchase after this offering. However, Apollo has not indicated that it would purchase any additional units in this offering or any of our securities after the closing of this offering.\n\nAlthough we and the underwriter are not required to sell Apollo units in this offering, we expect the underwriter to sell to Apollo units up to its expression of interest, subject to our satisfying the Nasdaq listing requirement that we have a minimum of 400 round lot holders of our units. We are not aware of any circumstances (other than the Nasdaq listing requirement) under which we or the underwriter would prohibit Apollo from purchasing the applicable number of units it has expressed an interest in purchasing in this offering.\n\nIn addition, the units (including the underlying public shares and warrants) Apollo may purchase in this offering will not be subject to any agreements restricting their transfer.\n\nWe have entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to the founder shares and private placement warrants, which is described under the heading “Principal Shareholders — Registration Rights.”\n\nPolicy for Approval of Related Party Transactions\n\nThe audit committee of our board of directors will adopt a charter, providing for the review, approval and/or ratification of “related party transactions,” which are those transactions required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K as promulgated by the SEC, by the audit committee. At its meetings, the audit committee shall be provided with the details of each new, existing, or proposed related party transaction, including the terms of the transaction, any contractual restrictions that the company has already committed to, the business purpose of the transaction, and the benefits of the transaction to the company and to the relevant related party. Any member of the committee who has an interest in the related party transaction under review by the committee shall abstain from voting on the approval of the related party transaction, but may, if so requested by the chairman of the committee, participate in some or all of the committee’s discussions of the related party transaction. Upon completion of its review of the related party transaction, the committee may determine to permit or to prohibit the related party transaction.\n\nManagement will present to the audit committee each proposed related party transaction, including all relevant facts and circumstances relating thereto. Under the policy, we may consummate related party transactions only if our audit committee approves or ratifies the transaction in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the policy. The policy will not permit any director or executive officer to participate in the discussion of, or decision concerning, a related person transaction in which he or she is the related party.\n\n149\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES\n\nWe are a Cayman Islands exempted company and our affairs will be governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the Companies Act and the common law of the Cayman Islands. Pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association which will be adopted prior to the consummation of this offering, we will be authorized to issue 221,000,000 shares, $0.0001 par value each, including 200,000,000 Class A ordinary shares and 20,000,000 Class B ordinary shares, as well as 1,000,000 preference shares, $0.0001 par value each. The following description summarizes the material terms of our shares as set out more particularly in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association.\n\nBecause it is only a summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to you.\n\nUnits\n\nEach unit has an offering price of $10.00 and consists of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant entitles its holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as described in this prospectus. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of the company’s Class A ordinary shares. This means only a whole warrant may be exercised at any given time by a warrant holder.\n\nThe Class A ordinary shares and warrants comprising the units are expected to begin separate trading on the 52nd day following the date of this prospectus (or, if such day is not a business day, on the next succeeding business day) unless Needham & Company, LLC informs us of its decision to allow earlier separate trading, subject to our having filed the Current Report on Form 8-K described below and having issued a press release announcing when such separate trading will begin. Once the Class A ordinary shares and warrants commence separate trading, holders will have the option to continue to hold units or separate their units into the component securities. Holders will need to have their brokers contact our transfer agent in order to separate the units into Class A ordinary shares and warrants. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. Accordingly, unless you purchase a multiple of two units, the number of warrants issuable to you upon separation of the units will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of warrants.\n\nIn no event will the Class A ordinary shares and warrants be traded separately until we have filed with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K which includes an audited balance of the company sheet reflecting our receipt of the gross proceeds of this offering. We will file a Current Report on Form 8-K which includes this audited balance sheet promptly after the completion of this offering. If the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised following the initial filing of such Current Report on Form 8-K, a second or amended Current Report on Form 8-K will be filed to provide updated financial information to reflect the exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option.\n\nAdditionally, the units will automatically separate into their component parts and will not be traded after completion of our initial business combination.\n\nOrdinary Shares\n\nPrior to the date of this prospectus, there were 4,312,500 Class B ordinary shares outstanding, all of which were held of record by our initial shareholders so that our initial shareholders will own 20% of the sum of the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares outstanding after this offering and the expiration of the underwriter’s over-allotment option (assuming our initial shareholders do not purchase any units in this offering). Up to 562,500 of the founder shares will be surrendered by our sponsor for no consideration depending on the extent to which the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised. Upon the closing of this offering, 18,750,000 of our ordinary shares will be outstanding (assuming no exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option and the corresponding surrender for no consideration of 562,500 founder shares by our initial shareholders) including:\n\n•| 15,000,000 Class A ordinary shares underlying the units issued as part of this offering; and   \n---|---  \n•| 4,312,500 Class B ordinary shares held by our initial shareholders.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf we increase or decrease the size of this offering, we will effect a share capitalization or a share repurchase or redemption or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable, with respect to our Class B ordinary shares immediately prior to the consummation of this offering in such amount as to maintain the number of founder shares, on an as-converted basis, at 20% of the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares outstanding at such time (assuming the underwriter exercises its over-allotment option in full).\n\n150\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nOrdinary shareholders of record are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by shareholders. Except as described below, holders of Class A ordinary shares and holders of Class B ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders except as required by law. Unless specified in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, or as required by applicable provisions of the Companies Act or applicable stock exchange rules, an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company, is required to approve any such matter voted on by our shareholders. Approval of certain actions will require a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares that are voted, and pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association; such actions include amending our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and approving a statutory merger or consolidation with another company. Our board of directors is divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being appointed in each year. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the appointment of directors, with the result that the holders of more than 50% of the shares voted for the appointment of directors can appoint all of the directors. However, only holders of Class B ordinary shares will have the right to appoint directors prior to or in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, meaning that holders of Class A ordinary shares will not have the right to appoint any directors until after the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, prior to the completion of an initial business combination, holders of a majority of our founder shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason. The provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association relating to the rights of holders of Class B ordinary shares to appoint or remove directors prior to our initial business combination may only be amended by a special resolution passed by a majority of at least 90% of our ordinary shares voting in a general meeting. Our shareholders are entitled to receive ratable dividends when, as and if declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefor.\n\nBecause our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will authorize the issuance of up to 200,000,000 Class A ordinary shares, if we were to enter into a business combination, we may (depending on the terms of such a business combination) be required to increase the number of Class A ordinary shares which we are authorized to issue at the same time as our shareholders vote on the business combination to the extent we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination.\n\nOur board of directors is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being appointed in each year and each class (except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual general meeting) serving a three-year term. In accordance with Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual general meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on Nasdaq. There is no requirement under the Companies Act for us to hold annual or extraordinary general meetings to appoint directors. We may not hold an annual general meeting to appoint new directors prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. Prior to the completion of an initial business combination, any vacancy on the board of directors may be filled by a nominee chosen by holders of a majority of our founder shares. In addition, prior to the completion of an initial business combination, holders of a majority of our founder shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason.\n\nWe will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest (net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.20 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriter. Our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. The other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our sponsor with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after this offering.\n\nUnlike many blank check companies that hold shareholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations and provide for related redemptions of public shares for cash upon completion of such initial business combinations even when a vote is not required by law, if a shareholder vote is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote \n\n151\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nfor business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will require these tender offer documents to contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. If, however, a shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, like many blank check companies, offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we receive an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. However, the participation of our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates in privately negotiated transactions (as described in this prospectus), if any, could result in the approval of our initial business combination even if a majority of our public shareholders vote, or indicate their intention to vote, against such initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of an ordinary resolution, non-votes and abstentions will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will require that at least five days’ notice will be given of any general meeting.\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to Excess Shares, without our prior consent.\n\nHowever, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Our shareholders’ inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce their influence over our ability to complete our initial business combination, and such shareholders could suffer a material loss in their investment if they sell such Excess Shares on the open market. Additionally, such shareholders will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if we complete our initial business combination. And, as a result, such shareholders will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding 15% and, in order to dispose such shares would be required to sell their shares in open market transactions, potentially at a loss.\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ founder shares, we would need 5,625,001, or 37.5% (assuming all outstanding shares are voted and the underwriter’s over-allotment option is not exercised) of the 15,000,000 public shares sold in this offering to be voted in favor of a transaction, in order to have such initial business combination approved. The other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our sponsor with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after this offering. Additionally, each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all.\n\nPursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, if we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case, to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. Our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial \n\n152\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nbusiness combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering. However, if our initial shareholders or management team acquire public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time period. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law.\n\nIn the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company after a business combination, our shareholders are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining available for distribution to them after payment of liabilities and after provision is made for each class of shares, if any, having preference over the ordinary shares. Our shareholders have no preemptive or other subscription rights. There are no sinking fund provisions applicable to the ordinary shares, except that we will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares for cash at a per share price equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, upon the completion of our initial business combination, subject to the limitations described herein.\n\nFounder Shares\n\nThe founder shares are designated as Class B ordinary shares and, except as described below, are identical to the Class A ordinary shares included in the units being sold in this offering, and holders of founder shares have the same shareholder rights as public shareholders, except that (i) prior to our initial business combination, only holders of our Class B ordinary shares have the right to vote on the appointment of directors, including in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and holders of a majority of our Class B ordinary shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason; (ii) the founder shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions contained in a letter agreement that our initial shareholders, directors and officers have entered into with us, as described in more detail below; (iii) pursuant to such letter agreement, our initial shareholders, directors and officers have agreed to (A) waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares held by them, as applicable, in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, (B) waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares held by them, as applicable, in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (1) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering or (2) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity and (C) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame); (iv) the founder shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder thereof, as described below; and (v) the founder shares are entitled to registration rights. If we submit our initial business combination to our public shareholders for a vote, Apollo, our initial shareholders, directors and officers have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial business combination. The other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our sponsor with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after this offering.\n\nThe founder shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder thereof, on a one-for-one basis. However, if additional Class A ordinary shares or any other equity-linked securities are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts issued in this offering and related to the closing of our initial business combination, the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all founder shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as converted basis, 20% of the sum of (i) the total number of ordinary shares outstanding upon \n\n153\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\ncompletion of this offering plus (ii) the total number of Class A ordinary shares issued, or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of the initial business combination, excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A ordinary shares issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial business combination and any private placement warrants issued to our sponsor or Apollo upon conversion of working capital loans, provided that such conversion of Class B ordinary shares will never occur on a less than one-for-one basis.\n\nOur initial shareholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares until the earlier to occur of: (i) one year after the completion of our initial business combination; and (ii) subsequent to our initial business combination (x) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property or (y) if the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and other similar transactions) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination (except as described in the section entitled “Principal Shareholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants”). Any permitted transferees will be subject to the same restrictions and other agreements of our initial shareholders with respect to any founder shares. \n\nPrior to our initial business combination, only holders of our founder shares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors. Holders of our public shares will not be entitled to vote on the appointment of directors during such time. In addition, prior to the completion of an initial business combination, holders of a majority of our founder shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may only be amended by a special resolution passed by a majority of at least 90% of our ordinary shares voting in a general meeting. With respect to any other matter submitted to a vote of our shareholders, including any vote in connection with our initial business combination, except as required by law, holders of our founder shares and holders of our public shares will vote together as a single class, with each share entitling the holder to one vote.\n\nRegister of Members\n\nUnder Cayman Islands law, we must keep a register of members and there will be entered therein:\n\n•| the names and addresses of the members, a statement of the shares held by each member, and of the amount paid or agreed to be considered as paid, on the shares of each member and the voting rights of shares;  \n---|---  \n•| the date on which the name of any person was entered on the register as a member; and  \n---|---  \n•| the date on which any person ceased to be a member.  \n---|---  \n  \nUnder Cayman Islands law, the register of members of our company is prima facie evidence of the matters set out therein (i.e., the register of members will raise a presumption of fact on the matters referred to above unless rebutted) and a member registered in the register of members will be deemed as a matter of Cayman Islands law to have legal title to the shares as set against its name in the register of members. Upon the closing of this public offering, the register of members will be immediately updated to reflect the issue of shares by us. Once our register of members has been updated, the shareholders recorded in the register of members will be deemed to have legal title to the shares set against their name. However, there are certain limited circumstances where an application may be made to a Cayman Islands court for a determination on whether the register of members reflects the correct legal position. Further, the Cayman Islands court has the power to order that the register of members maintained by a company should be rectified where it considers that the register of members does not reflect the correct legal position. If an application for an order for rectification of the register of members were made in respect of our ordinary shares, then the validity of such shares may be subject to re-examination by a Cayman Islands court.\n\nPreference Shares\n\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will authorize 1,000,000 preference shares and provide that preference shares may be issued from time to time in one or more series. Our board of directors will be authorized to fix the voting rights, if any, designations, powers, preferences, the relative, participating, optional or other special rights and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, applicable to the shares of each series. Our board of directors will be able to, without shareholder approval, issue preference shares with voting and \n\n154\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nother rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of the ordinary shares and could have anti-takeover effects. The ability of our board of directors to issue preference shares without shareholder approval could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us or the removal of existing management. We have no preference shares outstanding at the date hereof. Although we do not currently intend to issue any preference shares, we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future. No preference shares are being issued or registered in this offering.\n\nWarrants\n\nPublic Shareholders’ Warrants\n\nEach whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time commencing on the later of one year from the closing of this offering and 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination, except as discussed in the immediately succeeding paragraph. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of Class A ordinary shares. This means only a whole warrant may be exercised at a given time by a warrant holder. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. Accordingly, unless you purchase a multiple of two units, the number of warrants issuable to you upon separation of the units will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of warrants. The warrants will expire five years after the completion of our initial business combination, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.\n\nWe will not be obligated to deliver any Class A ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Class A ordinary shares underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to our satisfying our obligations described below with respect to registration, or a valid exemption from registration is available. No warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue a Class A ordinary share upon exercise of a warrant unless the Class A ordinary share issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants. In the event that the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a warrant, the holder of such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant. In the event that a registration statement is not effective for the exercised warrants, the purchaser of a unit containing such warrant will have paid the full purchase price for the unit solely for the Class A ordinary share underlying such unit.\n\nWe are not registering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants at this time. However, we have agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days after the closing of our initial business combination, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement for the registration, under the Securities Act, of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants, and we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement to become effective within 60 business days after the closing of our initial business combination, and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement; provided that if our Class A ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b) (1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of public warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. If a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th business day after the closing of the initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption, but we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of Class A ordinary shares equal to the lesser of (A) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of Class A ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “Fair Market Value” (defined \n\n155\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nbelow) less the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the Fair Market Value and (B) 0.361. The “Fair Market Value” as used in this paragraph shall mean the volume weighted average price of the Class A ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date on which the notice of exercise is received by the warrant agent.\n\nRedemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $18.00. Once the warrants become exercisable, we may redeem the outstanding warrants (except as described herein with respect to the private placement warrants):\n\n•| in whole and not in part;  \n---|---  \n•| at a price of $0.01 per warrant;  \n---|---  \n•| upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and  \n---|---  \n•| if, and only if, the closing price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under the heading “— Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants — Anti-Dilution Adjustments”) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three trading days before we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe will not redeem the warrants as described above unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares is available throughout the 30-day redemption period. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem warrants even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise their warrants.\n\nWe have established the $18.00 (as adjusted) redemption criterion discussed above to prevent a redemption call unless there is at the time of the call a significant premium to the warrant exercise price. If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and we issue a notice of redemption of the warrants, each warrant holder will be entitled to exercise his, her or its warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. However, the price of the Class A ordinary shares may fall below the $18.00 redemption trigger price (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under the heading “— Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants — Anti-dilution Adjustments”) as well as the $11.50 (for whole shares) warrant exercise price after the redemption notice is issued.\n\nRedemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00. Once the warrants become exercisable, we may redeem the outstanding warrants:\n\n•| in whole and not in part;  \n---|---  \n•| at $0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption provided that holders will be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares determined by reference to the table below, based on the redemption date and the “Fair Market Value” of our Class A ordinary shares (as defined below) except as otherwise described below;  \n---|---  \n•| if, and only if, the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $10.00 per public share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under the heading “— Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants — Anti-Dilution Adjustments”) for any 20 trading days within the 30-trading day period ending three trading days before we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders; and  \n---|---  \n•| if the closing price of the Class A ordinary shares for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders is less than $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under the heading “— Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants — Anti-dilution Adjustments”), the private placement warrants must also be concurrently called for redemption on the same terms as the outstanding public warrants, as described above.  \n---|---  \n  \n156\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nBeginning on the date the notice of redemption is given until the warrants are redeemed or exercised, holders may elect to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. The numbers in the table below represent the number of Class A ordinary shares that a warrant holder will receive upon such cashless exercise in connection with a redemption by us pursuant to this redemption feature, based on the “Fair Market Value” of our Class A ordinary shares on the corresponding redemption date (assuming holders elect to exercise their warrants and such warrants are not redeemed for $0.10 per warrant), determined for these purposes based on volume weighted average price of our Class A ordinary shares during the 10 trading days immediately following the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants, and the number of months that the corresponding redemption date precedes the expiration date of the warrants, each as set forth in the table below. We will provide our warrant holders with the final Fair Market Value no later than one business day after the 10-trading day period described above ends.\n\nPursuant to the warrant agreement, references above to Class A ordinary shares shall include a security other than Class A ordinary shares into which the Class A ordinary shares have been converted or exchanged for in the event we are not the surviving company in our initial business combination. The numbers in the table below will not be adjusted when determining the number of Class A ordinary shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants if we are not the surviving entity following our initial business combination.\n\nThe share prices set forth in the column headings of the table below will be adjusted as of any date on which the number of shares issuable upon exercise of a warrant or the exercise price of a warrant is adjusted as set forth under the heading “— Anti-dilution Adjustments” below. If the number of shares issuable upon exercise of a warrant is adjusted, the adjusted share prices in the column headings will equal the share prices immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares deliverable upon exercise of a warrant immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the number of shares deliverable upon exercise of a warrant as so adjusted. The number of shares in the table below shall be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as the number of shares issuable upon exercise of a warrant. If the exercise price of a warrant is adjusted, (a) in the case of an adjustment pursuant to the fifth paragraph under the heading “— Anti-dilution Adjustments” below, the adjusted share prices in the column headings will equal the unadjusted share price multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price as set forth under the heading “— Anti-dilution Adjustments” and the denominator of which is $10.00 and (b) in the case of an adjustment pursuant to the second paragraph under the heading “— Anti-dilution Adjustments” below, the adjusted share prices in the column headings will equal the unadjusted share price less the decrease in the exercise price of a warrant pursuant to such exercise price adjustment.\n\n​| ​| Fair Market Value of Class A Ordinary Shares  \n---|---|---  \nRedemption Date (period to expiration of warrants)| ​| ​| ≤10.00| ​| ​| 11.00| ​| ​| 12.00| ​| ​| 13.00| ​| ​| 14.00| ​| ​| 15.00| ​| ​| 16.00| ​| ​| 17.00| ​| ​| ≥18.00  \n60 months| ​| ​| 0.261| ​| ​| 0.281| ​| ​| 0.297| ​| ​| 0.311| ​| ​| 0.324| ​| ​| 0.337| ​| ​| 0.348| ​| ​| 0.358| ​| ​| 0.361  \n57 months| ​| ​| 0.257| ​| ​| 0.277| ​| ​| 0.294| ​| ​| 0.310| ​| ​| 0.324| ​| ​| 0.337| ​| ​| 0.348| ​| ​| 0.358| ​| ​| 0.361  \n54 months| ​| ​| 0.252| ​| ​| 0.272| ​| ​| 0.291| ​| ​| 0.307| ​| ​| 0.322| ​| ​| 0.335| ​| ​| 0.347| ​| ​| 0.357| ​| ​| 0.361  \n51 months| ​| ​| 0.246| ​| ​| 0.268| ​| ​| 0.287| ​| ​| 0.304| ​| ​| 0.320| ​| ​| 0.333| ​| ​| 0.346| ​| ​| 0.357| ​| ​| 0.361  \n48 months| ​| ​| 0.241| ​| ​| 0.263| ​| ​| 0.283| ​| ​| 0.301| ​| ​| 0.317| ​| ​| 0.332| ​| ​| 0.344| ​| ​| 0.356| ​| ​| 0.361  \n45 months| ​| ​| 0.235| ​| ​| 0.258| ​| ​| 0.279| ​| ​| 0.298| ​| ​| 0.315| ​| ​| 0.330| ​| ​| 0.343| ​| ​| 0.356| ​| ​| 0.361  \n42 months| ​| ​| 0.228| ​| ​| 0.252| ​| ​| 0.274| ​| ​| 0.294| ​| ​| 0.312| ​| ​| 0.328| ​| ​| 0.342| ​| ​| 0.355| ​| ​| 0.361  \n39 months| ​| ​| 0.221| ​| ​| 0.246| ​| ​| 0.269| ​| ​| 0.290| ​| ​| 0.309| ​| ​| 0.325| ​| ​| 0.340| ​| ​| 0.354| ​| ​| 0.361  \n36 months| ​| ​| 0.213| ​| ​| 0.239| ​| ​| 0.263| ​| ​| 0.285| ​| ​| 0.305| ​| ​| 0.323| ​| ​| 0.339| ​| ​| 0.353| ​| ​| 0.361  \n33 months| ​| ​| 0.205| ​| ​| 0.232| ​| ​| 0.257| ​| ​| 0.280| ​| ​| 0.301| ​| ​| 0.320| ​| ​| 0.337| ​| ​| 0.352| ​| ​| 0.361  \n30 months| ​| ​| 0.196| ​| ​| 0.224| ​| ​| 0.250| ​| ​| 0.274| ​| ​| 0.297| ​| ​| 0.316| ​| ​| 0.335| ​| ​| 0.351| ​| ​| 0.361  \n27 months| ​| ​| 0.185| ​| ​| 0.214| ​| ​| 0.242| ​| ​| 0.268| ​| ​| 0.291| ​| ​| 0.313| ​| ​| 0.332| ​| ​| 0.350| ​| ​| 0.361  \n24 months| ​| ​| 0.173| ​| ​| 0.204| ​| ​| 0.233| ​| ​| 0.260| ​| ​| 0.285| ​| ​| 0.308| ​| ​| 0.329| ​| ​| 0.348| ​| ​| 0.361  \n21 months| ​| ​| 0.161| ​| ​| 0.193| ​| ​| 0.223| ​| ​| 0.252| ​| ​| 0.279| ​| ​| 0.304| ​| ​| 0.326| ​| ​| 0.347| ​| ​| 0.361  \n18 months| ​| ​| 0.146| ​| ​| 0.179| ​| ​| 0.211| ​| ​| 0.242| ​| ​| 0.271| ​| ​| 0.298| ​| ​| 0.322| ​| ​| 0.345| ​| ​| 0.361  \n15 months| ​| ​| 0.130| ​| ​| 0.164| ​| ​| 0.197| ​| ​| 0.230| ​| ​| 0.262| ​| ​| 0.291| ​| ​| 0.317| ​| ​| 0.342| ​| ​| 0.361  \n12 months| ​| ​| 0.111| ​| ​| 0.146| ​| ​| 0.181| ​| ​| 0.216| ​| ​| 0.250| ​| ​| 0.282| ​| ​| 0.312| ​| ​| 0.339| ​| ​| 0.361  \n9 months| ​| ​| 0.090| ​| ​| 0.125| ​| ​| 0.162| ​| ​| 0.199| ​| ​| 0.237| ​| ​| 0.272| ​| ​| 0.305| ​| ​| 0.336| ​| ​| 0.361  \n6 months| ​| ​| 0.065| ​| ​| 0.099| ​| ​| 0.137| ​| ​| 0.178| ​| ​| 0.219| ​| ​| 0.259| ​| ​| 0.296| ​| ​| 0.331| ​| ​| 0.361  \n3 months| ​| ​| 0.034| ​| ​| 0.065| ​| ​| 0.104| ​| ​| 0.150| ​| ​| 0.197| ​| ​| 0.243| ​| ​| 0.286| ​| ​| 0.326| ​| ​| 0.361  \n0 months| ​| ​| —| ​| ​| —| ​| ​| 0.042| ​| ​| 0.115| ​| ​| 0.179| ​| ​| 0.233| ​| ​| 0.281| ​| ​| 0.323| ​| ​| 0.361  \n  \n157\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nThe exact fair market value and redemption date may not be set forth in the table above, in which case, if the fair market value is between two values in the table or the redemption date is between two redemption dates in the table, the number of Class A ordinary shares to be issued for each warrant exercised will be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the number of shares set forth for the higher and lower fair market values and the earlier and later redemption dates, as applicable, based on a 365 or 366-day year, as applicable. For example, if the volume weighted average price of our Class A ordinary shares during the 10 trading days immediately following the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of the warrants is $11.00 per share, and at such time there are 57 months until the expiration of the warrants, holders may choose to, in connection with this redemption feature, exercise their warrants for 0.277 Class A ordinary shares for each whole warrant. For an example where the exact fair market value and redemption date are not as set forth in the table above, if the volume weighted average price of our Class A ordinary shares during the 10 trading days immediately following the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of the warrants is $13.50 per share, and at such time there are 38 months until the expiration of the warrants, holders may choose to, in connection with this redemption feature, exercise their warrants for 0.298 Class A ordinary shares for each whole warrant. In no event will the warrants be exercisable on a cashless basis in connection with this redemption feature for more than 0.361 Class A ordinary shares per warrant (subject to adjustment). Finally, as reflected in the table above, if the warrants are out of the money and about to expire, they cannot be exercised on a cashless basis in connection with a redemption by us pursuant to this redemption feature, since they will not be exercisable for any Class A ordinary shares.\n\nThis redemption feature differs from the warrant redemption features used in some other blank check offerings, which typically only provide for a redemption of warrants for cash (other than the private placement warrants) when the trading price for the Class A ordinary shares exceeds $18.00 per share for a specified period of time. This redemption feature is structured to allow for all of the outstanding warrants to be redeemed when the Class A ordinary shares are trading at or above $10.00 per public share, which may be at a time when the trading price of our Class A ordinary shares is below the exercise price of the warrants. We have established this redemption feature to provide us with the flexibility to redeem the warrants without the warrants having to reach the $18.00 per share threshold set forth above under “— Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $18.00.” Holders choosing to exercise their warrants in connection with a redemption pursuant to this feature will, in effect, receive a number of shares for their warrants based on an option pricing model with a fixed volatility input as of the of this prospectus. This redemption right provides us with an additional mechanism by which to redeem all of the outstanding warrants, and therefore have certainty as to our capital structure as the warrants would no longer be outstanding and would have been exercised or redeemed. We will be required to pay the applicable redemption price to warrant holders if we choose to exercise this redemption right and it will allow us to quickly proceed with a redemption of the warrants if we determine it is in our best interest to do so. As such, we would redeem the warrants in this manner when we believe it is in our best interest to update our capital structure to remove the warrants and pay the redemption price to the warrant holders.\n\nAs stated above, we can redeem the warrants when the Class A ordinary shares are trading at a price starting at $10.00, which is below the exercise price of $11.50, because it will provide certainty with respect to our capital structure and cash position while providing warrant holders with the opportunity to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis for the applicable number of shares. If we choose to redeem the warrants when the Class A ordinary shares are trading at a price below the exercise price of the warrants, this could result in the warrant holders receiving fewer Class A ordinary shares than they would have received if they had chosen to wait to exercise their warrants for Class A ordinary shares if and when such Class A ordinary shares were trading at a price higher than the exercise price of $11.50.\n\nNo fractional Class A ordinary shares will be issued upon exercise. If, upon exercise, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will round down to the nearest whole number of the number of Class A ordinary shares to be issued to the holder. If, at the time of redemption, the warrants are exercisable for a security other than the Class A ordinary shares pursuant to the warrant agreement (for instance, if we are not the surviving company in our initial business combination), the warrants may be exercised for such security. At such time as the warrants become exercisable for a security other than the Class A ordinary shares, the company (or surviving company) will use its commercially reasonable efforts to register under the Securities Act the security issuable upon the exercise of the warrants.\n\nRedemption Procedures. A holder of a warrant may notify us in writing in the event it elects to be subject to a requirement that such holder will not have the right to exercise such warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to \n\n158\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nsuch exercise, such person (together with such person’s affiliates), to the warrant agent’s actual knowledge, would beneficially own in excess of 9.8% (or such other amount as a holder may specify) of the Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise.\n\nAnti-Dilution Adjustments. If the number of issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares is increased by a capitalization or share dividend paid in Class A ordinary shares to all or substantially all holders of Class A ordinary shares, or by a split-up of Class A ordinary shares or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such capitalization or share dividend, split-up or similar event, the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable on exercise of each warrant will be increased in proportion to such increase in the issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares. A rights offering made to all or substantially all holders of ordinary shares entitling holders to purchase Class A ordinary shares at a price less than the “historical fair market value” (as defined below) will be deemed a share dividend of a number of Class A ordinary shares equal to the product of (i) the number of Class A ordinary shares actually sold in such rights offering (or issuable under any other equity securities sold in such rights offering that are convertible into or exercisable for Class A ordinary shares) and (ii) one minus the quotient of (x) the price per Class A ordinary share paid in such rights offering and (y) the historical fair market value. For these purposes, (i) if the rights offering is for securities convertible into or exercisable for Class A ordinary shares, in determining the price payable for Class A ordinary shares, there will be taken into account any consideration received for such rights, as well as any additional amount payable upon exercise or conversion and (ii) “historical fair market value” means the volume weighted average price of Class A ordinary shares as reported during the 10 trading day period ending on the trading day prior to the first date on which the Class A ordinary shares trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, without the right to receive such rights.\n\nIn addition, if we, at any time while the warrants are outstanding and unexpired, pay a dividend or make a distribution in cash, securities or other assets to all or substantially all of the holders of Class A ordinary shares on account of such Class A ordinary shares (or other securities into which the warrants are then convertible), other than (a) as described above, (b) any cash dividends or cash distributions which, when combined on a per share basis with all other cash dividends and cash distributions paid on the Class A ordinary shares during the 365-day period ending on the date of declaration of such dividend or distribution, does not exceed $0.50 (as adjusted to appropriately reflect any other adjustments and excluding cash dividends or cash distributions that resulted in an adjustment to the exercise price or to the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable on exercise of each warrant) but only with respect to the amount of the aggregate cash dividends or cash distributions equal to or less than $0.50 per share, (c) to satisfy the redemption rights of the holders of Class A ordinary shares in connection with a proposed initial business combination, (d) to satisfy the redemption rights of the holders of Class A ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (i) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, or (e) in connection with the redemption of our public shares upon our failure to complete our initial business combination, then the warrant exercise price will be decreased, effective immediately after the effective date of such event, by the amount of cash and/or the fair market value of any securities or other assets paid on each Class A ordinary share in respect of such event.\n\nIf the number of issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares is decreased by a consolidation, combination, reverse share split or reclassification of Class A ordinary shares or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such consolidation, combination, reverse share split, reclassification or similar event, the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable on exercise of each warrant will be decreased in proportion to such decrease in issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares.\n\nWhenever the number of Class A ordinary shares purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants is adjusted, as described above, the warrant exercise price will be adjusted by multiplying the warrant exercise price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction (x) the numerator of which will be the number of Class A ordinary shares purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants immediately prior to such adjustment and (y) the denominator of which will be the number of Class A ordinary shares so purchasable immediately thereafter.\n\nIn addition, if (x) we issue additional ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of our initial business combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per ordinary share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by our board \n\n159\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nof directors and, in the case of any such issuance to our sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any founder shares held by our sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the “Newly Issued Price”), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our initial business combination on the date of the completion of our initial business combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of our Class A ordinary shares during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which we consummate our initial business combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.20 per share, then the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, the $10.00 per share redemption trigger price described above under “— Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00” will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the $18.00 per share redemption trigger price described above under “— Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $18.00” and “— Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00” will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.\n\nIn case of any reclassification or reorganization of the issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares (other than those described above or that solely affects the par value of such Class A ordinary shares), or in the case of any merger or consolidation of us with or into another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which we are the continuing corporation and that does not result in any reclassification or reorganization of our issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares), or in the case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation or entity of the assets or other property of us as an entirety or substantially as an entirety in connection with which we are dissolved, the holders of the warrants will thereafter have the right to purchase and receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified in the warrants and in lieu of the Class A ordinary shares immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented thereby, the kind and amount of Class A ordinary shares or other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, reorganization, merger or consolidation, or upon a dissolution following any such sale or transfer, that the holder of the warrants would have received if such holder had exercised their warrants immediately prior to such event. However, if such holders were entitled to exercise a right of election as to the kind or amount of securities, cash or other assets receivable upon such consolidation or merger, then the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets for which each warrant will become exercisable will be deemed to be the weighted average of the kind and amount received per share by such holders in such consolidation or merger that affirmatively make such election, and if a tender, exchange or redemption offer has been made to and accepted by such holders (other than a tender, exchange or redemption offer made by the company in connection with redemption rights held by shareholders of the company as provided for in the company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or as a result of the redemption of Class A ordinary shares by the company if a proposed initial business combination is presented to the shareholders of the company for approval) under circumstances in which, upon completion of such tender or exchange offer, the maker thereof, together with members of any group (within the meaning of Rule 13d-5(b)(1) under the Exchange Act) of which such maker is a part, and together with any affiliate or associate of such maker (within the meaning of Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) and any members of any such group of which any such affiliate or associate is a part, own beneficially (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) more than 50% of the issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares, the holder of a warrant will be entitled to receive the highest amount of cash, securities or other property to which such holder would actually have been entitled as a shareholder if such warrant holder had exercised the warrant prior to the expiration of such tender or exchange offer, accepted such offer and all of the Class A ordinary shares held by such holder had been purchased pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, subject to adjustment (from and after the consummation of such tender or exchange offer) as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments provided for in the warrant agreement. If less than 70% of the consideration receivable by the holders of Class A ordinary shares in such a transaction is payable in the form of Class A ordinary shares in the successor entity that is listed for trading on a national securities exchange or is quoted in an established over-the-counter market, or is to be so listed for trading or quoted immediately following such event, and if the registered holder of the warrant properly exercises the warrant within thirty days following public disclosure of such transaction, the warrant exercise price will be reduced as specified in the warrant agreement based on the Black-Scholes value (as defined in the warrant agreement) of the warrant. The purpose of such exercise price reduction is to provide additional value to holders of the warrants when an extraordinary transaction occurs during the exercise period of the warrants pursuant to which the holders of the warrants otherwise do not receive the full potential value of the warrants.\n\n160\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nThe warrants will be issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder for the purpose of (i) curing any ambiguity or correct any mistake, including to conform the provisions of the warrant agreement to the description of the terms of the warrants and the warrant agreement set forth in this prospectus, or defective provision (ii) amending the provisions relating to cash dividends on ordinary shares as contemplated by and in accordance with the warrant agreement or (iii) adding or changing any provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the warrant agreement as the parties to the warrant agreement may deem necessary or desirable and that the parties deem to not adversely affect the rights of the registered holders of the warrants, provided that the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants is required to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders and, solely with respect to any amendment to the terms of the private placement warrants or any provision of the warrant agreement with respect to the private placement warrants, at least 50% of the then outstanding private placement warrants. You should review a copy of the warrant agreement, which will be filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, for a complete description of the terms and conditions applicable to the warrants.\n\nThe warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of ordinary shares and any voting rights until they exercise their warrants and receive Class A ordinary shares. After the issuance of Class A ordinary shares upon exercise of the warrants, each holder will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by shareholders.\n\nNo fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number of Class A ordinary shares to be issued to the warrant holder.\n\nWe have agreed that, subject to applicable law, any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the warrant agreement will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction will be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. See “Risk Factors — Our warrant agreement will designate the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company.” This provision applies to claims under the Securities Act but does not apply to claims under the Exchange Act or any claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum.\n\nPrivate Placement Warrants\n\nExcept as described below, the private placement warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants being sold as part of the units in this offering. The private placement warrants (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination (except pursuant to limited exceptions as described under “Principal Shareholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants,” to our officers and directors and other persons or entities affiliated with the initial purchasers of the private placement warrants) and they will not be redeemable by us (except as described under “— Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants — Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00”) so long as they are held by our sponsor, Apollo or their permitted transferees (except as otherwise set forth herein). Our sponsor, Apollo or their permitted transferees, have the option to exercise the private placement warrants on a cashless basis. If the private placement warrants are held by holders other than our sponsor, Apollo or their permitted transferees, the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us in all redemption scenarios and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the units being sold in this offering. Any amendment to the terms of the private placement warrants or any provision of the warrant agreement with respect to the private placement warrants will require a vote of holders of at least 50% of the number of the then outstanding private placement warrants.\n\nIn connection with a redemption of our warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00, holders of private placement warrants who exercise their shares on a cashless basis would receive that number of shares determined by reference to the table set forth under “Description of Securities — Warrants — \n\n161\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nPublic Shareholders’ Warrants.” If holders of private placement warrants elect to exercise them on a cashless basis at any time other than in connection with such a redemption of warrants by us, they would pay the exercise price by surrendering their warrants for that number of Class A ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of Class A ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “Sponsor Fair Market Value” (defined below) over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the Sponsor Fair Market Value. The “Sponsor Fair Market Value” shall mean the average reported closing price of the Class A ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of warrant exercise is sent to the warrant agent. We expect to have policies in place that restrict insiders from selling our securities except during specific periods. Even during such periods of time when insiders will be permitted to sell our securities, an insider cannot trade in our securities if he or she is in possession of material non-public information. Accordingly, unlike public shareholders who could exercise their warrants and sell the Class A ordinary shares received upon such exercise freely in the open market in order to recoup the cost of such exercise, the insiders could be significantly restricted from selling such securities. As a result, we believe that allowing the holders to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis is appropriate.\n\nIn order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. Such warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants.\n\nDividends\n\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of our initial business combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of our initial business combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to our initial business combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. If we increase or decrease the size of this offering, we will effect a share capitalization or a share repurchase or redemption or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable, with respect to our Class B ordinary shares immediately prior to the consummation of this offering in such amount as to maintain the number of founder shares, on an as-converted basis, at 20% of the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares outstanding at such time (assuming the underwriter exercises its over-allotment option in full). Further, if we incur any indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.\n\nOur Transfer Agent and Warrant Agent\n\nThe transfer agent for our ordinary shares and warrant agent for our warrants is Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. We have agreed to indemnify Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company in its roles as transfer agent and warrant agent, its agents and each of its shareholders, directors, officers and employees against all claims and losses that may arise out of acts performed or omitted for its activities in that capacity, except for any claims and losses due to any gross negligence or intentional misconduct of the indemnified person or entity.\n\nContinental Stock Transfer & Trust Company has agreed that it has no right of set-off or any right, title, interest or claim of any kind to, or to any monies in, the trust account, and has irrevocably waived any right, title, interest or claim of any kind to, or to any monies in, the trust account that it may have now or in the future. Accordingly, any indemnification provided will only be able to be satisfied, or a claim will only be able to be pursued, solely against us and our assets outside the trust account and not against the any monies in the trust account or interest earned thereon.\n\nCertain Differences in Corporate Law\n\nCayman Islands companies are governed by the Companies Act. The Companies Act is modeled on English Law but does not follow recent English Law statutory enactments, and differs from laws applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. Set forth below is a summary of the material differences between the provisions of the Companies Act applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the United States and their shareholders.\n\n162\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nMergers and Similar Arrangements. In certain circumstances, the Companies Act allows for mergers or consolidations between two Cayman Islands companies, or between a Cayman Islands exempted company and a company incorporated in another jurisdiction (provided that is facilitated by the laws of that other jurisdiction).\n\nWhere the merger or consolidation is between two Cayman Islands companies, the directors of each company must approve a written plan of merger or consolidation containing certain prescribed information. That plan or merger or consolidation must then be authorized by (a) a special resolution (usually a majority of 66-2∕3% in value of the voting shares voted at a general meeting) of the shareholders of each company and (b) such other authorization, if any, as may be specified in such constituent company’s articles of association. No shareholder resolution is required for a merger between a parent company (i.e., a company that owns at least 90% of the issued shares of each class in a subsidiary company) and its subsidiary company. The consent of each holder of a fixed or floating security interest of a constituent company must be obtained, unless the court waives such requirement. If the Cayman Islands Registrar of Companies is satisfied that the requirements of the Companies Act (which includes certain other formalities) have been complied with, the Registrar of Companies will register the plan of merger or consolidation. Where the merger or consolidation involves a foreign company, the procedure is similar, save that with respect to the foreign company, the directors of the Cayman Islands exempted company are required to make a declaration to the effect that, having made due enquiry, they are of the opinion that the requirements set out below have been met: (i) that the merger or consolidation is permitted or not prohibited by the constitutional documents of the foreign company and by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the foreign company is incorporated, and that those laws and any requirements of those constitutional documents have been or will be complied with; (ii) that no petition or other similar proceeding has been filed and remains outstanding or order made or resolution adopted to wind up or liquidate the foreign company in any jurisdictions; (iii) that no receiver, trustee, administrator or other similar person has been appointed in any jurisdiction and is acting in respect of the foreign company, its affairs or its property or any part thereof; and (iv) that no scheme, order, compromise or other similar arrangement has been entered into or made in any jurisdiction whereby the rights of creditors of the foreign company are and continue to be suspended or restricted. Where the surviving company is the Cayman Islands exempted company, the directors of the Cayman Islands exempted company are further required to make a declaration to the effect that, having made due enquiry, they are of the opinion that the requirements set out below have been met: (i) that the foreign company is able to pay its debts as they fall due and that the merger or consolidated is bona fide and not intended to defraud unsecured creditors of the foreign company; (ii) that in respect of the transfer of any security interest granted by the foreign company to the surviving or consolidated company (a) consent or approval to the transfer has been obtained, released or waived, (b) the transfer is permitted by and has been approved in accordance with the constitutional documents of the foreign company, and (c) the laws of the jurisdiction of the foreign company with respect to the transfer have been or will be complied with; (iii) that the foreign company will, upon the merger or consolidation becoming effective, cease to be incorporated, registered or exist under the laws of the relevant foreign jurisdiction; and (iv) that there is no other reason why it would be against the public interest to permit the merger or consolidation.\n\nWhere the above procedures are adopted, the Companies Act provides for a right of dissenting shareholders to be paid a payment of the fair value of his shares upon their dissenting to the merger or consolidation if they follow a prescribed procedure. In essence, that procedure is as follows: (a) the shareholder must give his written objection to the merger or consolidation to the constituent company before the vote on the merger or consolidation, including a statement that the shareholder proposes to demand payment for his shares if the merger or consolidation is authorized by the vote; (b) within 20 days following the date on which the merger or consolidation is approved by the shareholders, the constituent company must give written notice to each shareholder who made a written objection; (c) a shareholder must within 20 days following receipt of such notice from the constituent company, give the constituent company a written notice of his intention to dissent including, among other details, a demand for payment of the fair value of his shares; (d) within seven days following the date of the expiration of the period set out in paragraph (b) above or seven days following the date on which the plan of merger or consolidation is filed, whichever is later, the constituent company, the surviving company or the consolidated company must make a written offer to each dissenting shareholder to purchase his shares at a price that the company determines is the fair value and if the company and the shareholder agree the price within 30 days following the date on which the offer was made, the company must pay the shareholder such amount; and (e) if the company and the shareholder fail to agree a price within such 30-day period, within 20 days following the date on which such 30-day period expires, the company (and any dissenting shareholder) must file a petition with the Cayman Islands Grand Court to determine the fair value and such petition must be accompanied by a list of the names and addresses of the dissenting shareholders with whom agreements as to the fair value of their shares have not been reached by the company. At the hearing of that petition, \n\n163\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nthe court has the power to determine the fair value of the shares together with a fair rate of interest, if any, to be paid by the company upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Any dissenting shareholder whose name appears on the list filed by the company may participate fully in all proceedings until the determination of fair value is reached. These rights of a dissenting shareholder are not available in certain circumstances, for example, to dissenters holding shares of any class in respect of which an open market exists on a recognized stock exchange or recognized interdealer quotation system at the relevant date or where the consideration for such shares to be contributed are shares of any company listed on a national securities exchange or shares of the surviving or consolidated company.\n\nMoreover, Cayman Islands law has separate statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction or amalgamation of companies in certain circumstances, schemes of arrangement will generally be more suited for complex mergers or other transactions involving widely held companies, commonly referred to in the Cayman Islands as a “scheme of arrangement” which may be tantamount to a merger. In the event that a merger was sought pursuant to a scheme of arrangement (the procedures for which are more rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures typically required to consummate a merger in the United States), the arrangement in question must be approved by a majority in number of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made and who must in addition represent three-fourths in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors, as the case may be, that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting, or meeting summoned for that purpose. The convening of the meetings and subsequently the terms of the arrangement must be sanctioned by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands. While a dissenting shareholder would have the right to express to the court the view that the transaction should not be approved, the court can be expected to approve the arrangement if it satisfies itself that:\n\n•| we are not proposing to act illegally or beyond the scope of our corporate authority and the statutory provisions as to majority vote have been complied with;  \n---|---  \n•| the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question;  \n---|---  \n•| the arrangement is such as a businessman would reasonably approve; and  \n---|---  \n•| the arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the Companies Act or that would amount to a “fraud on the minority.”  \n---|---  \n  \nIf a scheme of arrangement or takeover offer (as described below) is approved, any dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable to appraisal rights (providing rights to receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of the shares), which would otherwise ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of U.S. corporations.\n\nSqueeze-out Provisions. When a takeover offer is made and accepted by holders of 90% of the shares to whom the offer is made within four months, the offer or may, within a two-month period, require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such shares on the terms of the offer. An objection can be made to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, but this is unlikely to succeed unless there is evidence of fraud, bad faith, collusion or inequitable treatment of the shareholders.\n\nFurther, transactions similar to a merger, reconstruction and/or an amalgamation may in some circumstances be achieved through means other than these statutory provisions, such as a share capital exchange, asset acquisition or control, or through contractual arrangements of an operating business.\n\nShareholders’ Suits. Maples and Calder (Cayman) LLP, our Cayman Islands counsel, is not aware of any reported class action having been brought in a Cayman Islands court. Derivative actions have been brought in the Cayman Islands courts, and the Cayman Islands courts have confirmed the availability for such actions. In most cases, we will be the proper plaintiff in any claim based on a breach of duty owed to us, and a claim against (for example) our officers or directors usually may not be brought by a shareholder. However, based both on Cayman Islands authorities and on English authorities, which would in all likelihood be of persuasive authority and be applied by a court in the Cayman Islands, exceptions to the foregoing principle apply in circumstances in which:\n\n•| a company is acting, or proposing to act, illegally or beyond the scope of its authority;  \n---|---  \n•| the act complained of, although not beyond the scope of the authority, could be effected if duly authorized by more than the number of votes which have actually been obtained; or  \n---|---  \n•| those who control the company are perpetrating a “fraud on the minority.”  \n---|---  \n  \n164\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nA shareholder may have a direct right of action against us where the individual rights of that shareholder have been infringed or are about to be infringed.\n\nEnforcement of Civil Liabilities. The Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as compared to the United States and provides less protection to investors. Additionally, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to sue before the Federal courts of the United States.\n\nWe have been advised by Maples and Calder (Cayman) LLP, our Cayman Islands legal counsel, that the courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (i) to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state, and (ii) in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, and or be of a kind the enforcement of which is, contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy). A Cayman Islands Court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.\n\nSpecial Considerations for Exempted Companies. We are an exempted company with limited liability under the Companies Act. The Companies Act distinguishes between ordinary resident companies and exempted companies. Any company that is registered in the Cayman Islands but conducts business mainly outside of the Cayman Islands may apply to be registered as an exempted company. The requirements for an exempted company are essentially the same as for an ordinary company except for the exemptions and privileges listed below:\n\n•| an exempted company does not have to file an annual return of its shareholders with the Registrar of Companies;  \n---|---  \n•| an exempted company’s register of members is not open to inspection;  \n---|---  \n•| an exempted company does not have to hold an annual general meeting;  \n---|---  \n•| an exempted company may issue shares with no par value;  \n---|---  \n•| an exempted company may obtain an undertaking against the imposition of any future taxation (such undertakings are usually given for 20 years in the first instance);  \n---|---  \n•| an exempted company may register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the Cayman Islands;  \n---|---  \n•| an exempted company may register as a limited duration company; and  \n---|---  \n•| an exempted company may register as a segregated portfolio company.  \n---|---  \n  \n“Limited liability” means that the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount unpaid by the shareholder on the shares of the company (except in exceptional circumstances, such as involving fraud, the establishment of an agency relationship or an illegal or improper purpose or other circumstances in which a court may be prepared to pierce or lift the corporate veil).\n\nAmended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association\n\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will contain provisions designed to provide certain rights and protections relating to this offering that will apply to us until the completion of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without a special resolution. As a matter of Cayman Islands law, a resolution is deemed to be a special resolution under Cayman Islands law where it has been approved by either (i) the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (or any higher threshold specified in a company’s articles of association) of a company’s shareholders entitled to vote and so voting at a general meeting for which notice specifying the \n\n165\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nintention to propose the resolution as a special resolution has been given, or (ii) if so authorized by a company’s articles of association, by a unanimous written resolution of all of the company’s shareholders. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that special resolutions must be approved either by at least two-thirds of our shareholders (i.e., the lowest threshold permissible under Cayman Islands law), or by a unanimous written resolution of all of our shareholders.\n\nOur initial shareholders, who will collectively beneficially own 20% of our ordinary shares upon the closing of this offering (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering), will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. Specifically, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide, among other things, that:\n\n•| If we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case, to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law;  \n---|---  \n•| Prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote as a class with our public shares (a) on any initial business combination or (b) to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the time we have to consummate a business combination beyond 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering;  \n---|---  \n•| In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor or any of our founders, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such initial business combination or transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view;  \n---|---  \n•| If a shareholder vote on our initial business combination is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, we will offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, and will file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act;  \n---|---  \n•| We must consummate an initial business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in trust) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination;  \n---|---  \n•| If our shareholders approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (i) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, we will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of taxes paid or payable) divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein; and  \n---|---  \n  \n166\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\n•| We will not effectuate our initial business combination solely with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.  \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that under no circumstances will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon completion of our initial business combination.\n\nThe Companies Act permits a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands to amend its memorandum and articles of association with the approval of a special resolution which requires the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of such company’s issued and outstanding ordinary shares who attend and vote at a general meeting or by way of unanimous written resolution. A company’s articles of association may specify that the approval of a higher majority is required but, provided the approval of the required majority is obtained, any Cayman Islands exempted company may amend its memorandum and articles of association regardless of whether its memorandum and articles of association provides otherwise. Accordingly, although we could amend any of the provisions relating to our proposed offering, structure and business plan which are contained in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we view all of these provisions as binding obligations to our shareholders and neither we, nor our officers or directors, will take any action to amend or waive any of these provisions unless we provide dissenting public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares.\n\nAnti-Money Laundering — Cayman Islands\n\nIf any person in the Cayman Islands knows or suspects, or has reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting, that another person is engaged in criminal conduct or money laundering or is involved with terrorism or terrorist financing and property and the information for that knowledge or suspicion came to their attention in the course of business in the regulated sector or other trade, profession, business or employment, the person will be required to report such knowledge or suspicion to (i) the Financial Reporting Authority of the Cayman Islands, pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Law (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands if the disclosure relates to criminal conduct or money laundering or (ii) a police officer of the rank of constable or higher, or the Financial Reporting Authority, pursuant to the Terrorism Law (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands, if the disclosure relates to involvement with terrorism or terrorist financing and property. Such a report will not be treated as a breach of confidence or of any restriction upon the disclosure of information imposed by any enactment or otherwise.\n\nCayman Islands Data Protection\n\nWe have certain duties under the Data Protection Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands (the “DPA”) based on internationally accepted principles of data privacy.\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis privacy notice puts our shareholders on notice that through your investment in the company you will provide us with certain personal information which constitutes personal data within the meaning of the DPA (“personal data”).\n\nIn the following discussion, the “Company” refers to us and our affiliates and/or delegates, except where the context requires otherwise.\n\nInvestor Data\n\nWe will collect, use, disclose, retain and secure personal data to the extent reasonably required only and within the parameters that could be reasonably expected during the normal course of business. We will only process, disclose, transfer or retain personal data to the extent legitimately required to conduct our activities of on an ongoing basis or to comply with legal and regulatory obligations to which we are subject. We will only transfer personal data in accordance with the requirements of the DPA, and will apply appropriate technical and organizational information security measures designed to protect against unauthorized or unlawful processing of the personal data and against the accidental loss, destruction or damage to the personal data.\n\nIn our use of this personal data, we will be characterized as a “data controller” for the purposes of the DPA, while our affiliates and service providers who may receive this personal data from us in the conduct of our activities may either act as our “data processors” for the purposes of the DPA or may process personal information for their own lawful purposes in connection with services provided to us.\n\n167\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nWe may also obtain personal data from other public sources. Personal data includes, without limitation, the following information relating to a shareholder and/or any individuals connected with a shareholder as an investor: name, residential address, email address, contact details, corporate contact information, signature, nationality, place of birth, date of birth, tax identification, credit history, correspondence records, passport number, bank account details, source of funds details and details relating to the shareholder’s investment activity.\n\nWho This Affects\n\nIf you are a natural person, this will affect you directly. If you are a corporate investor (including, for these purposes, legal arrangements such as trusts or exempted limited partnerships) that provides us with personal data on individuals connected to you for any reason in relation your investment in the company, this will be relevant for those individuals and you should transmit the content of this Privacy Notice to such individuals or otherwise advise them of its content.\n\nHow the Company May Use a Shareholder’s Personal Data\n\nThe company, as the data controller, may collect, store and use personal data for lawful purposes, including, in particular:\n\n(i)| where this is necessary for the performance of our rights and obligations under any purchase agreements;  \n---|---  \n(ii)| where this is necessary for compliance with a legal and regulatory obligation to which we are subject (such as compliance with anti-money laundering and FATCA/CRS requirements); and/or  \n---|---  \n(iii)| where this is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests and such interests are not overridden by your interests, fundamental rights or freedoms.  \n---|---  \n  \nShould we wish to use personal data for other specific purposes (including, if applicable, any purpose that requires your consent), we will contact you.\n\nWhy We May Transfer Your Personal Data\n\nIn certain circumstances we may be legally obliged to share personal data and other information with respect to your shareholding with the relevant regulatory authorities such as the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority or the Tax Information Authority. They, in turn, may exchange this information with foreign authorities, including tax authorities.\n\nWe anticipates disclosing personal data to persons who provide services to us and their respective affiliates (which may include certain entities located outside the United States, the Cayman Islands or the European Economic Area), who will process your personal data on our behalf.\n\nThe Data Protection Measures We Take\n\nAny transfer of personal data by us or our duly authorized affiliates and/or delegates outside of the Cayman Islands shall be in accordance with the requirements of the DPA.\n\nWe and our duly authorized affiliates and/or delegates shall apply appropriate technical and organizational information security measures designed to protect against unauthorized or unlawful processing of personal data, and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data.\n\nWe shall notify you of any personal data breach that is reasonably likely to result in a risk to your interests, fundamental rights or freedoms or those data subjects to whom the relevant personal data relates.\n\nCertain Anti-Takeover Provisions of Our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association\n\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors and also include provisions providing for advance notice procedures, inability of shareholders to call a general meeting and removal of directors only for cause and only by the board of directors. As a result, in most circumstances, a person can gain control of our board only by successfully engaging in a proxy contest at two or more annual general meetings.\n\n168\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nIn addition, prior to our initial business combination, only holders of our Class B ordinary shares have the right to vote on the appointment of directors, including in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and holders of a majority of our Class B ordinary shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association relating to the rights of holders of Class B ordinary shares to appoint or remove directors prior to our initial business combination may only be amended by a special resolution which shall include the affirmative vote of a majority of our Class B ordinary shares.\n\nOur authorized but unissued Class A ordinary shares and preference shares are available for future issuances without shareholder approval and could be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future offerings to raise additional capital, acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved Class A ordinary shares and preference shares could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.\n\nSecurities Eligible for Future Sale\n\nImmediately after this offering we will have 18,750,000 (or 21,562,500 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) ordinary shares issued and outstanding. Of these shares, the Class A ordinary shares sold in this offering (15,000,000 Class A ordinary shares if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is not exercised and 17,250,000 shares if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, except for any Class A ordinary shares purchased by one of our affiliates within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. All of the outstanding founder shares (3,750,000 founder shares if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is not exercised and 4,312,500 founder shares if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) and all of the outstanding private placement warrants (7,750,000 warrants if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is not exercised and 8,650,000 warrants if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be restricted securities under Rule 144, in that they were issued in private transactions not involving a public offering. \n\nRule 144\n\nPursuant to Rule 144, a person who has beneficially owned restricted shares or warrants for at least six months would be entitled to sell their securities provided that (i) such person is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the three months preceding, a sale and (ii) we are subject to the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements for at least three months before the sale and have filed all required reports under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act during the 12 months (or such shorter period as we were required to file reports) preceding the sale.\n\nPersons who have beneficially owned restricted shares or warrants for at least six months but who are our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the three months preceding, a sale, would be subject to additional restrictions, by which such person would be entitled to sell within any three-month period only a number of securities that does not exceed the greater of:\n\n•| 1% of the total number of ordinary shares then issued and outstanding, which will equal 150,000 shares immediately after this offering (or 172,500 if the underwriter exercises in full its over-allotment option); or  \n---|---  \n•| the average weekly reported trading volume of the Class A ordinary shares during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to the sale.  \n---|---  \n  \nSales by our affiliates under Rule 144 are also limited by manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us.\n\nRestrictions on the Use of Rule 144 by Shell Companies or Former Shell Companies\n\nRule 144 is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by shell companies (other than business combination related shell companies) or issuers that have been at any time previously a shell company. However, Rule 144 also includes an important exception to this prohibition if the following conditions are met:\n\n•| the issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company;  \n---|---  \n•| the issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act;  \n---|---  \n  \n169\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\n•| the issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Form 8-K reports; and  \n---|---  \n•| at least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current Form 10 type information with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company.  \n---|---  \n  \nAs a result, our initial shareholders will be able to sell their founder shares and private placement warrants, as applicable, pursuant to Rule 144 without registration one year after we have completed our initial business combination.\n\nRegistration Rights\n\nThe holders of the founder shares, private placement warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans (and any Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the private placement warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be entered into on or prior to the closing of this offering. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our completion of our initial business combination. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\n\nListing of Securities\n\nWe have applied to have our units listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “BOCNU” commencing on or promptly after the date of this prospectus. We cannot guarantee that our securities will be approved for listing on Nasdaq. Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, we expect that the Class A ordinary shares and warrants will be listed on Nasdaq under the symbols “BOCN” and “BOCNW,” respectively. The units will automatically separate into their component parts and will not be traded following the completion of our initial business combination.\n\n170\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nTAXATION\n\nThe following summary of certain Cayman Islands and U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to an investment in our units, each consisting of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant, which we refer to collectively as our securities, is based upon laws and relevant interpretations thereof in effect as of the date of this prospectus, all of which are subject to change. This summary does not deal with all possible tax considerations relevant to an investment in our Class A ordinary shares and warrants, such as the tax consequences under state, local and other tax laws.\n\nProspective investors should consult their advisors on the possible tax consequences of investing in our securities under the laws of their country of citizenship, residence or domicile.\n\nCayman Islands Tax Considerations\n\nThe following is a discussion on certain Cayman Islands income tax consequences of an investment in the securities of the company. The discussion is a general summary of present law, which is subject to prospective and retroactive change. It is not intended as tax advice, does not consider any investor’s particular circumstances, and does not consider tax consequences other than those arising under Cayman Islands law.\n\nUnder Existing Cayman Islands Laws\n\nPayments of dividends and capital in respect of our securities will not be subject to taxation in the Cayman Islands and no withholding will be required on the payment of a dividend or capital to any holder of the securities nor will gains derived from the disposal of the securities be subject to Cayman Islands income or corporate tax. The Cayman Islands currently has no income, corporate or capital gains tax and no estate duty, inheritance tax or gift tax.\n\nNo stamp duty is payable in respect of the issue of the warrants. An instrument of transfer in respect of a warrant is stamp able if executed in or brought into the Cayman Islands.\n\nNo stamp duty is payable in respect of the issue of our Class A ordinary shares or on an instrument of transfer in respect of such shares.\n\nThe company has been incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability and, as such, has received an undertaking from the Financial Secretary of the Cayman Islands in the following form:\n\nThe Tax Concessions Law\n\nUndertaking as to Tax Concessions\n\nIn accordance with the Tax Concessions Law, the following undertaking is hereby given to Blue Ocean Acquisition Corp (the “Company”):\n\na)| That no Law which is hereafter enacted in the Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations shall apply to the company or its operations; and  \n---|---  \nb)| In addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall be payable  \n---|---  \n(i)| On or in respect of the shares, debentures or other obligations of the company; or  \n---|---  \n(ii)| by way of the withholding in whole or part, of any relevant payment as defined in Section 6(3) of the Tax Concessions Law.  \n---|---  \n  \nThese concessions shall be for a period of 20 years from 31 March 2021.\n\nUnited States Federal Income Tax Considerations\n\nGeneral\n\nThe following discussion summarizes certain U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our units (each consisting of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant) that are purchased in this offering by U.S. Holders (as defined below) and Non-U.S. Holders (as defined below). Because the components of a unit are generally separable at the option of the holder, the holder of a unit generally should be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as the owner of the underlying Class A \n\n171\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nordinary share and warrant components of the unit. As a result, the discussion below with respect to holders of Class A ordinary shares and warrants should also apply to holders of units (as the deemed owners of the underlying Class A ordinary shares and warrants that constitute the units).\n\nThis discussion is limited to certain U.S. federal income tax considerations to beneficial owners of our securities who are initial purchasers of a unit pursuant to this offering and hold the unit and each component of the unit as a capital asset under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).\n\nThis discussion assumes that the Class A ordinary shares and warrants will trade separately and that any distributions made (or deemed made) by us on our Class A ordinary shares and any consideration received (or deemed received) by a holder in consideration for the sale or other disposition of our securities will be in U.S. dollars. This discussion is general in nature and does not purport to be a complete description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of a unit by a prospective investor in light of its particular circumstance or status, or to prospective investors subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including:\n\n•| our sponsor, founders, officers, directors or holders of our Class B ordinary shares or private placement warrants;  \n---|---  \n•| banks, financial institutions or financial services entities;  \n---|---  \n•| broker-dealers;  \n---|---  \n•| taxpayers that are subject to the mark-to-market accounting rules;  \n---|---  \n•| tax-exempt entities;  \n---|---  \n•| S-corporations;  \n---|---  \n•| governments or agencies or instrumentalities thereof;  \n---|---  \n•| insurance companies;  \n---|---  \n•| regulated investment companies;  \n---|---  \n•| real estate investment trusts;  \n---|---  \n•| expatriates or former long-term residents of the United States;  \n---|---  \n•| persons that actually or constructively own five percent or more of our shares;  \n---|---  \n•| persons that acquired our securities pursuant to an exercise of employee share options, in connection with employee share incentive plans or otherwise as compensation or in connection with services;  \n---|---  \n•| persons that hold our securities as part of a straddle, constructive sale, hedging, conversion or other integrated or similar transaction; or  \n---|---  \n•| U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe discussion below is based upon the provisions of the Code, the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, all as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be repealed, revoked, modified or subject to differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis, so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below. Furthermore, this discussion does not address any aspect of U.S. federal non-income tax laws, such as gift, estate or Medicare contribution tax laws, or state, local or non-U.S. tax laws or considerations under any applicable income tax treaty.\n\nWe have not sought, and do not expect to seek, a ruling from the IRS as to any U.S. federal income tax consequence described herein. The IRS may disagree with the discussion herein, and its determination may be upheld by a court. Moreover, there can be no assurance that future legislation, regulations, administrative rulings or court decisions will not adversely affect the accuracy of the statements in this discussion.\n\nAs used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of units, Class A ordinary shares or warrants that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes: (i) an individual citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is created or organized (or treated as created or organized) in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an \n\n172\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nestate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if (A) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (B) it has in effect a valid election to be treated as a U.S. person.\n\nIf a beneficial owner of our securities is not described as a U.S. Holder and is not an entity treated as a partnership or other pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such owner will be considered a “Non-U.S. Holder.” The U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable specifically to Non-U.S. Holders are described below under the heading “Non-U.S. Holders.”\n\nThis discussion does not consider the tax treatment of partnerships or other pass-through entities or persons who hold our securities through such entities. If a partnership (or other entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is the beneficial owner of our securities, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. Partnerships holding our securities and partners in such partnerships should consult their own tax advisors.\n\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY, IS ONLY A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF OUR SECURITIES AND IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR CAREFUL TAX PLANNING. EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR IN OUR SECURITIES SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO SUCH INVESTOR OF THE ACQUISITION, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF OUR SECURITIES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND NON-U.S. TAX LAWS, AS WELL AS ANY APPLICABLE INCOME TAX TREATY.\n\nAllocation of Purchase Price and Characterization of a Unit\n\nNo statutory, administrative or judicial authority directly addresses the treatment of a unit or instruments similar to a unit for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and therefore, that treatment is not entirely clear. We intend to treat, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the acquisition of a unit as the acquisition of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one warrant, a whole one of which is exercisable to acquire one Class A ordinary share. By purchasing a unit, you agree to adopt such treatment for applicable tax purposes. As a result, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each holder of a unit must allocate the purchase price paid by such holder for such unit between the one Class A ordinary share and the one-half of one warrant based on the relative fair market value of each at the time of issuance. Under U.S. federal income tax law, each investor must make his or her own determination of such value based on all the relevant facts and circumstances, and should consult his or her tax adviser regarding the determination of value for these purposes. The price allocated to each Class A ordinary share and one-half of one warrant should constitute the shareholder’s initial tax basis in such share or one-half of one warrant. Any disposition of a unit should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a disposition of the Class A ordinary share and one-half of one warrant comprising the unit, and the amount realized on the disposition should be allocated between the Class A ordinary share and one-half of one warrant based on their respective relative fair market values at the time of disposition (as determined by the holder based on all relevant facts and circumstances). Neither the separation of the Class A ordinary share and the one-half of one warrant constituting a unit nor the combination of thirds of warrants into a single warrant should be a taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nThe foregoing treatment of the units, the Class A ordinary shares and warrants and a holder’s purchase price allocation are not binding on the IRS or the courts. Because there are no authorities that directly address instruments that are similar to the units, no assurance can be given that the IRS or the courts will agree with the characterization described above or the discussion below. Accordingly, each prospective investor should consult its tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of an investment in a unit (including alternative characterizations of a unit). The balance of this discussion assumes that the characterization of the units described above is respected for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nU.S. Holders\n\nTaxation of Distributions\n\nSubject to the PFIC rules discussed below, a U.S. Holder generally will be required to include in gross income as dividends the amount of any distribution paid on our Class A ordinary shares to the extent the distribution is paid \n\n173\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nout of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles). Such dividends paid by us will be taxable to a corporate U.S. Holder at the regular corporate rate and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to domestic corporations in respect of dividends received from other domestic corporations. Distributions in excess of such earnings and profits generally will be applied against and reduce the U.S. Holder’s basis in its Class A ordinary shares (but not below zero) and, to the extent in excess of such basis, will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such Class A ordinary shares (see “— Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants” below).\n\nWith respect to non-corporate U.S. Holders, dividends generally will be taxed at the lower applicable long-term capital gains rate (see “— Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants” below) only if our Class A ordinary shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States (such as the Nasdaq) and certain holding period and other requirements are met, including that the company is not treated as a PFIC during the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or in the preceding taxable year. It is unclear whether certain redemption rights described in this prospectus may suspend the running of the applicable holding period for this purpose. If the applicable holding period requirements are not satisfied, a non-corporate U.S. Holder may be subject to tax on the dividend at regular ordinary income tax rates instead of the preferential income tax rate that applies to qualified dividend income. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of such lower rate for any dividends paid with respect to our Class A ordinary shares.\n\nGain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants\n\nSubject to the PFIC rules discussed below, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss on the sale or other taxable disposition of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants (including on our dissolution and liquidation if we do not consummate an initial business combination within the required time period).\n\nAny such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for such Class A ordinary shares or warrants exceeds one year. It is unclear, however, whether certain redemption rights described in this prospectus may suspend the running of the applicable holding period for this purpose.\n\nThe amount of gain or loss recognized on a sale or other taxable disposition generally will be equal to the difference between (i) the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in such disposition (or, if the Class A ordinary shares or warrants are held as part of units at the time of the disposition, the portion of the amount realized on such disposition that is allocated to the Class A ordinary shares or warrants based upon the then relative fair market values of the Class A ordinary shares and the warrants included in the units) and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Class A ordinary shares or warrants so disposed of. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Class A ordinary shares or warrants generally will equal the U.S. Holder’s acquisition cost (that is, the portion of the purchase price of a unit allocated to one Class A ordinary share or one-half of one warrant, as described above under “— Allocation of Purchase Price and Characterization of a Unit”) reduced, in the case of Class A ordinary shares, by any prior distributions treated as a return of capital. Long-term capital gain realized by a non-corporate U.S. Holder is currently eligible to be taxed at reduced rates. See “— Exercise, Lapse or Redemption of a Warrant” below for a discussion regarding a U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Class A ordinary share acquired pursuant to the exercise of a warrant. The deduction of capital losses is subject to certain limitations. A U.S. Holder should consult with its own tax advisors as to the allocation of remaining tax basis.\n\nRedemption of Class A Ordinary Shares\n\nSubject to the PFIC rules discussed below, in the event that a U.S. Holder’s Class A ordinary shares are redeemed pursuant to the redemption provisions described in this prospectus under “Description of Securities — Ordinary Shares” or if we purchase a U.S. Holder’s Class A ordinary shares in an open market transaction (referred to herein as a redemption), the treatment of the redemption for U.S. federal income tax purposes will depend on whether it qualifies as sale of the Class A ordinary shares under Section 302 of the Code. If the redemption qualifies as a sale of Class A ordinary shares, the U.S. Holder will be treated as described under “— Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants” above. If the redemption does not qualify as a sale of Class A ordinary shares, the U.S. Holder will be treated as receiving a corporate distribution with the tax consequences described above under “— Taxation of Distributions.” Whether a redemption qualifies for sale treatment will depend largely on the total number of our shares treated as held by the U.S. Holder (including any shares constructively owned by the U.S. Holder as described in the following paragraph) \n\n174\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nrelative to all of our shares issued and outstanding both before and after such redemption. The redemption of Class A ordinary shares generally will be treated as a sale of the Class A ordinary shares (rather than as a distribution) if such redemption (i) is “substantially disproportionate” with respect to the U.S. Holder, (ii) results in a “complete termination” of the U.S. Holder’s interest in us or (iii) is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to the U.S. Holder. These tests are explained more fully below.\n\nIn determining whether any of the foregoing tests are satisfied, a U.S. Holder takes into account not only our Class A Ordinary shares actually owned by the U.S. Holder, but also our shares that are constructively owned by it. A U.S. Holder may constructively own, in addition to shares owned directly, shares owned by certain related individuals and entities in which the U.S. Holder has an interest or that have an interest in such U.S. Holder, as well as any shares the U.S. Holder has a right to acquire by exercise of an option, which would generally include Class A ordinary shares which could be acquired pursuant to the exercise of the warrants. In order to meet the substantially disproportionate test, the percentage of our issued and outstanding voting shares actually and constructively owned by the U.S. Holder immediately following the redemption of Class A ordinary shares must, among other requirements, be less than 80 percent of the percentage of our issued and outstanding voting shares actually and constructively owned by the U.S. Holder immediately before the redemption. Prior to our initial business combination, the Class A ordinary shares may not be treated as voting shares for this purpose and, consequently, this substantially disproportionate test may not be applicable. There will be a complete termination of a U.S. Holder’s interest if either (i) all of our shares actually and constructively owned by the U.S. Holder are redeemed or (ii) all of our shares actually owned by the U.S. Holder are redeemed and the U.S. Holder is eligible to waive, and effectively waives in accordance with specific rules, the attribution of shares owned by certain family members and the U.S. Holder does not constructively own any other shares of ours. The redemption of the Class A ordinary shares will not be essentially equivalent to a dividend with respect to a U.S. Holder if it results in a “meaningful reduction” of the U.S. Holder’s proportionate interest in us. Whether the redemption will result in a meaningful reduction in a U.S. Holder’s proportionate interest in us will depend on the particular facts and circumstances. However, the IRS has indicated in a published ruling that even a small reduction in the proportionate interest of a small minority shareholder in a publicly held corporation who exercises no control over corporate affairs may constitute such a “meaningful reduction.” A U.S. Holder should consult with its own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of a redemption.\n\nIf none of the foregoing tests are satisfied, then the redemption may be treated as a corporate distribution and the tax effects will be as described under “— Taxation of Distributions” above. After the application of those rules, any remaining tax basis of the U.S. Holder in the redeemed Class A ordinary shares will be added to the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its remaining shares, or, if it has none, to the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its warrants or possibly in other shares constructively owned by it. A U.S. Holder should consult with its own tax advisors as to the allocation of remaining tax basis.\n\nExercise, Lapse or Redemption of a Warrant\n\nSubject to the PFIC rules discussed below and except as discussed below with respect to the cashless exercise of a warrant, a U.S. Holder generally will not recognize gain or loss upon the acquisition of a Class A ordinary share on the exercise of a warrant for cash. A U.S. Holder’s initial tax basis in a Class A ordinary share received upon exercise of the warrant generally will equal the sum of the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the warrant (as described above under “— Allocation of Purchase Price and Characterization of a Unit”) and the exercise price. It is unclear whether a U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Class A ordinary share will commence on the date of exercise of the warrant or the day following the date of exercise of the warrant; in either case, the holding period will not include the period during which the U.S. Holder held the warrant. If a warrant is allowed to lapse unexercised, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize a capital loss equal to such holder’s tax basis in the warrant.\n\nThe tax consequences of a cashless exercise of a warrant are not clear under current law. Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below, a cashless exercise may not be taxable, either because the exercise is not a realization event or because the exercise is treated as a “recapitalization” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In either situation, a U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Class A ordinary shares received generally would equal the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the warrants. If the cashless exercise was not a realization event, it is unclear whether a U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Class A ordinary share will commence on the date of exercise of the warrant or the day following the date of exercise of the warrant. If the cashless exercise were treated as a recapitalization, the holding period of the Class A ordinary shares would include the holding period of the warrants.\n\n175\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nIt is also possible that a cashless exercise may be treated as a taxable exchange in which gain or loss would be recognized. In such event, a U.S. Holder may be deemed to have surrendered a number of warrants having a value equal to the exercise price for the total number of warrants to be exercised. Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below, the U.S. Holder would recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the warrants deemed surrendered and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in such warrants. In this case, a U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Class A ordinary shares received would equal the sum of the U.S. Holder’s initial investment in the warrants exercised (i.e., the portion of the U.S. Holder’s purchase price for the units that is allocated to the warrant, as described above under “— Allocation of Purchase Price and Characterization of a Unit”) and the exercise price of such warrants. It is unclear whether a U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Class A ordinary share would commence on the date of exercise of the warrant or the day following the date of exercise of the warrant.\n\nDue to the absence of authority on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a cashless exercise, there can be no assurance which, if any, of the alternative tax consequences and holding periods described above would be adopted by the IRS or a court of law. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder should consult its tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of a cashless exercise.\n\nSubject to the PFIC rules described below, if we redeem warrants for cash pursuant to the redemption provisions described in the section of this prospectus entitled “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants” or if we purchase warrants in an open market transaction, such redemption or purchase generally will be treated as a taxable disposition to the U.S. Holder, taxed as described above under “— Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants.”\n\nPossible Constructive Distributions\n\nThe terms of each warrant provide for an adjustment to the number of Class A ordinary shares for which the warrant may be exercised or to the exercise price of the warrant in certain events, as discussed in the section of this prospectus captioned “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants.” An adjustment which has the effect of preventing dilution generally is not taxable. The U.S. Holders of the warrants would, however, be treated as receiving a constructive distribution from us if, for example, the adjustment increases such U.S. Holders’ proportionate interest in our assets or earnings and profits (e.g., through an increase in the number of Class A ordinary shares that would be obtained upon exercise or through a decrease to the exercise price) as a result of a distribution of cash or other property to the holders of our Class A ordinary shares which is taxable to the U.S. Holders of such Class A ordinary shares as described under “— Taxation of Distributions” above. Such constructive distribution would be subject to tax as described under that section in the same manner as if the U.S. Holders of the warrants received a cash distribution from us equal to the fair market value of such increased interest.\n\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Rules\n\nA foreign (i.e., non-U.S.) corporation will be classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes if either (i) at least 75% of its gross income in a taxable year, including its pro rata share of the gross income of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by value, is passive income or (ii) at least 50% of its assets in a taxable year (ordinarily determined based on fair market value and averaged quarterly over the year), including its pro rata share of the assets of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by value, are held for the production of, or produce, passive income. Passive income generally includes dividends, interest, rents and royalties (other than rents or royalties derived from the active conduct of a trade or business) and gains from the disposition of passive assets.\n\nBecause we are a blank check company, with no current active business, we believe that it is likely that we will meet the PFIC asset or income test during the taxable years prior to our acquisition of a company or assets in a business combination (including any short taxable year that might result from a business combination), which would generally result in us being treated as a PFIC in those taxable years. However, pursuant to a start-up exception, a corporation will not be a PFIC for the first taxable year the corporation has gross income (the “start-up year”), if (i) no predecessor of the corporation was a PFIC; (ii) the corporation satisfies the IRS that it will not be a PFIC for either of the two taxable years following the start-up year; and (iii) the corporation is not in fact a PFIC for either of those years. The applicability of the start-up exception to us is uncertain and will not be known until after the close of our current taxable year (or possibly not until after the close of the first two taxable years following our start-up year, as described under the start-up exception). Therefore, we cannot assure you that we will qualify for the start-up exception. Furthermore, we could meet the PFIC asset or income test following our start-up year, and whether we \n\n176\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\ndo so may depend on, among other things, the timing of our business combination, the amount of our passive income and assets in the year of the business combination, and the amount of passive income and assets of the acquired business. In such case, we would be treated as a PFIC in those taxable years (and likely would not qualify for the start-up exception). Our actual PFIC status for our current taxable year or any subsequent taxable year, however, will not be determinable until after the end of such taxable year. Accordingly, there can be no assurance with respect to our status as a PFIC for our current taxable year or any future taxable year.\n\nAlthough our PFIC status is determined annually, an initial determination that our company is a PFIC will generally apply for subsequent years to a U.S. Holder who held Class A ordinary shares or warrants while we were a PFIC, whether or not we meet the test for PFIC status in those subsequent years. If we are determined to be a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. Holder of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants and, in the case of our Class A ordinary shares, the U.S. Holder did not make either a qualified electing fund (“QEF”) election or a mark-to-market election for our first taxable year as a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder held (or was deemed to hold) Class A ordinary shares, as described below, such U.S. Holder generally will be subject to special rules with respect to (i) any gain recognized by the U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of its Class A ordinary shares or warrants and (ii) any “excess distribution” made to the U.S. Holder (generally, any distributions to such U.S. Holder during a taxable year of the U.S. Holder, other than the taxable year in which the U.S. Holder’s holding period in the Class A ordinary shares begins that are greater than 125% of the average annual distributions received by such U.S. Holder in respect of the Class A ordinary shares during the three preceding taxable years of such U.S. Holder or, if shorter, the portion of such U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Class A ordinary shares before the current taxable year).\n\nUnder these rules:\n\n•| the U.S. Holder’s gain or excess distribution will be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Class A ordinary shares or warrants;  \n---|---  \n•| the amount allocated to the U.S. Holder’s taxable year in which the U.S. Holder recognized the gain or received the excess distribution, or to the period in the U.S. Holder’s holding period before the first day of our first taxable year in which we are a PFIC, will be taxed as ordinary income;  \n---|---  \n•| the amount allocated to other taxable years (or portions thereof) of the U.S. Holder and included in its holding period will be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for that year and applicable to the U.S. Holder; and  \n---|---  \n•| an additional tax equal to the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed on the U.S. Holder with respect to the tax attributable to each such other taxable year of the U.S. Holder.  \n---|---  \n  \nIn general, if we are determined to be a PFIC, a U.S. Holder may avoid the PFIC tax consequences described above in respect of our Class A ordinary shares (but not our warrants) by making a timely and valid QEF election (if eligible to do so) in the first taxable year in which the U.S. Holder held (or was deemed to hold) Class A ordinary shares in which we are classified as a PFIC. If a U.S. Holder makes a timely QEF election with respect to our Class A ordinary shares, each year such U.S. Holder will be required to include in income its pro rata share of our net capital gains (as long-term capital gain) and other earnings and profits (as ordinary income) for our taxable year that ends with or within the taxable year of the U.S. Holder, regardless of whether or not we make distributions to such U.S. Holder. A U.S. Holder generally may make a separate election to defer the payment of taxes on undistributed income inclusions under the QEF rules, but if deferred, any such taxes will be subject to an interest charge.\n\nA U.S. Holder may not make a QEF election with respect to its warrants to acquire our Class A ordinary shares. As a result, if a U.S. Holder sells or otherwise disposes of such warrants (other than upon exercise of such warrants) and we were a PFIC at any time during the U.S. Holder’s holding period of such warrants, any gain recognized generally will be treated as an excess distribution, taxed as described above. If a U.S. Holder that exercises such warrants properly makes a QEF election with respect to the newly acquired Class A ordinary shares (or has previously made a QEF election with respect to our Class A ordinary shares), the QEF election will apply to the newly acquired Class A ordinary shares. Notwithstanding such QEF election, the adverse tax consequences relating to PFIC shares, adjusted to take into account the current income inclusions resulting from the QEF election, will continue to apply with respect to such newly acquired Class A ordinary shares (which generally will be deemed to have a holding period for purposes of the PFIC rules that includes the period the U.S. Holder held the warrants), unless the U.S. Holder makes a purging election under the PFIC rules. Under one type of purging election, the U.S. Holder is deemed to have \n\n177\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nsold such shares at their fair market value and any gain recognized on such deemed sale will be treated as an excess distribution, as described above. As a result of the purging election, the U.S. Holder will have a new basis and holding period in the Class A ordinary shares acquired upon the exercise of the warrants for purposes of the PFIC rules. A U.S. Holder should consult with its own tax advisors as to the application of the rules governing purging elections to its particular circumstances.\n\nThe QEF election is made on a shareholder-by-shareholder basis and, once made, can be revoked only with the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder generally makes a QEF election by attaching a completed IRS Form 8621 (Information Return by a Shareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company or Qualified Electing Fund), including the information provided in a PFIC annual information statement (discussed below), to a timely filed U.S. federal income tax return for the tax year to which the election relates. Retroactive QEF elections generally may be made only by filing a protective statement with such return and if certain other conditions are met or with the consent of the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability and tax consequences of a retroactive QEF election under their particular circumstances.\n\nIn order to comply with the requirements of a QEF election, a U.S. Holder must receive a PFIC annual information statement from us. If we determine we are a PFIC for any taxable year, upon written request, we will endeavor to provide to a U.S. Holder such information as the IRS may require, including a PFIC annual information statement, in order to enable the U.S. Holder to make and maintain a QEF election, but there is no assurance that we will timely provide such required information. There is also no assurance that we will have timely knowledge of our status as a PFIC in the future or of the required information to be provided.\n\nIf a U.S. Holder has made a QEF election with respect to our Class A ordinary shares, and the excess distribution rules discussed above do not apply to such shares (because of a timely QEF election for our first taxable year as a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) such shares or a purge of the PFIC taint pursuant to a purging election, as described above), any gain recognized on the sale of our Class A ordinary shares generally will be taxable as capital gain and no additional interest charge will be imposed under the PFIC rules. As discussed above, if we are a PFIC for any taxable year, a U.S. Holder of our Class A ordinary shares that has made a QEF election will be currently taxed on its pro rata share of our earnings and profits, whether or not distributed for such year. A subsequent distribution of such earnings and profits that were previously included in income generally should not be taxable when distributed to such U.S. Holder. The tax basis of a U.S. Holder’s Class A ordinary shares will be increased by amounts that are included in income, and decreased by amounts distributed but not taxed as dividends, under the above rules. In addition, if we are not a PFIC for any taxable year, such U.S. Holder will not be subject to the QEF inclusion regime with respect to our Class A ordinary shares for such taxable year.\n\nAlternatively, if we are a PFIC and our Class A ordinary shares constitute “marketable stock,” a U.S. Holder may avoid the adverse PFIC tax consequences discussed above if such U.S. Holder, at the close of the first taxable year in which it holds (or is deemed to hold) our Class A ordinary shares, makes a mark-to-market election with respect to such shares for such taxable year. Such U.S. Holder generally will include for each of its taxable years as ordinary income the excess, if any, of the fair market value of its Class A ordinary shares at the end of such year over its adjusted basis in its Class A ordinary shares. The U.S. Holder also will recognize an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of its adjusted basis of its Class A ordinary shares over the fair market value of its Class A ordinary shares at the end of its taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of the mark-to-market election). The U.S. Holder’s basis in its Class A ordinary shares will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts, and any further gain recognized on a sale or other taxable disposition of its Class A ordinary shares will be treated as ordinary income. Any loss recognized on a sale or other taxable disposition of the Class A ordinary shares will be treated as ordinary loss to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of the mark-to-market election and thereafter as capital loss. Currently, a mark-to-market election may not be made with respect to warrants.\n\nThe mark-to-market election is available only for “marketable stock,” generally, stock that is regularly traded on a national securities exchange that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Nasdaq (on which we intend to list the Class A ordinary shares), or on a foreign exchange or market that the IRS determines has rules sufficient to ensure that the market price represents a legitimate and sound fair market value. If made, a mark-to-market election would be effective for the taxable year for which the election was made and for \n\n178\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nall subsequent taxable years unless the ordinary shares ceased to qualify as “marketable stock” for purposes of the PFIC rules or the IRS consented to the revocation of the election. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability and tax consequences of a mark-to-market election with respect to our Class A ordinary shares under their particular circumstances.\n\nIf we are a PFIC and, at any time, have a foreign subsidiary that is classified as a PFIC (a “lower-tier PFIC”), U.S. Holders generally would be deemed to own a portion of the shares of such lower-tier PFIC, and generally could incur liability for the deferred tax and interest charge described above if we receive a distribution from, or dispose of all or part of our interest in, the lower-tier PFIC or the U.S. Holders otherwise were deemed to have disposed of an interest in the lower-tier PFIC. We will endeavor to cause any lower-tier PFIC to provide to a U.S. Holder the information that may be required to make or maintain a QEF election with respect to the lower-tier PFIC. There can be no assurance that we will have timely knowledge of the status of any such lower-tier PFIC. In addition, we may not hold a controlling interest in any such lower-tier PFIC and thus there can be no assurance we will be able to cause the lower-tier PFIC to provide such required information. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax issues raised by lower-tier PFICs.\n\nA U.S. Holder that owns (or is deemed to own) shares in a PFIC during any taxable year of the U.S. Holder, may have to file an IRS Form 8621 (whether or not a QEF or mark-to-market election is made) and such other information as may be required by the U.S. Treasury Department. Failure to do so, if required, will extend the statute of limitations until such required information is furnished to the IRS.\n\nThe rules dealing with PFICs and with the QEF and mark-to-market elections are very complex and are affected by various factors in addition to those described above. Accordingly, U.S. Holders of our Class A ordinary shares and warrants should consult their own tax advisors concerning the application of the PFIC rules to our securities under their particular circumstances.\n\nTax Reporting\n\nCertain U.S. Holders may be required to file an IRS Form 926 (Return by a U.S. Transferor of Property to a Foreign Corporation) to report a transfer of property (including cash) to us. Substantial penalties may be imposed on a U.S. Holder that fails to comply with this reporting requirement and the period of limitations for assessment and collection of U.S. federal income taxes will be extended in the event of a failure to comply. Furthermore, certain U.S. Holders who are individuals and certain entities will be required to report information with respect to such U.S. Holder’s investment in “specified foreign financial assets” on IRS Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets), subject to certain exceptions. An interest in the company constitutes a specified foreign financial asset for these purposes. Persons who are required to report specified foreign financial assets and fail to do so may be subject to substantial penalties and the period of limitations for assessment and collection of U.S. federal income taxes will be extended in the event of a failure to comply. Potential investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the foreign financial asset and other reporting obligations and their application to an investment in our Class A ordinary shares and warrants.\n\nNon-U.S. Holders\n\nThis section applies to you if you are a “Non-U.S. Holder.” As used herein, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of our units, Class A ordinary shares or warrants (other than a partnership or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) who or that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\n•| a non-resident alien individual (other than certain former citizens and residents of the United States subject to U.S. tax as expatriates);  \n---|---  \n•| a foreign corporation; or  \n---|---  \n•| an estate or trust that is not a U.S. Holder;  \n---|---  \n  \nbut generally does not include an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition. If you are such an individual, you should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the sale or other disposition of our securities.\n\nDividends (including constructive dividends) paid or deemed paid to a Non-U.S. Holder in respect of our Class A ordinary shares generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, unless the dividends are effectively \n\n179\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nconnected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, are attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base that such holder maintains in the United States). In addition, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain attributable to a sale or other disposition of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants unless such gain is effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base that such holder maintains in the United States).\n\nDividends (including constructive dividends) and gains that are effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, are attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base in the United States) generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the same regular U.S. federal income tax rates applicable to a comparable U.S. Holder and, in the case of a Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate or a lower applicable income tax treaty rate.\n\nThe characterization for U.S. federal income tax purposes of the redemption of a Non-U.S. Holder’s Class A ordinary shares pursuant to the redemption provisions described in this prospectus under “Description of Securities — Ordinary Shares” or if we purchase your Class A ordinary shares in an open-market transaction generally will correspond to the U.S. federal income tax characterization of such a redemption of a U.S. Holder’s Class A ordinary shares, as described under “—U.S. Holders—Redemption of Class A Ordinary Shares” above, and the consequences of the redemption or repurchase to the Non-U.S. Holder generally will correspond to those described in the preceding paragraphs above regarding dividends and gain on the sale or other disposition of our Class A ordinary shares accordingly.\n\nThe U.S. federal income tax treatment of the receipt of a Class A ordinary share upon the exercise of a warrant generally will correspond to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the receipt of a Class A ordinary share on exercise of a warrant by a U.S. Holder, as described under “—U.S. Holders— Exercise, Lapse or Redemption of a Warrant,” above, although to the extent a cashless exercise results in a taxable exchange, the consequences would be similar to those described in the preceding paragraphs above regarding gain on the sale or other disposition of a warrant. The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a redemption of warrants for cash pursuant to the redemption provisions described in the section of this prospectus entitled “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants” or if we purchase warrants in an open-market transaction, such redemption or purchase will generally correspond to those described in the preceding paragraphs above regarding gain on the sale or other disposition of our warrants.\n\n180\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nUNDERWRITING\n\nNeedham & Company, LLC is acting as the sole book running manager and underwriter of this offering. Subject to the terms and conditions of the underwriting agreement dated the date of this prospectus, the underwriter has agreed to purchase from us, and we have agreed to sell to the underwriter, the 15,000,000 units offered hereby.\n\nThe underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the underwriter to purchase the units included in this offering are subject to approval of legal matters by counsel and to other conditions. The underwriter is obligated to purchase all of the units (other than those covered by the underwriter’s over-allotment option described below) if they purchase any of the units.\n\nUnits sold by the underwriter to the public will initially be offered at the initial public offering price set forth on the cover of this prospectus. If all of the units are not sold at the initial offering price, the underwriter may change the public offering price and the other selling terms. The underwriter has advised us that the underwriter does not intend to make sales to discretionary accounts.\n\nIf the underwriter sells more units than the total number set forth in the table above, we have granted to the underwriter an option, exercisable for 45 days from the date of this prospectus, to purchase up to 2,250,000 additional units at the public offering price less the underwriting discount. Any units issued or sold under the option will be issued and sold on the same terms and conditions as the other units that are the subject of this offering.\n\nWe, our sponsor and our officers and directors have agreed that, for a period of 180 days from the date of this prospectus, we and they will not, without the prior written consent of Needham & Company, LLC, offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any units, warrants, Class A ordinary shares or any other securities convertible into, or exercisable, or exchangeable for, Class A ordinary shares; provided, however, that we may (i) issue and sell the private placement warrants, (ii) issue and sell the additional units to cover our underwriter’s over-allotment option (if any), (iii) register with the SEC pursuant to an agreement to be entered into concurrently with the issuance and sale of the securities in this offering, the resale of the founder shares and the private placement warrants or the warrants and Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and (iv) issue securities in connection with an initial business combination. However, the foregoing shall not apply to the forfeiture of any founder shares pursuant to their terms or any transfer of founder shares to any current or future independent director of the company (as long as such current or future independent director is subject to the terms of the letter agreement, filed herewith, at the time of such transfer; and as long as, to the extent any Section 16 reporting obligation is triggered as a result of such transfer, any related Section 16 filing includes a practical explanation as to the nature of the transfer). Needham & Company, LLC in its sole discretion may release any of the securities subject to these lock-up agreements at any time without notice.\n\nOur initial shareholders have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their (i) founder shares until the earlier to occur of: (a) one year after the completion of our initial business combination; and (b) subsequent to our initial business combination (x) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property or (y) if the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and other similar transactions) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination (except as described in the section entitled “Principal Shareholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants”) and (ii) private placement warrants (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants) until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination (except with respect to permitted transferees as described herein under “Principal Shareholders – Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants”). Any permitted transferees will be subject to the same restrictions and other agreements of our initial shareholders with respect to any founder shares and private placement warrants, as applicable. \n\nPrior to this offering, there has been no public market for our securities. Consequently, the initial public offering price for the units was determined by negotiations between us and the underwriter.\n\nThe determination of our per unit offering price was more arbitrary than would typically be the case if we were an operating company. Among the factors considered in determining initial public offering price were the history and prospects of companies whose principal business is the acquisition of other companies, prior offerings of those companies, our management, our capital structure, and currently prevailing general conditions in equity securities markets, including current market valuations of publicly traded companies considered comparable to our company. \n\n181\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nWe cannot assure you, however, that the price at which the units, Class A ordinary shares or warrants will sell in the public market after this offering will not be lower than the initial public offering price or that an active trading market in our units, Class A ordinary shares or warrants will develop and continue after this offering.\n\nWe have applied to have our units listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “BOCNU” commencing on or promptly after the date of this prospectus. Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, we expect that the Class A ordinary shares and warrants will be listed on Nasdaq under the symbols “BOCN” and “BOCNW” respectively.\n\nThe following table shows the underwriting discounts and commissions that we are to pay to the underwriter in connection with this offering. These amounts are shown assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option.\n\n​| ​| Paid by us  \n---|---|---  \n​| ​| No Exercise| ​| ​| Full Exercise  \nPer Unit(1)| ​| ​| $0.55| ​| ​| $0.55  \nTotal(1)| ​| ​| $8,250,000| ​| ​| $9,487,500  \n(1)| $0.20 per unit, or $3,000,000 in the aggregate (or $3,450,000 in the aggregate if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full), is payable upon the closing of this offering. Includes $0.35 per unit, or $5,250,000 in the aggregate (or $6,037,500 in the aggregate if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) payable to the underwriter for deferred underwriting commissions will be placed in a trust account located in the United States as described herein. The deferred commissions will be released to the underwriter only on and concurrently with completion of an initial business combination. Up to $0.0525 per unit, or up to $787,500 (or $905,625 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full), of such amount may instead be paid, at our sole discretion, to third parties not participating in this offering (but are FINRA members) that assist us in consummating our initial business combination.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe underwriter may offer and sell the units through one or more of its respective affiliates or other registered broker-dealers or selling agents. The offering of the shares by the underwriter is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the underwriter’s right to reject any order in whole or in part.\n\nIf we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of this offering, the underwriter has agreed that (i) it will forfeit any rights or claims to their deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, including any accrued interest thereon, then in the trust account and (ii) that the deferred underwriter’s discounts and commissions will be distributed on a pro rata basis, together with any accrued interest thereon (which interest will be net of taxes paid or payable) to the public shareholders.\n\nIn connection with the offering, the underwriter may purchase and sell units in the open market. Purchases and sales in the open market may include short sales, purchases to cover short positions, which may include purchases pursuant to the underwriter’s over-allotment option, and stabilizing purchases.\n\n•| Short sales involve secondary market sales by the underwriter of a greater number of units than it is required to purchase in the offering.  \n---|---  \n•| “Covered” short sales are sales of units in an amount up to the number of units represented by the underwriter’s over-allotment option.  \n---|---  \n•| “Naked” short sales are sales of units in an amount in excess of the number of units represented by the underwriter’s over-allotment option.  \n---|---  \n•| Covering transactions involve purchases of units either pursuant to the underwriter’s over-allotment option or in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions.  \n---|---  \n•| To close a naked short position, the underwriter must purchase units in the open market after the distribution has been completed. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriter is concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the units in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.  \n---|---  \n•| To close a covered short position, the underwriter must purchase units in the open market after the distribution has been completed or must exercise the underwriter’s over-allotment option. In determining the source of units to close the covered short position, the underwriter will consider, among other things, the price of units available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase units through the underwriter’s over-allotment option.  \n---|---  \n  \n182\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\n•| Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase units so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum.  \n---|---  \n  \nPurchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases, as well as other purchases by the underwriter for its own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the units. They may also cause the price of the units to be higher than the price that would otherwise exist in the open market in the absence of these transactions. The underwriter may conduct these transactions in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. If the underwriter commences any of these transactions, it may discontinue them at any time.\n\nWe estimate that the total expenses of this offering payable by us will be $627,366, excluding underwriting discounts and commissions. The underwriter has agreed to reimburse us for $500,000 of these expenses. We have agreed to pay for the FINRA-related fees and expenses of the underwriter’s legal counsel (such underwriter’s expenses not to exceed $20,000). We have also agreed to indemnify the underwriter against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the underwriter may be required to make because of any of those liabilities. \n\nWe are not under any contractual obligation to engage the underwriter to provide any services for us after this offering, but we may do so at our discretion. However, the underwriter may introduce us to potential target businesses provide financial advisory services to us in connection with a business combination or assist us in raising additional capital in the future including by acting as a placement agent in a private offering or underwriting or arranging debt financing. If the underwriter provides services to us after this offering, we may pay the underwriter’s fair and reasonable fees that would be determined at that time in an arm’s length negotiation; provided that no agreement will be entered into with the underwriter and no fees for such services will be paid to the underwriter prior to the date that is 60 days from the date of this prospectus, unless FINRA determines that such payment would not be deemed underwriter’s compensation in connection with this offering and we may pay the underwriter of this offering or any entity with which it is affiliated a finder’s fee or other compensation for services rendered to us in connection with the completion of a business combination. Any fees we may pay the underwriter or its affiliates for services rendered to us after this offering may be contingent on the completion of a business combination and may be paid in other than cash. The underwriter or its affiliates that provide these services to us may have a potential conflict of interest given that the underwriter is entitled to the deferred portion of their underwriting compensation for this offering only if an initial business combination is completed within the specified timeframe.\n\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the underwriter and its affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. The underwriter and its affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.\n\nWe have agreed to offer to engage Needham & Company, LLC as our lead book-running managing underwriter, lead book-running placement agent or lead arranger, as the case may be, in connection with any public offering or private placement of our securities or any debt financing relating to or in connection with our initial business combination, on substantially similar economic terms as this offering. In accordance with FINRA Rule 5110(g)(6)(A), this right shall not have a duration of more than three years from the initial closing of this offering. The terms of any such engagement will be set forth in a separate agreement between us and Needham & Company, LLC, and will contain terms and conditions that are customary for investment banks for similar transactions.\n\nNotice to Prospective Investors in Canada\n\nThe units may be sold only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal that are accredited investors, as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), and are permitted clients, as defined in National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations.

(the “Company”) as of April 9, 2021, the related statements of operations, shareholder’s equity and cash flows for the period from March 26, 2021 (inception) through April 9, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 9, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from March 26, 2021 (inception) through April 9, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nExplanatory Paragraph – Going Concern \n\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company’s business plan is dependent upon its completion of the proposed initial public offering described in Note 3 to the financial statements. The Company has a working capital deficiency as of April 9, 2021, and lacks the financial resources it needs to sustain operations for a reasonable amount of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of the financial statements. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans with regard to these matters are also described in Notes 1 and 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. \n\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n/s/ Marcum LLP\n\nMarcum LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021.\n\nNew York, NY\n\nJuly 23, 2021\n\nF-2\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nBLUE OCEAN ACQUISITION CORP \n\nBALANCE SHEETS\n\n​| ​| June 30, 2021| ​| ​| April 9, 2021  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| (Unaudited)| ​| ​| (Audited)  \nASSETS| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​  \nCurrent Assets| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nCash| ​| ​| $38,858| ​| ​| $25,000  \nTotal current assets| ​| ​| 38,858| ​| ​| 25,000  \nDeferred offering costs| ​| ​| 233,463| ​| ​| 208,241  \nTotal assets| ​| ​| $272,321| ​| ​| $233,241  \n​| ​| ​| ​  \nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDER’S EQUITY| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​  \nCurrent Liabilities| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nAccrued expenses| ​| ​| $223,463| ​| ​| $214,935  \nPromissory note payable - related party| ​| ​| 35,000| ​| ​| —  \nTotal current liabilities| ​| ​| 258,463| ​| ​| 214,935  \n​| ​| ​| ​  \nCommitments| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​  \nShareholder’s Equity| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nPreferred shares, $0.0001 par value;

DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS\n\nBlue Ocean Acquisition Corp (the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on March 26, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”). The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.\n\nAs of June 30, 2021, the Company had not yet commenced any operations. All activity for the period March 26, 2021 (inception), through June 30, 2021, relates to the Company’s formation and the proposed initial public offering (the “Proposed Offering”) which is described below. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Public Offering. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end.\n\nThe Company’s ability to commence operations is contingent upon obtaining adequate financial resources through a proposed initial public offering of 15,000,000 units at $10.00 per unit (or 17,250,000 units if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) (the “Units” and, with respect to the shares of Class A ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the “Public Shares”) which is discussed in Note 3 and the sale of 7,750,000 warrants (or 8,650,000 warrants if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant that will close in a private placement to Blue Ocean Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”) and Apollo SPAC Fund I, L.P. (“Apollo”) simultaneously with the closing of the Proposed Offering (see Note 4).\n\nThe Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Proposed Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. NASDAQ rules provide that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (as defined below) (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing a definitive agreement to enter a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. Upon the closing of the Proposed Offering, management has agreed that $10.20 per Unit sold in the Proposed Offering, including the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, will be held in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) and may or may not be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company’s shareholders, as described below.\n\nThe Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the “public shareholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business.\n\nCombination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. In connection with a proposed Business Combination, the Company may seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against a Business Combination. The Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks shareholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Company’s Memorandum and Articles of \n\nF-7\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nBLUE OCEAN ACQUISITION CORP \n\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nNOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS(cont.)\n\nAssociation provides that, a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to 15% or more of the Public Shares without the Company’s prior written consent.\n\nThe public shareholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially $10.20 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The per-share amount to be distributed to shareholders who redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriter (as discussed in Note 7). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company’s warrants. These shares of Class A ordinary shares will be recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Proposed Offering, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.”\n\nIf a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Memorandum and Articles of Association, offer such redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination.\n\nThe Company’s Sponsor and Apollo have agreed (a) to vote their Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Proposed Offering in favor of a Business Combination, (b) not to propose an amendment to the Company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association with respect to the Company’s pre-Business Combination activities prior to the consummation of a Business Combination unless the Company provides dissenting public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment; (c) not to redeem any shares (including the Founder Shares) into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a Business Combination (or to sell any shares in a tender offer in connection with a Business Combination if the Company does not seek shareholder approval in connection therewith) or a vote to amend the provisions of the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association relating to shareholders’ rights of pre-Business Combination activity and (d) that the Founder Shares shall not participate in any liquidating distributions upon winding up if a Business Combination is not consummated. However, the Sponsor and Apollo will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares purchased during or after the Proposed Offering if the Company fails to complete its Business Combination.\n\nIf the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) from the closing of the Proposed Offering (the “Combination Period”), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Company’s board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company, subject in each case to its obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law. The underwriter has agreed to waive its rights to the deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Proposed Offering price per Unit ($10.00).\n\nF-8\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nBLUE OCEAN ACQUISITION CORP \n\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nNOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS(cont.)\n\nThe Sponsor and Apollo have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to the Founder Shares and Private Placement Shares it will receive if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor, Apollo or any of their respective affiliates acquire Public Shares, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, and in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).\n\nIn order to protect the amounts held in the trust, the Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.20 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the day of liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.20 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriter of Proposed Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and believe that the Sponsor’s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot assure its shareholders that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of the Company’s officers or directors will indemnify the Company for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.\n\nGoing Concern Consideration\n\nOn June 30, 2021, the Company had $38,858 in cash and working capital deficit of $219,605. The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Management plans to address this uncertainty through the Proposed Offering as discussed in Note 3. There is no assurance that the Company’s plans to raise capital or to consummate a Business Combination will be successful or successful within the Combination Period. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\nRisks and Uncertainties\n\nManagement is currently evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company’s financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\nF-9\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nBLUE OCEAN ACQUISITION CORP \n\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying financial statements are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. The amounts presented after April 9, 2021 are not audited.\n\nEmerging Growth Company\n\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\n\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company, which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\n\nMaking estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company had $38,858 in cash held in its operating account as of June 30, 2021. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of June 30, 2021.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\n\nF-10\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nBLUE OCEAN ACQUISITION CORP \n\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES(cont.)\n\nASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of June 30, 2021. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position.\n\nThere is currently no taxation imposed on income by the Government of the Cayman Islands. In accordance with Cayman income tax regulations, income taxes are not levied on the Company. Consequently, income taxes are not reflected in the Company’s financial statements. The Company’s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.\n\nNet Loss Per Ordinary Share\n\nNet loss per share of ordinary shares is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, excluding ordinary shares subject to forfeiture. Weighted average shares were reduced for the effect of an aggregate of 562,500 shares of Class B ordinary shares that are subject to forfeiture if the over-allotment option is not exercised by the underwriter (see Note 5). On June 30, 2021, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into ordinary shares and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share for the period presented.\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” approximates the carrying amounts represented in the balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature.\n\nFair Value Measurements\n\nThe Company follows the guidance in ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement”, (“ASC 820”) for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually.\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities). \n\nThe following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities:\n\nLevel 1:| Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.   \n---|---  \nLevel 2:| Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.   \n---|---  \nLevel 3:| Unobservable inputs based on our assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  \n---|---  \n  \nF-11\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nBLUE OCEAN ACQUISITION CORP \n\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES(cont.)\n\nIn some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging”. Derivative instruments are initially recorded at fair value on the grant date and re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statement of operations. Derivative assets and liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred Offering Costs Associated with the Public Offering\n\nDeferred offering costs consist of legal and accounting expenses incurred through the balance sheet date that are directly related to the Public Offering. Deferred offering costs will be allocated to the separable financial instruments issued in the Public Offering based on a relative fair value basis, compared to total proceeds received. Upon completion of the Public Offering, offering costs associated with warrant liabilities will be expensed, and presented as non-operating expenses in the statement of operations and offering costs associated with the Class A ordinary shares will be charged to shareholders’ equity. Should the Public Offering prove to be unsuccessful, these deferred costs, as well as additional expenses to be incurred, will be charged to operations.\n\nClass A Shares Subject to Possible Redemption\n\nThe Company accounts for its Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption are classified as a liability instrument and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders’ equity. The Company’s Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are classified as temporary equity. At June 30, 2021 and April 9, 2021, there were no Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption outstanding. \n\nStock Compensation Expense\n\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”). Under ASC 718, stock-based compensation associated with equity-classified awards is measured at fair value upon the grant date and recognized over the requisite service period. To the extent a stock-based award is subject to a performance condition, the amount of expense recorded in a given period, if any, reflects an assessment of the probability of achieving such performance condition, with compensation recognized once the event is deemed probable to occur. Forfeitures are recognized as incurred. The Company has recognized no stock-based compensation expense during the period from inception to June 30, 2021.\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\n\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (“ASU 2020-06”) to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity's own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures \n\nF-12\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nBLUE OCEAN ACQUISITION CORP \n\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES(cont.)\n\nfor convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity's own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. As a smaller reporting company, ASU 2020-06 is effective January 1, 2024 and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that ASU 2020-06 would have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.\n\nNOTE 3. PROPOSED OFFERING\n\nPursuant to the Proposed Offering, the Company will offer for sale up to 15,000,000 Units (or 17,250,000 Units if the underwriter’s overallotment option is exercised in full) at a purchase price of $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit will consist of one Class A ordinary share, $0.0001 par value, and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“Public Warrant”). Each whole Public Warrant will entitle the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share (see Note 7).\n\nNOTE 4. PRIVATE PLACEMENT\n\nThe Sponsor and Apollo SPAC Fund I, L.P., a fund managed by the affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc., have agreed to purchase an aggregate of 7,750,000 Private Placement Warrants (or 8,650,000 Private Placement Warrants if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) at a price of $1.00 per warrant, in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of Proposed Offering.\n\nEach Private Placement Warrant is identical to the warrants offered in the Proposed Offering, except there will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to Private Placement Warrants, which will expire worthless if we do not consummate a Business Combination within the Combination Period.\n\nNOTE 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\n\nFounder Shares\n\nOn March 26, 2021, the Company issued an aggregate of 4,312,500 shares of Class B ordinary shares (the “Founder Shares”) to the Sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. The Founder Shares include an aggregate of up to 562,500 shares subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor to the extent that the underwriter’s over-allotment is not exercised in full or in part, so that the Sponsor will collectively own, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares after the Proposed Offering (assuming the Sponsor does not purchase any Public Shares in the Proposed Offering).\n\nApollo has expressed to the Company an interest to purchase up to 9.99% of the total Units (excluding any Units sold in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option (see Note 6)) sold in the Proposed Offering at the offering price of $10.00 per Unit. Apollo entered into a subscription agreement with the Company and the Sponsor pursuant to which Apollo agreed to purchase an indirect interest in the Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants from the Sponsor at the closing of the Proposed Offering. Subject to Apollo purchasing 9.99% of the Proposed Offering and the potential forfeiture described below, at the closing of this offering, the Company will sell 175,000 Founder Shares to Apollo at $0.0058 per Founder Share. Additionally, at the closing of our initial business combination, the Company will sell 125,000 Founder Shares to Apollo at $0.0058 per Founder Share less such number of shares subject to a reduction in ownership.\n\nHowever, if Apollo does not enter into a binding commitment to purchase an amount of Class A ordinary shares with a value of at least $25,000,000 (or equivalent securities of the target of the business combination or the successor registrant of the Company) in a private placement financing that will close concurrently with the closing of the initial business combination, the number of founder shares that Apollo will be entitled to purchase will be reduced up to 125,000 Founder Shares on a pro rata basis. Additionally, if immediately following the closing of the initial business combination, (i) Apollo owns less than 100% but more than 50% of the 9.99% of the Class A ordinary shares sold \n\nF-13\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nBLUE OCEAN ACQUISITION CORP \n\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nNOTE 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS(cont.)\n\nto Apollo (including any shares sold by the underwriter in connection with the exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option), then Apollo will forfeit its right to purchase up to 50,000 Founder Shares on a pro rata basis, or (ii) Apollo owns less than 50% of the 9.99% of the Class A ordinary shares sold by the Company in this offering (including any shares sold by the underwriter in connection with the exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option), then Apollo will forfeit its right to purchase up to 75,000 Founder Shares in addition to the forfeiture of 50,000 Founder Shares pursuant to (i) on a pro rata basis.\n\nThere can be no assurance that the anchor investors will acquire any Units in the Proposed Offering, or as to the amount of such Units the anchor investors will retain, if any, prior to or upon the consummation of an initial Business Combination. There is also no guarantee that Apollo will participate in the Proposed Offering. In addition, the Units Apollo may purchase in this offering will not be subject to any agreements restricting their transfer.\n\nThe Sponsor and Apollo have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of its Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) one year after the completion of a Business Combination or (B) subsequent to our initial business combination (x) if the last reported sale price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, share dividends, rights issuances, consolidations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and other similar transactions) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination or (y) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of our public shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property.\n\nThe excess of the fair value of the Founder Shares that will be sold to Apollo were determined to be offering costs in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A and 5T. Accordingly, the offering cost will be allocated to the separable financial instruments issued in the Proposed Offering based on a relative fair value basis, compared to total proceeds received. Offering costs allocated to derivative warrant liabilities will be expensed as incurred in the statement of operations. Offering costs allocated to the Public Shares will be charged to equity upon the completion of the Proposed Offering.\n\nApollo has not been granted any shareholder or other rights in addition to those afforded to the Company’s other public shareholders. Further, Apollo is not required to (i) hold any Units, Class A ordinary shares or warrants they may purchase in the Proposed Offering or thereafter for any amount of time, (ii) vote any Class A ordinary shares they may own at the applicable time in favor of the Business Combination or (iii) refrain from exercising their right to redeem their public shares at the time of the Business Combination. Apollo will have the same rights to the funds held in the Trust Account with respect to the Class A ordinary shares underlying the Units they may purchase in the Proposed Offering as the rights afforded to the Company’s other public shareholders.\n\nPromissory Note—Related Party\n\nOn April 5, 2021, the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company an aggregate of up to $300,000 to cover expenses related to the Proposed Offering pursuant to a promissory note (the “Note”). The Note is non-interest bearing and is payable on the earlier of (i) April 30, 2022 or (ii) the consummation of the Public Offering. As of June 30, 2021, the Company has drawn $35,000 on the promissory note.\n\nRelated Party Loans\n\nIn order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Company’s Sponsor, an affiliate of the Sponsor, or the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (the “Working Capital Loans”). Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of notes may be converted upon consummation of a Business Combination into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. There are no Working Capital Loans outstanding as of June 30, 2021.\n\nF-14\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nBLUE OCEAN ACQUISITION CORP \n\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nNOTE 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS(cont.)\n\nAdministrative Support Agreement\n\nCommencing on the date of the prospectus and until completion of the Company’s initial business combination or liquidation, the Company may reimburse an affiliate of the Sponsor up to an amount of $10,000 per month for office space and secretarial and administrative support.\n\nNOTE 6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\nRegistration Rights\n\nThe holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and any warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans (and in each case holders of their component securities, as applicable) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of the Proposed Offering, requiring the Company to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to our Class A ordinary shares). The holders of the majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the consummation of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\n\nUnderwriter’s Agreement\n\nThe Company will grant the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to 2,250,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments at the Proposed Offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions.\n\nThe underwriter will be entitled to a cash underwriting discount of 2.00% of the gross proceeds of the Proposed Offering, or $3,000,000 (or $3,450,000 if the over-allotment option in exercised in full). In addition, the underwriter will be entitled to a deferred fee of three and a half percent (3.50%) of the gross proceeds of the Proposed Offering, or $5,250,000 (or $6,037,500 if the over-allotment option in exercised in full). The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. The underwriter has agreed to reimburse the Company for up to $500,000 for offering expenses. The reimbursement of these costs will be accounted for as a reduction to deferred offering costs upon completion of the Proposed Offering.\n\nNOTE 7. WARRANT LIABILITIES\n\nThe Company will account for the 15,250,000 warrants to be issued in connection with the Public Offering (the 7,500,000 Public Warrants and the 7,750,000 Private Placement Warrants assuming the underwriter’s over-allotment option is not exercised) in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40. Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each warrant much be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, the Company will classify each warrant as a liability at its fair value. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the Company’s statement of operations.\n\nWarrants—Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants will become exercisable 30 days after the consummation of a Business Combination. The Public Warrants will expire five years from the consummation of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.\n\nThe Company will not be obligated to deliver any Class A ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a Public Warrant and will have no obligation to settle such Public Warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration. No Public Warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and the Company will \n\nF-15\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nBLUE OCEAN ACQUISITION CORP \n\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nNOTE 7. WARRANT LIABILITIES(cont.)\n\nnot be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their Public Warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available.\n\nThe Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days, after the closing of a Business Combination, it will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement registering the issuance, under the Securities Act, of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the shares of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants, to cause such registration statement to become effective and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the shares of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th business day after the closing of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption.\n\nRedemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $18.00. Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the Warrants for redemption:\n\n•| in whole and not in part;  \n---|---  \n•| at a price of $0.01 per Public Warrant;  \n---|---  \n•| upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder and  \n---|---  \n•| if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company will not redeem the warrants as described above unless an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares is available throughout the 30-day redemption period. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, the Company may exercise its redemption right even if the Company is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.\n\nRedemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00. Once the Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the Warrants for redemption:\n\n•| in whole and not in part;  \n---|---  \n•| at $0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption provided that holders will be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares determined by reference to the table based on the redemption date and the “fair market value” of our Class A ordinary shares;  \n---|---  \n•| if, and only if, the Reference Value (as defined above under “Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $18.00”) equals or exceeds $10.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant); and  \n---|---  \n•| if the Reference Value is less than $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant), the private placement warrants must also concurrently be called for redemption on the same terms as the outstanding public warrants, as described above.  \n---|---  \n  \nF-16\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nBLUE OCEAN ACQUISITION CORP \n\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nNOTE 7. WARRANT LIABILITIES(cont.)\n\nIf and when the Public Warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may not exercise its redemption right if the issuance of shares of ordinary shares upon exercise of the warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or the Company is unable to effect such registration or qualification.\n\nThe exercise price and number of shares of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Public Warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless. If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless.\n\nIn addition, if (x) the Company issues additional shares of Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of its initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of Class A ordinary shares (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company’s board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the Sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the “Newly Issued Price”), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the Company’s initial Business Combination on the date of the consummation of such initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price and the $18.00 per share redemption trigger price described above will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the greater of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.\n\nThe Private Placement Warrants will be identical to the Public Warrants included in the Units being sold in the Proposed Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants will and the shares of ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis and will be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.\n\nThe accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record a derivative liability upon the closing of the Public Offering. Under ASC Section 815-40-15, a warrant is not indexed to the issuer’s common stock if the terms of the warrant require an adjustment to the exercise price upon a specified event and that event is not an input to the fair value of the warrant. Based on management’s evaluation, the Company concluded that the Company’s Private Placement Warrants are not indexed to the Company’s common stock in the manner contemplated by ASC Section 815-40-15 because the holder of the instrument is not an input into the pricing of a fixed-for-fixed option on equity shares. In addition, the Company concluded that the tender offer provision fails the “classified in shareholder’s equity” criteria as contemplated by ASC Section 815-40-25.\n\nF-17\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nBLUE OCEAN ACQUISITION CORP \n\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nNOTE 7. WARRANT LIABILITIES(cont.)\n\nAccordingly, the Company will classify each warrant as a liability at its fair value and the warrants will be allocated a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Units equal to its fair value determined by the Monte Carlo simulation or the Black-Scholes model. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the Company’s statement of operations. The Company will reassess the classification at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the warrants will be reclassified as of the date of the event that causes the reclassification.\n\nNOTE 8. SHAREHOLDER’S EQUITY\n\nPreferred Shares—The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value preferred shares. On April 9, 2021 and June 30, 2021, there were no preferred shares issued or outstanding.\n\nClass A Ordinary shares—The Company is authorized to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of Class A, $0.0001 par value ordinary shares. Holders of the Company’s ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share. On April 9, 2021 and June 30, 2021, there were no shares of Class A ordinary shares issued or outstanding.\n\nClass B Ordinary shares—The Company is authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of Class B, $0.0001 par value ordinary shares. Holders of the Company’s ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share. On April 9, 2021 and June 30, 2021, there were 4,312,500 Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding, of which an aggregate of up to 562,500 shares are subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriter’s over-allotment option is not exercised in full or in part so that the Sponsor will own 20% of the Company’s issued and outstanding ordinary shares after the Proposed Offering (assuming the Sponsor does not purchase any Public Shares in the Proposed Offering).\n\nHolders of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all other matters submitted to a vote of shareholders, except as required by law; provided that only holders of Class B ordinary shares have the right to vote for the election of directors prior to the Company’s initial Business Combination.\n\nThe shares of Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for share sub-divisions, share dividends, rights issuances, consolidations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like, and subject to further adjustment as provided herein. In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts issued in this offering and related to the closing of our initial business combination, the ratio at which the Class B ordinary shares will convert into Class A ordinary shares will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding Class B ordinary shares agree to waive such anti-dilution adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Class B ordinary shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of all ordinary shares issued and outstanding upon the completion of this offering plus all Class A ordinary shares and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with our initial business combination, excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in our initial business combination. The term “equity-linked securities” refers to any debt or equity securities that are convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for our Class A ordinary shares issued in a financing transaction in connection with our initial business combination, including but not limited to a private placement of equity or debt.\n\nNOTE 9. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\nManagement of the Company evaluated events that have occurred after the balance sheet date through November 8, 2021, the date these financial statements were available to be issued. Based upon this review, other than as described below, management did not identify any recognized or non-recognized subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements. \n\nF-18\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\n15,000,000 Units\n\n![](logo_blueoceanx1.jpg)\n\nPreliminary Prospectus\n\n, 2021\n\nSole Book-Running Manager\n\nNeedham & Company\n\nUntil , 2021 (25 days after the date of this prospectus), all dealers that buy, sell or trade our ordinary shares, whether or not participating in this offering, may be required to deliver a prospectus. This is in addition to the dealers’ obligation to deliver a prospectus when acting as underwriter and with respect to its unsold allotments or subscriptions.\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nPART II\n\nINFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS\n\nItem 13.| Other Expenses of Issuance and Distribution.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe estimated expenses payable by us in connection with the offering described in this registration statement (other than the underwriting discount and commissions) will be as follows:\n\nSEC expenses| ​| ​| $15,991  \n---|---|---|---  \nFINRA expenses| ​| ​| 26,375  \nAccounting fees and expenses| ​| ​| 75,000  \nPrinting and engraving expenses| ​| ​| 35,000  \nNasdaq listing and filing fees| ​| ​| 75,000  \nLegal fees and expenses| ​| ​| 350,000  \nMiscellaneous| ​| ​| 50,000  \nTotal| ​| ​| $627,366  \nItem 14.| Indemnification of Directors and Officers.  \n---|---  \n  \nCayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against willful default, willful neglect, civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide for indemnification of our officers and directors to the maximum extent permitted by law, including for any liability incurred in their capacities as such, except through their own actual fraud, willful default or willful neglect. We will enter into agreements with our directors and officers to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. We expect to purchase a policy of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors.\n\nOur officers and directors have agreed to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the trust account, and have agreed to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any services provided to us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason whatsoever (except to the extent they are entitled to funds from the trust account due to their ownership of public shares). Accordingly, any indemnification provided will only be able to be satisfied by us if (i) we have sufficient funds outside of the trust account or (ii) we consummate an initial business combination.\n\nWe believe that these provisions, the insurance and the indemnity agreements are necessary to attract and retain talented and experienced officers and directors.\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.\n\nWe will enter into indemnity agreements with each of our officers and directors, a form of which is to be filed as an exhibit to this Registration Statement. These agreements will require us to indemnify these individuals to the fullest extent permitted under laws of the Cayman Islands and to advance expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified.\n\nPursuant to the Underwriting Agreement filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this Registration Statement, we have agreed to indemnify the underwriter and the underwriter has agreed to indemnify us against certain civil liabilities that may be incurred in connection with this offering, including certain liabilities under the Securities Act.\n\nItem 15.| Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities.  \n---|---  \n  \nOn April 7, 2021, we issued an aggregate of 4,312,500 founder shares, or approximately $0.006 per share, to Blue Ocean Sponsor LLC, our sponsor (up to 562,500 of which will be surrendered to us by our sponsor for no consideration after the closing of this offering depending on the extent to which the underwriter’s over-allotment \n\nII-1\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\noption is exercised). Such securities were issued in connection with our organization pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The total number of Class B ordinary shares outstanding after this offering and the expiration of the underwriter’s over-allotment option will equal 20% of the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares outstanding at such time. The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder thereof, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment, as described in this prospectus. If we increase or decrease the size of this offering, we will effect a share capitalization or a share repurchase or redemption or other appropriate mechanism, as applicable, with respect to our Class B ordinary shares immediately prior to the consummation of this offering in such amount as to maintain the number of founder shares, on an as-converted basis, at 20% of the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares outstanding at such time (assuming the underwriter exercises its over-allotment option in full).\n\nOur sponsor and Apollo have committed, pursuant to separate written agreements, to purchase an aggregate of 7,750,000 private placement warrants (or 8,650,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full), each exercisable to purchase one ordinary share at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, at a price of $1.00 per warrant ($7,750,000 in the aggregate or $8,650,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full), in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of this offering. Our sponsor will purchase 7,650,000 private placement warrants (or 8,550,000 warrants if the Underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) and Apollo will purchase 100,000 warrants. These issuances will be made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.\n\nIn the event that our sponsor deems it necessary in order to facilitate our initial business combination for the sponsor to forfeit, transfer, exchange or amend the terms of all or any portion of the private placement warrants or to enter into any other arrangements with respect to the private placement warrants (including, without limitation, a transfer of the sponsor’s membership interests representing an interest in the private placement warrants) to facilitate the consummation of such business combination, such change shall apply pro rata to Apollo and our sponsor based on the relative number of private placement warrants held by each. By way of example, in the event 50% of the sponsor’s private placement warrants are forfeited or transferred by the sponsor as part of such business combination, Apollo shall forfeit or transfer 50% of its private placement warrants on substantially the same terms and conditions as the sponsor, in which case the reduction shall equal 50% of the private placement warrants held by Apollo at such time.\n\nNo underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sales.\n\nItem 16.| Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.  \n---|---  \n  \n(a) Exhibits.

In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.\n\n(c) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that:\n\n(1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.\n\n(2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\n\nII-3\n\n[TABLE OF CONTENTS](#TOC)\n\nSIGNATURES\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this Registration Statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of New York, State of New York, on the 8th day of November, 2021.\n\n​| ​| Blue Ocean Acquisition Corp| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| By:| ​| ​| /s/ Paul Bascobert| ​| ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​| Paul BascobertChief Executive Officer  \n  \nPOWER OF ATTORNEY\n\nKNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS, that each person whose signature appears below constitutes and appoints Paul Bascobert and Ankur Manglik his true and lawful attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution and resubstitution for him and in his name, place and stead, in any and all capacities to sign any and all amendments including pre- and post-effective amendments to this registration statement, any subsequent registration statement for the same offering which may be filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and pre- or post-effective amendments thereto, and to file the same, with all exhibits thereto, and other documents in connection therewith, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, hereby ratifying and confirming all that said attorney-in-fact or his substitute, each acting alone, may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue thereof.\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, this Registration Statement has been signed below by the following persons in the capacities and on the dates indicated.\n\nName| ​| ​| Position| ​| ​| Date  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| ​| ​  \n/s/ Marcus Brauchli| ​| ​| Chairman| ​| ​| November 8, 2021  \nMarcus Brauchli| ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​  \n/s/ Paul Bascobert| ​| ​| Chief Executive Officer(Principal Executive Officer) | ​| ​| November 8, 2021  \nPaul Bascobert | ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​  \n/s/ Ankur Manglik| ​| ​| Chief Financial Officer(Principal Financial and Accounting Officer) | ​| ​| November 8, 2021   \nAnkur Manglik| ​\n"

Our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our or our management team’s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or\nstrategies regarding the future.

References to “founder\nshares” are to our Class B ordinary shares initially purchased by our sponsor in a private placement prior to our initial public offering, and the Class A ordinary shares\nissued upon the conversion thereof as provided herein, and references to “initial shareholders” are to holders of our founder shares prior to our initial public offering.\nItem 1. Business.\nGeneral\nBlue Ocean Acquisition Corp is a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share\nexchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this\nreport as our initial business combination. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, we are a\n“shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of\ncash.\nOn December 7, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 16,500,000 units (the “Units”), each Unit consisting of one Class A ordinary\nshare of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A ordinary shares”) and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (each, a “Warrant”), each\nwhole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share for $11.50 per share (subject to adjustment). The Units were sold at a price of $10.00\nper Unit, and the IPO generated gross proceeds of $165,000,000. Substantially concurrent with the closing of the IPO, we consummated a private placement (the\n“Private Placement”) with our sponsor and Apollo SPAC Fund I, L.P., a fund managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc (“Apollo”), of an aggregate of\n8,235,000 warrants (the “private placement warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $8,235,000. On\nDecember 7, 2021, a total of $168,300,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of\nthe Company’s public shareholders at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the “Trust Account”), with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.\nOn December 7, 2021, the Underwriter exercised in full the option granted to them by the Company to purchase up to 2,475,000 additional Units (the “Over-\nAllotment Option Units”) solely to cover over-allotments, which option was granted to them under the underwriting agreement for the IPO. The sale of these 2,475,000\nOver-Allotment Option Units closed on December 9, 2021, generating gross proceeds of $24,750,000. Substantially concurrent with the closing of the over-allotment\noption, we consummated a private placement (the “Additional Private Placement” and, together with the Private Placement, the “Private Placements”) with our\nsponsor of an additional 990,000 private placement warrants at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $990,000.\nOn December 9, 2021, a total of $25,245,000 of the proceeds from the closing of the Over-Allotment Option Units and the Additional Private Placement were deposited\ninto the Trust Account, resulting in a total deposit of $193,545,000 in the Trust Account since the Trust Account was established. The net proceeds deposited into the\nTrust Account remain on deposit in the Trust Account earning interest and are available for a business combination, assuming no redemptions, after payment of up to\n$6,641,250 of deferred underwriting fees, before fees and expenses associated with our initial business combination.\nOn January 21, 2022 we announced that, commencing January 24, 2022, holders of the 18,975,000 Units sold in our initial public offering may elect to\nseparately trade Class A ordinary shares and the Warrants included in the Units. Those Units not separated continued to trade on the Nasdaq Global Market under\nthe symbol “BOCNU” and Class A ordinary shares and warrants that were separated trade under the symbols “BOCN” and “BOCNW,” respectively.\n2\nTable of Contents\nExcept with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to us to pay our tax obligations (less up to $100,000\ninterest to pay dissolution expenses), the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest of (i) the completion\nof our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by June 7, 2023 (or by September 7,\n2023 if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended), subject to applicable law, or (iii) the redemption of our public shares properly submitted\nin connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (i) to modify the substance or timing of our\nobligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our\ninitial business combination by June 7, 2023 (or by September 7, 2023 if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended), or (ii) with respect to\nany other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity. The proceeds held in the Trust Account may only be invested only in\nU.S. government securities with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as amended, (the “Investment Company Act) which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur business strategy is to identify and complete a business combination that can create value for shareholders over time. We believe our experience and\ndeep network of relationships will help us identify a significant number of appealing business combination opportunities and enable us to evaluate these\nopportunities. Our management team has significant experience in multiple business models, across geographies and markets. Moreover, we believe that our\nmanagement team’s backgrounds will make us attractive, long-term partners to business combination targets and help the post-business combination company to\nthrive in the public markets.\nOur approach to sourcing and evaluating investment opportunities will draw on our management team’s experience and what we consider to be best practices\nfor value creation. We plan to leverage our management team’s extensive experience and expertise in a methodical process to identify best-in-class initial business\ncombination targets.\nAcquisition Criteria\nWe intend to pursue opportunities with exceptional growth companies addressing large market opportunities in highly differentiated ways. We are not limited\nby geography-either by focusing only on the U.S. or developed markets or by exploring only large emerging markets. We draw on our management team’s decades of\nglobal experience in sourcing transactions, understanding and conducting due diligence on new breakthrough technologies and leadership teams in order to identify\nand then negotiate a corporate combination. Our management team has experience in a number of areas related to business information and data, new products, digital\nvideo and audio platforms, including podcasting, sports and gaming media, and events platforms. We intend to find a target company that defines, is capable of\nsignificant and sustained growth, and relies on a disruptive and highly defensible strategy.\nValuation: We intend to target companies whose enterprise value is between $750 million and $2.0 billion. Companies of this size offer the potential for significant\nlong-term shareholder return.\nHigh growth sectors: We intend to seek companies within the consumer Internet sector and adjacent industry segments, including, but not limited to, online\nmarketplaces, education technology, advertising technology and direct-to-consumer e-Commerce businesses.\nDifferentiation and scale: We intend to seek to invest in a business with a clearly differentiated market strategy and a clear vision for how it will scale the business\nand deploy a capital infusion effectively to accelerate growth, maintain or improve margins and outlast competition.\nGeography: We intend to seek opportunities globally, with a particular emphasis on large-population, high-growth emerging regions in Asia and the Americas,\nincluding the United States.\n3\nTable of Contents\nLarge market opportunities: We intend to seek opportunities that have traction and the potential to scale significantly into leaders in their markets. The addressable\nsize of the market has to justify not only the valuation at the time of our initial business combination but also leave considerable runway for future upside. We intend\nto prioritize companies that take a “winner takes most” or “first mover advantage” approach.\nGrowth: We intend to seek companies that are on a sustainable growth trajectory, benefiting from the tailwinds of global Internet adoption.\nManagement excellence: We intend to look for teams that are creative, ambitious, visionary and data-driven. A consistent record of growth, experience overcoming\nchallenges, and strategic vision are essential attributes.\nOperational maturity: We intend to seek companies which have the requisite compliance, financial controls and reporting processes in place and are ready for the\nregulatory requirements of a public entity.\nBest-in-class technology: Proprietary technology, or skillful deployment of technology and data, is essential to long-term success. So, too, is early-to-market\ndeployment: Speed is a competitive advantage in the use of technology and data.\nOpportunistic Strategy: The ability to effect business transformation and achieve growth requires an adaptable, market-tested, data-driven decision-making process\nand an experienced team. Where a target company’s leadership may lack this experience, our team, including our board members and advisors, can bring great depth in\nadaptive leadership.\nBenefit from being public: We intend to work with management and stakeholders who aspire to have their company become a public entity and generate substantial\ngrowth. The benefits of transitioning from a private to a public entity may include broader access to debt and equity providers, liquidity for employees and potential\nacquisitions, and expanded branding in the marketplace.\nThese criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be\nbased, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant.\nIn the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose\nthat the target business does not meet the above criteria and guidelines in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, would\nbe in the form of proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we would file with the SEC.\nWe will have until 18 months from the closing of our IPO, or June 7, 2023, to consummate an initial business combination, with an automatic three-month\nextension if we have signed a definitive agreement with respect to an initial business combination within such 18-month period. However, if we anticipate that we may\nnot be able to consummate our initial business combination within such 18-month period, we may extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by\nan additional three months (for a total of up to 21 months, or until September 7, 2023, to complete a business combination) without submitting such proposed\nextensions to our shareholders for approval or offering our public shareholders redemption rights in connection therewith. Pursuant to the terms of our memorandum\nand articles of association and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, in order to extend the time available for\nus to consummate our initial business combination, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon ten days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must\ndeposit into the trust account $1,897,500 ($0.10 per unit) on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for such three-month extension. Any such payments would\nbe made in the form of a loan. Any such loan will be non-interest bearing and payable upon the consummation of our initial business combination. If we complete our\ninitial business combination, we would repay such loaned amount out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. If we do not complete our initial business\ncombination, we will not repay such loan. Furthermore, the letter agreement with our initial shareholders and Apollo contains a provision pursuant to which our\nsponsor has agreed to waive its right to be repaid for such loan out of the funds held in the trust account in the event that we do not complete our initial business\ncombination. Our sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business\ncombination. Up to $1,500,000 of the loans made by our sponsor, our officers and directors, or their affiliates to us prior to or in connection with our initial business\ncombination (including any loan made to extend our time period for consummating our initial business combination) may be convertible into warrants, at a price of\n$1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. We will issue a press release announcing the extension at least three days prior to the applicable deadline.\n4\nTable of Contents\nAcquisition Process\nWe intend to conduct thorough due diligence to determine a prospective target’s quality and intrinsic value. That would include reviewing financial\nstatements, legal documents, patents and proprietary technology, and historical data. We intend to meet with members of management, consult with industry experts,\nclients and competitors, and seek information from analysts and others familiar with the prospective target company’s business and prospects.\nNasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the\nassets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our\nsigning a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our\ninitial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an\nopinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While\nwe consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make such independent determination of fair market value, it may be unable to do so if it is less\nfamiliar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target’s assets or prospects,\nincluding if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other\nspecialized skills and the board of directors determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. As any such opinion, if\nobtained, would only state that the fair market value meets the 80% threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of the target\nor the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required by Schedule 14A\nof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we will file with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in connection with our initial business combination will include such opinion.\nWe anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will\nown or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination\nsuch that the post- business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain\nobjectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination\ncompany owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient\nfor it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires\n50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-\nbusiness combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in\nwhich we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100%\ncontrolling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business\ncombination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity\ninterests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses\nthat is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of fair market value test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target\nbusiness, the 80% of fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the\ninitial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable.\nIn addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. To\nthe extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we\nmay be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target\nbusiness, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.\n5\nTable of Contents\nIf our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of\nthe consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemption of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash\nreleased to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of post-transaction businesses, the\npayment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working\ncapital.\nWe may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available\nfrom the proceeds held in our Trust Account or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business\ncombination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to\nissue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. We are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third\nparty with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise.\nRedemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination\nWe will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business\ncombination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, calculated as of two business days prior to the\nconsummation of our initial business combination, including interest (net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public\nshares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the Trust Account is initially anticipated to be $10.20 per public share. The per share amount we will\ndistribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriter. The redemption\nrights will include the requirement that any beneficial owner on whose behalf a redemption right is being exercised must identify itself in order to validly redeem its\nshares. Further, subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we will not proceed with redeeming our public shares,\neven if a public shareholder has properly elected to redeem its shares, if a business combination does not close. Our initial shareholders and Apollo have entered into\nagreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and, with the exception of Apollo and\ncertain advisors to the Company party thereto, any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. The other\nmembers of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our sponsor with respect to any public shares held by them.\nLimitations on Redemption\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause\nour net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon completion of our initial business combination (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny\nstock” rules). However, a greater net tangible asset or cash requirement may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example,\nthe proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners; (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital\nor other general corporate purposes; or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination.\nFurthermore, although we will not redeem shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to fall below $5,000,001 upon completion of our initial business\ncombination, we do not have a maximum redemption threshold based on the percentage of shares sold in our initial public offering. In the event the aggregate cash\nconsideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash\nconditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business\ncombination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an\nalternate business combination.\n6\nTable of Contents\nManner of Conducting Redemptions\nWe will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business\ncombination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. In the case of a general\nmeeting, such election must be made, unless extended by us in our sole discretion, no later than two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the\nproposal to approve the initial business combination. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a\ntender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the\ntransaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Under Nasdaq rules, asset acquisitions and\nshare purchases would not typically require shareholder approval, while direct mergers with our company and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our\noutstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would typically require shareholder approval. If we\nstructure a business combination transaction with a target company in a manner that requires shareholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a\nshareholder vote to approve the proposed business combination. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless\nshareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules\nof the SEC for business or other reasons.\nIf we hold a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will:\n• conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of\nproxies, and not pursuant to tender offer rules; and\n• file proxy materials with the SEC.\nIf we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:\n• conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e- 4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and\n• file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other\ninformation about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates\nthe solicitation of proxies.\nSubmission of Our Initial Business Combination to a Shareholder Vote\nIn the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide\nour public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.\nIf we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we receive an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which\nrequires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. In such case, our initial shareholders have\nagreed to vote their founder shares and, with the exception of Apollo and certain advisors to the Company, any public shares in favor of our initial business\ncombination. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all.\nIn addition, our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their\nfounder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their\nfounder shares and public shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of\nassociation (a) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business\ncombination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination by June 7, 2023 (or by September 7, 2023 if the period\nof time to consummate a business combination is extended) or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business\ncombination activity.\n7\nTable of Contents\nLimitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if We Seek Shareholder Approval\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination\npursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of\nsuch shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be\nrestricted from redeeming its shares with respect to Excess Shares (as defined below), without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage\nshareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a\nproposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on\nother undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the Class A ordinary shares that are part of the Units\nsold in the IPO could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the\nthen-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the Class A ordinary shares that are part\nof the Units sold in the IPO without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability\nto complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a\nminimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for\nor against our initial business combination.\nRedemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we will have only until June 7, 2023 (or until September 7, 2023 if the period\nof time to consummate a business combination is extended) to complete our initial business combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination within\nsuch time period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days\nthereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (less\nup to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which\nredemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as\npromptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve,\nsubject in each case, to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law.\nThere will be no redemption rights or liquidating distribution with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business\ncombination before June 7, 2023 (or September 7, 2023, if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended)\nCorporate Information\nOur executive offices are located at 2 Wisconsin Circle, 7th Floor, Chevy Chase, MD 20815, and our telephone number is (240) 235-5049.

As an existing public company, we offer a target business\nan alternative to a traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners\nof the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our Class A ordinary shares (or shares of a new holding company) or\nfor a combination of our Class A ordinary shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses will\nfind this method a more expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than a typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering\nprocess takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public\noffering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.\nFurthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering\nis always subject to the underwriter’s ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or\nhave negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing\nmanagement incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further\nbenefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the\nJumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements\nthat are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor\nattestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive\ncompensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation\nand shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a\nless active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in\nSection 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the\nadoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this\nextended transition period.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our\nIPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value\nof our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we\nhave issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” will have the\nmeaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.\nAdditionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain\nreduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company\nuntil the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s\nsecond fiscal quarter, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year or the market value of our ordinary shares held\nby non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure\nobligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.\n9\nTable of Contents\nCompetition\nWe expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be\nindividuals or investment partnerships), other special purpose acquisition companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of\nbusinesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or\nindirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other\nresources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors.\nWhile we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses\nthat are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain\ntarget businesses. Furthermore, we are obligated to offer holders of our public shares the right to redeem their shares for cash at the time of our initial business\ncombination in conjunction with a shareholder vote or via a tender offer. Target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our\ninitial business combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination.\nFacilities\nWe currently maintain our executive offices at 2 Wisconsin Circle, 7th Floor, Chevy Chase, MD 20815. The cost for our use of this space is included in the\n$10,000 per month fee we pay to an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, administrative and support services. We consider our current office space adequate for our\ncurrent operations.\nEmployees\nWe currently have four executive officers: Marcus Brauchli, our Chairman, Richard Leggett, our Chief Executive Officer, Matt Lasov, our Chief Financial\nOfficer, and Sean Glodek, our Vice President. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as\nmuch of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any such person will\ndevote in any time period to our company will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of\nthe business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors and all the other information contained in this report, including the financial statements. If any of\nthe following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our\nsecurities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risk factors described below are not necessarily exhaustive and you are encouraged\nto perform your own investigation with respect to us and our business.\nRisks Related to our Search for, Consummation of, or Inability to Consummate, a Business Combination and Post-Business Combination Risks\nWe are a recently incorporated blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company with no operating history and no revenues, and you\nhave no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.\nWe are a recently incorporated blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company with no operating results, and we did not\ncommence operations until after the closing of our IPO in December 2021. Because we lack an operating history, you have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability\nto achieve our business objective of completing our initial business combination. We do not yet have any plans, arrangements or understandings with any\nprospective target business concerning a business combination and may be unable to complete our initial business combination. If we fail to complete our initial\nbusiness combination, we will never generate any operating revenues.\n10\nTable of Contents\nOur public shareholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination, which means we may complete our initial\nbusiness combination even though a majority of our shareholders do not support such a combination.\nWe may choose not to hold a shareholder vote before we complete our initial business combination if the business combination would not require\nshareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. For instance, if we were seeking to acquire a target business where the consideration\nwe were paying in the transaction was all cash, we would typically not be required to seek shareholder approval to complete such a transaction. Except for as required\nby applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, the decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow\nshareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors, such as the timing of the\ntransaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. Accordingly, we may complete our initial business\ncombination even if holders of a majority of our outstanding ordinary shares do not approve of the business combination we complete.\nYour only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your\nshares from us for cash.\nBecause our board of directors may complete a business combination without seeking shareholder approval, public shareholders may not have the right or\nopportunity to vote on the business combination, unless we seek such shareholder vote. Accordingly, your only opportunity to affect the investment decision\nregarding our initial business combination may be limited to exercising your redemption rights within the period of time (which will be at least 20 business days) set\nforth in our tender offer documents mailed to our public shareholders in which we describe our initial business combination.\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our initial shareholders, Apollo (with respect to its founder shares) and members of our\nmanagement team have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public shareholders vote.\nOur initial shareholders, Apollo and management team also may from time to time purchase Class A ordinary shares prior to our initial business combination.\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, if we seek shareholder approval of an initial business combination, such initial\nbusiness combination will be approved only if we receive an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the\nshareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company, including the founder shares. If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business\ncombination, our initial shareholders, Apollo (with respect to its founder shares) and members of our management team have agreed to vote in favor of such initial\nbusiness combination, regardless of how our public shareholders vote. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ and Apollo’s founder shares, we would need\n6,940,626 or 36.58% (assuming all outstanding shares are voted) of the 18,975,000 public shares sold in our IPO to be voted in favor of a transaction, in order to have\nsuch initial business combination approved. Additionally, although none of our sponsor, officers or directors have expressed any current intention to purchase our\npublic shares, they are not restricted from doing so and there is no ceiling on the number of our public shares they may purchase. If they purchase any of our public\nshares and retain such shares until any shareholders vote on our initial business combination, the approval of our initial business combination by our shareholders\nwill be even more likely. In the event that Apollo purchases Units and votes its public shares in favor of our initial business combination, a smaller portion of\naffirmative votes from other public shareholders would be required to approve our initial business combination. However, Apollo is only required to vote its founder\nshares in favor of our initial business combination and is not obligated to vote its public shares in favor of our initial business combination. As there is no ceiling on\nthe number of Units that may be purchased by Apollo or on the number of our Units, shares or warrants that Apollo may purchase, the extent of Apollo’s influence on\nsuch shareholders vote may be even more significant. Accordingly, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, the agreement by our initial\nshareholders, Apollo and management team to vote in favor of our initial business combination will increase the likelihood that we will receive the requisite\nshareholder approval for such initial business combination.\n11\nTable of Contents\nThe ability of our public shareholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets,\nwhich may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target.\nWe may seek to enter into a business combination transaction agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a\nminimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition\nand, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the business combination. Furthermore, in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would\ncause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon completion of our initial business combination (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s\n“penny stock” rules). Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon\ncompletion of our initial business combination or such greater amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition as described above, we would not proceed with such\nredemption and the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate business combination. Prospective targets will be aware of these risks and,\nthus, may be reluctant to enter into a business combination transaction with us.\nThe ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable\nbusiness combination or optimize our capital structure.\nAt the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business combination, we will not know how many shareholders may exercise their redemption rights,\nand therefore will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If our initial business\ncombination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at\nclosing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to meet such requirements, or arrange for third party financing. In addition, if a larger\nnumber of shares are submitted for redemption than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the\nTrust Account or arrange for third party financing. Raising additional third-party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at\nhigher than desirable levels. In addition, the amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriter will not be adjusted for any shares that are\nredeemed in connection with an initial business combination. The per-share amount we will distribute to shareholders who properly exercise their redemption rights\nwill not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commission and after such redemptions, the amount held in trust will continue to reflect our obligation to pay the\nentire deferred underwriting commissions. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business combination available to us or\noptimize our capital structure.\nThe ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial\nbusiness combination would be unsuccessful and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your shares.\nIf our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a\nminimum amount of cash at closing, the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful is increased. If our initial business combination is\nunsuccessful, you would not receive your pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account until we liquidate the Trust Account. If you are in need of immediate\nliquidity, you could attempt to sell your shares in the open market; however, at such time our shares may trade at a discount to the pro rata amount per share in the\nTrust Account. In either situation, you may suffer a material loss on your investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with our redemption until we\nliquidate or you are able to sell your shares in the open market.\n12\nTable of Contents\nThe requirement that we complete our initial business combination before June 7, 2023 (or September 7, 2023 if the period of time to consummate a business\ncombination is extended) may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may limit the time we have in which to\nconduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, in particular as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to\ncomplete our initial business combination on terms that would produce value for our shareholders.\nAny potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning a business combination will be aware that we must complete our initial\nbusiness combination before June 7, 2023 (or September 7, 2023 if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended). Consequently, such target\nbusiness may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination, knowing that if we do not complete our initial business combination with that particular\ntarget business, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination with any target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the time frame\ndescribed above. In addition, we may have limited time to conduct due diligence and may enter into our initial business combination on terms that we would have\nrejected upon a more comprehensive investigation.\nOur search for a business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely\naffected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and other events, and the status of debt and equity markets.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has and is continuing to spread throughout China\nand other parts of the world, including the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease\n(COVID-19) a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern.” On January 31, 2020, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public\nhealth emergency for the United States to aid the U.S. healthcare community in responding to COVID-19, and on March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization\ncharacterized the outbreak as a “pandemic.” The COVID-19 pandemic and other events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of other\ninfectious diseases) could adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide, and the business of any potential target business with which we\nconsummate a business combination could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, we may be unable to complete a business combination if continued\nconcerns relating to COVID-19 continue to restrict travel, limit the ability to have meetings with potential investors or the target company’s personnel, vendors and\nservices providers are unavailable to negotiate and consummate a transaction in a timely manner. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for a business\ncombination will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the\nseverity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 or other events (such as terrorist\nattacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases) continue for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate a business\ncombination, or the operations of a target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, our ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by COVID-19\nand other events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases), including as a result of increased market volatility,\ndecreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nFinally, the COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, such as those\nrelated to the market for our securities and cross-border transactions.\nAs the number of special purpose acquisition companies evaluating targets increases, attractive targets may become scarcer and there may be more competition\nfor attractive targets. This could increase the cost of our initial business combination and could even result in our inability to find a target or to consummate an\ninitial business combination.\nIn recent years, the number of special purpose acquisition companies that have been formed has increased substantially. Many potential targets for special\npurpose acquisition companies have already entered into an initial business combination, and there are still many special purpose acquisition companies seeking\ntargets for their initial business combination, as well as many such companies currently in registration. As a result, at times, fewer attractive targets may be available,\nand it may require more time, more effort and more resources to identify a suitable target and to consummate an initial business combination.\n13\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, because there are more special purpose acquisition companies seeking to enter into an initial business combination with available targets, the\ncompetition for available targets with attractive fundamentals or business models may increase, which could cause targets companies to demand improved financial\nterms. Attractive deals could also become scarcer for other reasons, such as economic or industry sector downturns, geopolitical tensions, or increases in the cost of\nadditional capital needed to close business combinations or operate targets post-business combination. This could increase the cost of, delay or otherwise complicate\nor frustrate our ability to find and consummate an initial business combination, and may result in our inability to consummate an initial business combination on terms\nfavorable to our investors altogether.\nChanges in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial\nbusiness combination.\nIn recent months, the market for directors and officers liability insurance for special purpose acquisition companies has changed. Fewer insurance companies\nare offering quotes for directors and officers liability coverage, the premiums charged for such policies have generally increased and the terms of such policies have\ngenerally become less favorable. There can be no assurance that these trends will not continue.\nThe increased cost and decreased availability of directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate\nan initial business combination. In order to obtain directors and officers liability insurance or modify its coverage, the post-business combination entity might need to\nincur greater expense, accept less favorable terms or both. However, any failure to obtain adequate directors and officers liability insurance could have an adverse\nimpact on the post-business combination’s ability to attract and retain qualified officers and directors.\nIn addition, even after we were to complete an initial business combination, our directors and officers could still be subject to potential liability from claims\narising from conduct alleged to have occurred prior to the initial business combination. As a result, in order to protect our directors and officers, the post-business\ncombination entity may need to purchase additional insurance with respect to any such claims (“run-off insurance”). The need for run-off insurance would be an\nadded expense for the post-business combination entity, and could interfere with or frustrate our ability to consummate an initial business combination on terms\nfavorable to our investors.\nWe may not be able to complete our initial business combination before June 7, 2023 (or September 7, 2023 if the period of time to consummate a business\ncombination is extended, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and\nliquidate.\nWe may not be able to find a suitable target business and complete our initial business combination before June 7, 2023 (or September 7, 2023 if the period of\ntime to consummate a business combination is extended). Our ability to complete our initial business combination may be negatively impacted by general market\nconditions, volatility in the capital and debt markets and the other risks described herein. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the U.S. and global\neconomies and, while the extent of the impact of the outbreak on us will depend on future developments, it could limit our ability to complete our initial business\ncombination, including as a result of increased market volatility, decreased market liquidity and third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at\nall. Additionally, the outbreak of COVID-19 and other events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases) may\nnegatively impact businesses we may seek to acquire. If we have not completed our initial business combination within such time period, we will: (i) cease all\noperations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a\nper-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay\ndissolution expenses and net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely\nextinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably\npossible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case, to\nour obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. Our amended and\nrestated memorandum and articles of association provide that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we\nwill follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the Trust Account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days\nthereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law. In either such case, our public shareholders may receive only $10.20 per public share, or less than $10.20 per\npublic share, on the redemption of their shares, and our warrants will expire worthless. See “- If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust\nAccount could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.20 per public share” and other risk factors herein.\n14\nTable of Contents\nUnlike other blank check companies, we may extend the time to complete a business combination by up to three months without a shareholder vote or your\nability to redeem your shares.\nWe will have until June 7, 2023 to consummate an initial business combination, with an automatic three-month extension if we have signed a definitive\nagreement with respect to an initial business combination on or before June 7, 2023. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial\nbusiness combination before June 7, 2023, we may extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination by an additional three months (for a total\nof 21 months from the date of our IPO to complete a business combination) without submitting such proposed extensions to our shareholders for approval or offering\nour public shareholders redemption rights in connection therewith. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and\nsubject to deposit of additional funds by our sponsor or its affiliates or designees into our Trust Account as set forth thereunder, we may effectuate such extensions\nwithout submitting such proposed extensions to our shareholders for approval or offering our public shareholders redemption rights in connection with the proposed\nextensions.\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates\nmay elect to purchase public shares or public warrants, which may influence a vote on a proposed business combination and reduce the public float of our Class\nA ordinary shares or public warrants.\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination\npursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or public\nwarrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. Any such price per\nshare may be different than the amount per share a public shareholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial business\ncombination. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic\ninformation), our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to\nacquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, our sponsor, directors, officers,\nadvisors or any of their respective affiliates, are under no obligation to do so and they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such\ntransactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the Trust Account will be used to purchase public\nshares or public warrants in such transactions.\nIn the event that our sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated\ntransactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior\nelections to redeem their shares. The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby\nincrease the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination, (ii) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants\non any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination or (iii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement\nwith a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such\nrequirement would otherwise not be met. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise\nhave been possible. Any such purchase will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent the purchasers are subject to such\nreporting requirements.\n15\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants and the number of beneficial holders of our\nsecurities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.\nIf a shareholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our initial business combination, or fails to comply with the\nprocedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed.\nWe will comply with the proxy rules or tender offer rules, as applicable, when conducting redemptions in connection with our initial business combination.\nDespite our compliance with these rules, if a shareholder fails to receive our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, such shareholder may not\nbecome aware of the opportunity to redeem its shares. In addition, the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our\npublic shares in connection with our initial business combination will describe the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly redeem or tender\npublic shares. In the event that a shareholder fails to comply with these procedures, its shares may not be redeemed.\nYou will not have any rights or interests in funds from the Trust Account, except under certain limited circumstances. Therefore, to liquidate your investment, you\nmay be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.\nOur public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business\ncombination, and then only in connection with those Class A ordinary shares that such shareholders properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described\nherein, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles\nof association (a) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business\ncombination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination before June 7, 2023 (or September 7, 2023 if the\nperiod of time to consummate a business combination is extended) or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business\ncombination activity and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete an initial business combination before June 7, 2023 (or September 7, 2023 if the\nperiod of time to consummate a business combination is extended), subject to applicable law and as further described herein. In no other circumstances will a public\nshareholder have any right or interest of any kind in the Trust Account. Holders of warrants will not have any right to the proceeds held in the Trust Account with\nrespect to the warrants. Accordingly, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.\nNasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to\nadditional trading restrictions.\nOur Class A ordinary shares and warrants are listed on Nasdaq under the symbols “BOCN” and “BOCNW,” respectively. Although we currently meet the\ncurrent listing standards set forth in the Nasdaq listing standards, we cannot assure you that our securities will continue to be listed on Nasdaq prior to our initial\nbusiness combination. In order to continue listing our securities on Nasdaq prior to our initial business combination, we must maintain certain financial, distribution\nand share price levels. Generally, based on Nasdaq’s current listing standards, we must maintain a minimum market value of listed securities of $75,000,000 and a\nminimum of 400 holders of our listed securities. Additionally, our Units will not be traded after completion of our initial business combination, and, in connection with\nour initial business combination, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with Nasdaq’s initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than Nasdaq’s\ncontinued listing requirements, in order to continue to maintain the listing of our securities on Nasdaq. For instance, based on Nasdaq’s current listing standards, our\nshare price would be required to be at least $4.00 per share, the market value of listed securities would be required to be at least $75 million (or we would need to\nsatisfy certain shareholders’ equity or total assets and total revenue requirements) and we would be required to have a minimum of 400 round lot holders (with at least\n50% of such round lot holders holding securities with a market value of at least $2,500) of our securities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those\ninitial listing requirements at that time.\n16\nTable of Contents\nIf Nasdaq delists any of our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we\nexpect such securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n• a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n• reduced liquidity for our securities;\n• a determination that our Class A ordinary shares are a “penny stock” which will require brokers trading in our Class A ordinary shares to adhere to more\nstringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n• a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n• a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain\nsecurities, which are referred to as “covered securities.” Because our Class A ordinary shares and warrants are listed on Nasdaq, our Units, Class A ordinary shares\nand warrants currently qualify as covered securities under the statute. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of covered securities, the federal\nstatute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar\nthe sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by\nblank check companies, other than the State of Idaho, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or\nthreaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on Nasdaq, our securities\nwould not qualify as covered securities under the statute and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\nYou will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies.\nSince the net proceeds of our IPO and the Private Placements are intended to be used to complete an initial business combination with a target business that\nhas not been selected, we may be deemed to be a “blank check” company under the United States securities laws. However, because we have net tangible assets in\nexcess of $5,000,000 and have filed a Current Report on Form 8-K, including an audited balance sheet of the company demonstrating this fact, we are exempt from rules\npromulgated by the SEC to protect investors in blank check companies, such as Rule 419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of\nthose rules. Among other things, this means we will have a longer period of time to complete our initial business combination than do companies subject to Rule 419.\nMoreover, if our IPO had been subject to Rule 419, that rule would have prohibited the release of any interest earned on funds held in the Trust Account to us unless\nand until the funds in the Trust Account were released to us in connection with our completion of an initial business combination. For a more detailed comparison of\nour offering to offerings that comply with Rule 419.\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, and if you or a\n“group” of shareholders are deemed to hold in excess of 15% of our Class A ordinary shares, you will lose the ability to redeem all such shares in excess of 15%\nof our Class A ordinary shares.\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination\npursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of\nsuch shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be\nrestricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the Class A ordinary shares that are part of the Units sold in the IPO, which we\nrefer to as the “Excess Shares,” without our prior consent. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess\nShares) for or against our initial business combination. Your inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce your influence over our ability to complete our initial\nbusiness combination and you could suffer a material loss on your investment in us if you sell Excess Shares in open market transactions. Additionally, you will not\nreceive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if we complete our initial business combination. And as a result, you will continue to hold that\nnumber of shares exceeding 15% and, in order to dispose of such shares, would be required to sell your shares in open market transactions, potentially at a loss.\n17\nTable of Contents\nBecause of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial\nbusiness combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only\napproximately $10.20 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless.\nWe expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be\nindividuals or investment partnerships), other special purpose acquisition companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of\nbusinesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or\nindirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries.\nMany of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources\nwill be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially\nacquire with the net proceeds of the IPO and the Private Placements, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable\nwill be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target\nbusinesses. Furthermore, we are obligated to offer holders of our public shares the right to redeem their shares for cash at the time of our initial business combination\nin conjunction with a shareholder vote or via a tender offer. Target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business\ncombination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination.\nIf we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.20 per\npublic share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless.\nWe may not be able to complete an initial business combination with a U.S. target company if such initial business combination would be subject to U.S. foreign\ninvestment regulations and review by a U.S. government entity such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”), or may be\nultimately prohibited.\nCFIUS is an interagency committee authorized to review certain transactions involving foreign investment in the United States by foreign persons in order to\ndetermine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the United States. Were we considered to be a “foreign person” under such rules and regulations,\nany proposed business combination between us and a U.S. business engaged in a regulated industry or which may affect national security could be subject to such\nforeign ownership restrictions and/or CFIUS review. The scope of CFIUS was expanded by the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018\n(“FIRRMA”) to include certain non-controlling investments in sensitive U.S. businesses and certain acquisitions of real estate even with no underlying U.S. business.\nFIRRMA, and subsequent implementing regulations that are now in force, also subject certain categories of investments to mandatory filings. If our potential initial\nbusiness combination with a U.S. business falls within the scope of foreign ownership restrictions, we may be unable to consummate an initial business combination\nwith such business. In addition, if our potential business combination falls within CFIUS’s jurisdiction, we may be required to make a mandatory filing or determine to\nsubmit a voluntary notice to CFIUS, or to proceed with the initial business combination without notifying CFIUS and risk CFIUS intervention, before or after closing\nthe initial business combination. CFIUS may decide to block or delay our initial business combination, impose conditions to mitigate national security concerns with\nrespect to such initial business combination or order us to divest all or a portion of a U.S. business of the combined company if we had proceeded without first\nobtaining CFIUS clearance. The foreign ownership limitations, and the potential impact of CFIUS, may limit the attractiveness of a transaction with us or prevent us\nfrom pursuing certain initial business combination opportunities that we believe would otherwise be beneficial to us and our shareholders. As a result, the pool of\npotential targets with which we could complete an initial business combination may be limited and we may be adversely affected in terms of competing with other\nspecial purpose acquisition companies which do not have similar foreign ownership issues. Moreover, the process of government review, whether by CFIUS or\notherwise, could be lengthy. Because we have only a limited time to complete our initial business combination, our failure to obtain any required approvals within the\nrequisite time period may require us to liquidate. If we liquidate, our public shareholders may only receive $10.20 per public share, and our warrants will expire\nworthless. This will also cause you to lose any potential investment opportunity in a target company and the chance of realizing future gains on your investment\nthrough any price appreciation in the combined company.\n18\nTable of Contents\nIf the proceeds not being held in the Trust Account are insufficient to allow us to operate for at least 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to\nconsummate a business combination is extended) following the closing of our IPO, it could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or\nbusinesses and complete our initial business combination, and we will depend on loans from our sponsor or management team to fund our search and to\ncomplete our initial business combination.\nOf the proceeds of our IPO and the Private Placements, as of December 31, 2022, only approximately $627,628 was available to us initially outside the Trust\nAccount to fund our working capital requirements. We believe that the funds available to us outside of the Trust Account will be sufficient to allow us to operate at\nleast until June 7, 2023 (or September 7, 2023 if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended); however, we cannot assure you that our\nestimate is accurate. Of the funds available to us, we could use a portion of the funds available to us to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target\nbusiness. We could also use a portion of the funds as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target\nbusinesses from “shopping” around for transactions with other companies or investors on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular\nproposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive\nexclusivity from a target business and were subsequently required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise), we might not have sufficient\nfunds to continue searching for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, a target business.\nIf we are required to seek additional capital, we would need to borrow funds from our sponsor, management team or other third parties to operate or may be\nforced to liquidate. Neither our sponsor, members of our management team nor any of their affiliates is under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us. Any\nsuch advances may be repaid only from funds held outside the Trust Account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial business combination. Up to\n$1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The\nwarrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties\nother than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all\nrights to seek access to funds in our Trust Account. If we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period because we do not have\nsufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. Consequently, our public shareholders may only receive an\nestimated $10.20 per public share, or possibly less, on our redemption of our public shares, and our warrants will expire worthless. See “—If third parties bring claims\nagainst us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.20 per\npublic share” and other risk factors herein.\nSubsequent to our completion of our initial business combination, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other\ncharges or file for bankruptcy protection, which could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our\nsecurities, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment\nEven if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business with which we combine, we cannot assure you that this diligence will identify all material\nissues with a particular target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of\nthe target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write- off assets, restructure our\noperations, or incur impairment or other charges or file for bankruptcy protection, which could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully\nidentifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even\nthough these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to\nnegative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be\nsubject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining post-combination debt financing. Accordingly, any\nshareholders or warrant holders who choose to remain shareholders or warrant holders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of\ntheir securities. Such shareholders and warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.\n19\nTable of Contents\nIf third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders\nmay be less than $10.20 per public share.\nOur placing of funds in the Trust Account may not protect those funds from third-party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors, service\nproviders (except our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements\nwith us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public shareholders, such parties may\nnot execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements, they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account, including, but not\nlimited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in\norder to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement\nwaiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our management will consider whether competitive alternatives are reasonably available to the company,\nand will only enter into an agreement with such third party if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be in the best interests of the company\nunder the circumstances. The underwriter of our IPO did not execute an agreement with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account.\nExamples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose\nparticular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases\nwhere management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims\nthey may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for\nany reason.\nUpon redemption of our public shares, if we do not complete our initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a\nredemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may\nbe brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders could be less than the\n$10.20 per public share initially held in the Trust Account, due to claims of such creditors. Pursuant to the letter agreement the form of which is filed as an exhibit to\nthe registration statement, our sponsor has agreed that they will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to\nus, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination\nagreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.20 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the\nTrust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.20 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case\nnet of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target\nbusiness who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any\nclaims under our indemnity of the underwriter of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an\nexecuted waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third- party claims.\nHowever, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient\nfunds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our\nsponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the Trust Account, the funds available for our\ninitial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.20 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business\ncombination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will\nindemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.\n20\nTable of Contents\nOur independent directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the Trust\nAccount available for distribution to our public shareholders.\nIn the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.20 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held\nin the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than $10.20 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in\neach case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no\nindemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its\nindemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its\nindemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary duties may choose\nnot to do so in any particular instance. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the Trust\nAccount available for distribution to our public shareholders may be reduced below $10.20 per public share.\nIf, after we distribute the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or\nwinding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy or insolvency court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board\nof directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims of\npunitive damages.\nIf, after we distribute the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy\nor winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or\nbankruptcy and/or insolvency laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek to\nrecover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors\nand/or having acted in bad faith by paying public shareholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors, thereby exposing itself and us to\nclaims of punitive damages.\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or\nwinding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our shareholders and\nthe per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our shareholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding- up petition or an involuntary\nbankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or\ninsolvency law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent\nany bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our shareholders in connection with our liquidation may\nbe reduced.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and\ncomplete our initial business combination, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we will be required to comply with certain SEC and\nother legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations\nand their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and\nresults of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations.\n21\nTable of Contents\nWe may not hold an annual general meeting until after the consummation of our initial business combination. Our public shareholders do not have the right to\nappoint directors until after the consummation of our initial business combination.\nIn accordance with Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual general meeting until one year after our first fiscal year\nend following our listing on Nasdaq. There is no requirement under the Companies Act for us to hold annual or extraordinary general meetings to appoint directors.\nUntil we hold an annual general meeting, public shareholders may not be afforded the opportunity to discuss company affairs with management. Our board of\ndirectors is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being appointed in each year and each class (except for those directors appointed prior to our\nfirst annual general meeting) serving a three-year term. In addition, as holders of our Class A ordinary shares, our public shareholders do not have the right to vote on\nthe appointment of directors until after the consummation of our initial business combination. In addition, prior to our initial business combination, only holders of our\nClass B ordinary shares have the right to vote on the appointment of directors, including in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and\nholders of a majority of our Class B ordinary shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason. Accordingly, you may not have any say in the\nmanagement of our company prior to the consummation of an initial business combination.\nAlthough we have identified general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, we may enter into our\ninitial business combination with a target that does not meet such criteria and guidelines, and as a result, the target business with which we enter into our initial\nbusiness combination may not have attributes entirely consistent with our general criteria and guidelines.\nAlthough we have identified general criteria and guidelines for evaluating prospective target businesses, it is possible that a target business with which we\nenter into our initial business combination will not meet some or all of these criteria and guidelines. If we complete our initial business combination with a target that\ndoes not meet some or all of these criteria and guidelines, such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a business that does meet all of our\ngeneral criteria and guidelines. In addition, if we announce a prospective business combination with a target that does not meet our general criteria and guidelines, a\ngreater number of shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, which may make it difficult for us to meet any closing condition with a target business that\nrequires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. In addition, if shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock\nexchange listing requirements, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, it may be more difficult for us to attain shareholder approval\nof our initial business combination if the target business does not meet our general criteria and guidelines. If we have not consummated our initial business\ncombination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.20 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the\nliquidation of our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless.\nWe are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent accounting or investment banking firm, and consequently, you may have no assurance from an\nindependent source that the price we are paying for the business is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view.\nUnless we complete our initial business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment\nbanking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such initial business combination or transaction is fair to our company from a financial\npoint of view. If no opinion is obtained, our shareholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will determine fair market value based on\nstandards generally accepted by the financial community. Such standards used will be disclosed in our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable,\nrelated to our initial business combination.\n22\nTable of Contents\nOur ability to successfully effect our initial business combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel,\nsome of whom may join us following our initial business combination. In addition, the officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign upon\ncompletion of our initial business combination. The loss of a business combination target’s key personnel could negatively impact the operations and\nprofitability of our post-combination business. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination\nbusiness.\nOur ability to successfully effect our initial business combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. The role of our key personnel in the\ntarget business, however, cannot presently be ascertained. Although some of our key personnel may remain with the target business in senior management, director\nor advisory positions following our initial business combination, it is likely that some or all of the management of the target business will remain in place. While we\nintend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after our initial business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove\nto be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a company regulated by the SEC, which could cause us to have to expend time\nand resources helping them become familiar with such requirements.\nIn addition, the directors and officers of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of our initial business combination. The departure of a\nbusiness combination target’s key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. The role of an acquisition\ncandidate’s key personnel upon the completion of our initial business combination cannot be ascertained at this time. Although we contemplate that certain members\nof an acquisition candidate’s management team will remain associated with the acquisition candidate following our initial business combination, it is possible that\nmembers of the management of an acquisition candidate will not wish to remain in place. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and\nprofitability of our post-combination business.\nOur key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination, and a\nparticular business combination may be conditioned on the retention or resignation of such key personnel. These agreements may provide for them to receive\ncompensation following our initial business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular\nbusiness combination is the most advantageous.\nOur key personnel may be able to remain with our company after the completion of our initial business combination only if they are able to negotiate\nemployment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the\nbusiness combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would\nrender to us after the completion of the business combination. Such negotiations also could make such key personnel’s retention or resignation a condition to any\nsuch agreement. The personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, subject to his or\nher fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. However, we believe the ability of such individuals to remain with us after the completion of our initial business\ncombination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. There is no certainty,\nhowever, that any of our key personnel will remain with us after the completion of our initial business combination. We cannot assure you that any of our key\npersonnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with us. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with us will be made\nat the time of our initial business combination.\nWe may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective target business and, as a result, may effect our initial business combination with a target\nbusiness whose management may not have the skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company.\nWhen evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target business’s\nmanagement may be limited due to a lack of time, resources or information. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target business’s management, therefore, may\nprove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we suspected. Should the target business’s management not possess the\nskills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company, the operations and profitability of the post-combination business may be negatively impacted.\nAccordingly, any shareholders or warrant holders who choose to remain shareholders or warrant holders following the business combination could suffer a reduction\nin the value of their securities. Such shareholders and warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.\n23\nTable of Contents\nCertain of our officers and directors have or will have direct and indirect economic interests in us and/or our sponsor and such interests may potentially conflict\nwith those of our public shareholders as we evaluate and decide whether to recommend a potential business combination to our public shareholders.\nCertain of our officers and directors may own membership interests in our sponsor and indirect interests in our Class B ordinary shares and private placement\nwarrants which may result in interests that differ from the economic interests of the investors in our IPO, which includes making a determination of whether a particular\ntarget business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. There may be a potential conflict of interest between our officers\nand directors that hold membership interests in our sponsor and our public shareholders that may not be resolved in favor of our public shareholders.\nOur executive officers and directors will allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to\ndevote to our affairs. This conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination.\nOur executive officers and directors are not required to, and will not, commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating\ntheir time between our operations and our search for a business combination and their other businesses. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the\ncompletion of our initial business combination. Each of our executive officers is engaged in several other business endeavors for which he may be entitled to\nsubstantial compensation, and our executive officers are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours per week to our affairs. Our independent directors\nalso serve as officers and board members for other entities. If our executive officers’ and directors’ other business affairs require them to devote substantial amounts\nof time to such affairs in excess of their current commitment levels, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs which may have a negative impact on our\nability to complete our initial business combination.\nCertain of our officers and directors are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those\nintended to be conducted by us, including other blank check companies, and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time and determining\nto which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.\nUntil we consummate our initial business combination, we intend to engage in the business of identifying and combining with one or more businesses. Our\nsponsor and officers and directors are, and may in the future become, affiliated with entities that are engaged in a similar business. In addition, our sponsor, officers\nand directors may participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company prior to completion of our initial business\ncombination. As a result, our sponsor, officers or directors could have conflicts of interest in determining whether to present business combination opportunities to\nus or to any other blank check company with which they may become involved. However, we do not believe that any potential conflicts would materially affect our\nability to complete our initial business combination.\nOur officers and directors also may become aware of business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us and the other entities to which\nthey owe certain fiduciary or contractual duties.\nAccordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. These conflicts may\nnot be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us. Our amended and restated memorandum\nand articles of association provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except\nand to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and\n(ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate\nopportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other.\n24\nTable of Contents\nWe may engage in a business combination with one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our sponsor,\nexecutive officers or directors which may raise potential conflicts of interest.\nIn light of the involvement of our sponsor, executive officers and directors with other entities, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated\nwith our sponsor, executive officers or directors. Our directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities. In addition, our sponsor and our officers\nand directors may sponsor or form other special purpose acquisition companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period\nin which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an\ninitial business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target. However, we do not believe that any\npotential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Such entities may compete with us for business combination\nopportunities. Our sponsor, officers and directors are not currently aware of any specific opportunities for us to complete our initial business combination with any\nentities with which they are affiliated, and there have been no substantive discussions concerning a business combination with any such entity or entities. Despite\nour agreement to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm regarding the fairness\nto our company from a financial point of view of a business combination with one or more domestic or international businesses affiliated with our sponsor, executive\nofficers or directors, potential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the business combination may not be as advantageous to our public\nshareholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest.\nSince our sponsor, executive officers and directors will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed (other than with\nrespect to public shares they may acquire), a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our\ninitial business combination.\nAs of March 30, 2023, our initial shareholders, Apollo and members of our management team held an aggregate of 4,743,750 Class B ordinary shares. The\nfounder shares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination. In addition, as of March 30, 2023 our sponsor and Apollo held an aggregate of\n9,225,000 private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share (subject to adjustment). 9,125,000 private placement\nwarrants are held by our sponsor and 100,000 private placement warrants are held by Apollo. If we do not complete our initial business combination before June 7,\n2023 (or September 7, 2023 if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended), the private placement warrants will expire worthless. In the event\nthat our sponsor deems it necessary in order to facilitate our initial business combination for the sponsor to forfeit, transfer, exchange or amend the terms of all or any\nportion of the private placement warrants or to enter into any other arrangements with respect to the private placement warrants (including, without limitation, a\ntransfer of the sponsor’s membership interests representing an interest in the private placement warrants) to facilitate the consummation of such business\ncombination, such change shall apply pro rata to Apollo and our sponsor based on the relative number of private placement warrants held by each. By way of\nexample, in the event 50% of the sponsor’s private placement warrants are forfeited or transferred by the sponsor as part of such business combination, Apollo shall\nforfeit or transfer 50% of its private placement warrants on substantially the same terms and conditions as the sponsor, in which case the reduction shall equal 50% of\nthe private placement warrants held by Apollo at such time. The personal and financial interests of our executive officers and directors may influence their motivation\nin identifying and selecting a target business combination, completing an initial business combination and influencing the operation of the business following the\ninitial business combination. This risk may become more acute as the deadline for completing of an initial business combination nears.\nConcentration of ownership among our sponsor and Apollo may prevent other investors from influencing significant corporate decisions or adversely affect the\ntrading price of our public shares.\nOur sponsor, Apollo and members of our management team own collectively 28.73% of our outstanding ordinary shares. As a result, our sponsor and Apollo\ncould exercise significant influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval. This potential concentration of influence could be disadvantageous to other\nshareholders with interests different from those of our sponsor or Apollo. In addition, this potential significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect\nthe trading price of our public shares because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with principal shareholders. Furthermore, the\nUnits (including the underlying public shares and warrants) Apollo may purchase in the open market will not be subject to any agreements restricting their transfer,\nand therefore sales of such securities on the open market may adversely affect the prevailing market prices for our units, Class A Ordinary Shares or warrants, as\napplicable.\n25\nTable of Contents\nWe may only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of our IPO and Private Placements, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a\nsingle business which may have a limited number of products or services. This lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations and profitability.\nAs of March 30, 2023, the Trust Account held $193,545,000 in funds available to complete our initial business combination (which includes $6,641,250 of\ndeferred underwriting commissions being held in the Trust Account).\nWe may effectuate our initial business combination with a single-target business or multiple-target businesses simultaneously or within a short period of\ntime. However, we may not be able to effectuate our initial business combination with more than one target business because of various factors, including the\nexistence of complex accounting issues and the requirement that we prepare and file pro forma financial statements with the SEC that present operating results and the\nfinancial condition of several target businesses as if they had been operated on a combined basis. By completing our initial business combination with only a single\nentity, our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments. Further, we would not be able to diversify our\noperations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business\ncombinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be:\n• solely dependent upon the performance of a single business, property or asset; or\n• dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.\nThis lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse\nimpact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial business combination.\nWe may attempt to simultaneously complete business combinations with multiple prospective targets, which may hinder our ability to complete our initial\nbusiness combination and give rise to increased costs and risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability.\nIf we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses that are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our\npurchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability,\nto complete our initial business combination. With multiple business combinations, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with\nrespect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent\nassimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business. If we are unable to adequately address these risks, it\ncould negatively impact our profitability and results of operations.\nWe may attempt to complete our initial business combination with a private company about which little information is available, which may result in a business\ncombination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all.\nIn pursuing our business combination strategy, we may seek to effectuate our initial business combination with a privately held company. Very little public\ninformation generally exists about private companies, and we could be required to make our decision on whether to pursue a potential initial business combination on\nthe basis of limited information, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all.\n26\nTable of Contents\nOur management may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of\ncontrol of a target business, new management will possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business.\nWe may structure our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own\nless than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company\nowns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for us not\nto be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Even if\nthe post-business combination company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our initial business combination may\ncollectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination.\nFor example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new Class A ordinary shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding\ncapital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new Class A\nordinary shares, our shareholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding Class A ordinary shares subsequent to\nsuch transaction. In addition, other minority shareholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of\nthe company’s shares than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain our control of the target\nbusiness.\nWe do not have a specified maximum redemption threshold. The absence of such a redemption threshold may make it possible for us to complete our initial\nbusiness combination with which a substantial majority of our shareholders do not agree.\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association do not provide a specified maximum redemption threshold, except that in no event will we\nredeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon completion of our initial business combination (such\nthat we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). As a result, we may be able to complete our initial business combination even though a substantial majority\nof our public shareholders do not agree with the transaction and have redeemed their shares or, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination\nand do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, have entered into privately negotiated\nagreements to sell their shares to our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be\nrequired to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of\nthe proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, all\nClass A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination.\nThe provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that relate to our pre-business combination activity (and corresponding\nprovisions of the agreement governing the release of funds from our Trust Account) may be amended with the approval of holders of at least two-thirds of our\nordinary shares who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company (or 65% of our ordinary shares with respect to amendments to the trust agreement\ngoverning the release of funds from our Trust Account), which is a lower amendment threshold than that of some other special purpose acquisition companies. It\nmay be easier for us, therefore, to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to facilitate the completion of an initial business\ncombination that some of our shareholders may not support.\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that any of its provisions related to pre- business combination activity (including\nthe requirement to deposit proceeds of the IPO and the Private Placements into the Trust Account and not release such amounts except in specified circumstances,\nand to provide redemption rights to public shareholders as described herein) may be amended if approved by special resolution, meaning holders of at least two-thirds\nof our ordinary shares who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company, and corresponding provisions of the trust agreement governing the release of funds\nfrom our Trust Account may be amended if approved by holders of not less than 65% of our ordinary shares; provided that the provisions of our amended and\nrestated memorandum and articles of association relating to the rights of holders of Class B ordinary shares to appoint or remove directors prior to our initial business\ncombination may only be amended by a special resolution passed by a majority of at least 90% our ordinary shares voting in a general meeting. Our initial\nshareholders, Apollo and members of our management team , who collectively beneficially own 28.73% of our ordinary shares, will participate in any vote to amend\nour amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and/or trust agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. As a result,\nwe may be able to amend the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association which govern our pre-business combination behavior\nmore easily than some other special purpose acquisition companies, and this may increase our ability to complete a business combination with which you do not\nagree. Our shareholders may pursue remedies against us for any breach of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association.\n27\nTable of Contents\nOur sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to agreements with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and\nrestated memorandum and articles of association (i) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in\nconnection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination before June 7,\n2023 (or September 7, 2023 if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’\nrights or pre-initial combination activity, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares upon approval of any\nsuch amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (net of taxes paid or\npayable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. Our shareholders are not parties to, or third-party beneficiaries of these agreements and, as a\nresult, will not have the ability to pursue remedies against our sponsor, executive officer or directors for any breach of these agreements. As a result, in the event of a\nbreach, our shareholders would need to pursue a shareholder derivative action, subject to applicable law.\nA provision of our warrant agreement may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination.\nUnlike some blank check companies, if:\n(i) we issue additional ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of our initial business\ncombination at a newly issued price (such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by our board of directors and, in the\ncase of any issuance to our sponsor, Apollo or their affiliates, without taking into account any founder shares held by our sponsor, Apollo or such\naffiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the “Newly Issued Price”) of less than $9.20 per ordinary share;\n(ii) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the\nfunding of our initial business combination on the date of the completion of our initial business combination (net of redemptions); and\n(iii) the volume weighted average trading price of our Class A ordinary shares during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the\nday on which we consummate our initial business combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.20 per share,\nthen the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, the $10.00 per share\nredemption trigger price will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the $18.00 per share\nredemption trigger price will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price. This may make it more\ndifficult for us to consummate an initial business combination with a target business.\n28\nTable of Contents\nBecause we must furnish our shareholders with target business financial statements, we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial\nbusiness combination with some prospective target businesses.\nThe federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include\nhistorical and/or pro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with our tender\noffer documents, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be\nreconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America or GAAP, or international financial reporting standards as issued by the\nInternational Accounting Standards Board, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in\naccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the\npool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in\naccordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame.\nTransactions in connection with or in anticipation of our initial business combination and our structure thereafter may not be tax-efficient to our shareholders\nand warrant-holders. As a result of our business combination, our tax obligations may be more complex, burdensome and uncertain.\nAlthough we will attempt to structure transactions in connection with our initial business combination in a tax- efficient manner, tax structuring\nconsiderations are complex, the relevant facts and law are uncertain and may change, and we may prioritize commercial and other considerations over tax\nconsiderations. For example, in anticipation of or as a result of our initial business combination and subject to requisite shareholder approval, we may enter into one or\nmore transactions that require shareholders and/or warrant-holders to recognize gain or income for tax purposes or otherwise increase their tax burden. We do not\nintend to make any cash distributions to shareholders or warrant- holders to pay taxes in connection with our business combination or thereafter. Accordingly, a\nshareholder or a warrant-holder may be required to satisfy any liability resulting from any such transactions with cash from its own funds or by selling all or a portion\nof such holder’s shares or warrants. In addition, we may effect a business combination with a target company in another jurisdiction (including, but not limited to, the\njurisdiction in which the target company or business is located). As a result, shareholders and warrant-holders may be subject to additional income, withholding or\nother taxes with respect to their ownership of us after our initial business combination.\nRisks Associated With Acquiring and Operating a Business in Foreign Countries\nIf we pursue a target company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States for our initial business combination, we may face additional burdens\nin connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing such initial business combination, and if we effect such initial business combination, we would be\nsubject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations.\nIf we pursue a target a company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States for our initial business combination, we would be subject to\nrisks associated with cross-border business combinations, including in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing our initial business combination,\nconducting due diligence in a foreign jurisdiction, having such transaction approved by any local governments, regulators or agencies and changes in the purchase\nprice based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nIf we effect our initial business combination with such a company, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated with companies\noperating in an international setting, including any of the following:\n• costs and difficulties inherent in managing cross-border business operations;\n• rules and regulations regarding currency redemption;\n• complex corporate withholding taxes on individuals;\n• laws governing the manner in which future business combinations may be effected;\n• exchange listing and/or delisting requirements;\n• tariffs and trade barriers;\n29\nTable of Contents\n• regulations related to customs and import/export matters;\n• local or regional economic policies and market conditions;\n• unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n• challenges in managing and staffing international operations;\n• longer payment cycles;\n• tax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States;\n• currency fluctuations and exchange controls;\n• rates of inflation;\n• challenges in collecting accounts receivable;\n• cultural and language differences;\n• employment regulations;\n• underdeveloped or unpredictable legal or regulatory systems;\n• corruption;\n• protection of intellectual property;\n• social unrest, crime, strikes, riots, civil disturbances and wars;\n• regime changes and political upheaval; and\n• deterioration of political relations with the United States.\nWe may not be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we were unable to do so, we may be unable to complete such initial business\ncombination, or, if we complete such initial business combination, our operations might suffer, either of which may adversely impact our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nRisks Relating to our Securities\nThe securities in which we invest the funds held in the Trust Account could bear a negative rate of interest, which could reduce the value of the assets held in trust\nsuch that the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders may be less than $10.20 per share.\nThe proceeds held in the Trust Account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market\nfunds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. While short-\nterm U.S. government treasury obligations currently yield a positive rate of interest, they have briefly yielded negative interest rates in recent years. Central banks in\nEurope and Japan pursued interest rates below zero in recent years, and the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve has not ruled out the possibility that it\nmay in the future adopt similar policies in the United States. In the event that we are unable to complete our initial business combination or make certain amendments\nto our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, our public shareholders are entitled to receive their pro-rata share of the proceeds held in the\nTrust Account, plus any interest income, net of taxes paid or payable (less, in the case we are unable to complete our initial business combination, $100,000 of\ninterest). Negative interest rates could reduce the value of the assets held in trust such that the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders may be\nless than $10.20 per share.\n30\nTable of Contents\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our\nactivities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activities may be restricted, including:\n• restrictions on the nature of our investments; and\n• restrictions on the issuance of securities;\neach of which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. In addition, we may have imposed upon us burdensome requirements,\nincluding:\n• registration as an investment company with the SEC;\n• adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and\n• reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations that we are currently not subject to.\nIn order not to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we must ensure that we\nare engaged primarily in a business other than investing, reinvesting or trading of securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting, owning,\nholding or trading “investment securities” constituting more than 40% of our assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated\nbasis. Our business will be to identify and complete a business combination and thereafter to operate the post-business combination business or assets for the long\nterm. We do not plan to buy businesses or assets with a view to resale or profit from their resale. We do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a\npassive investor.\nWe do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in the Trust\nAccount may only be invested in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of\n185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct\nU.S. government treasury obligations. Pursuant to the trust agreement, the trustee is not permitted to invest in other securities or assets. By restricting the investment\nof the proceeds to these instruments, and by having a business plan targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and\nselling businesses in the manner of a merchant bank or private equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an “investment company” within the meaning of the\nInvestment Company Act. Our securities are not intended for persons who are seeking a return on investments in government securities or investment securities. The\nTrust Account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of either: (i) the completion of our initial business combination; (ii) the redemption\nof any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (a) that\nwould affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to\nredeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination before June 7, 2023 (or September 7, 2023 if the period of time to\nconsummate a business combination is extended), or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination\nactivity; or (iii) absent an initial business combination before June 7, 2023 (or September 7, 2023 if the period of time to consummate a business combination is\nextended), our return of the funds held in the Trust Account to our public shareholders as part of our redemption of the public shares. If we do not invest the\nproceeds as discussed above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act,\ncompliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to complete a\nbusiness combination. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only\napproximately $10.20 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless.\n31\nTable of Contents\nIf we do not consummate our initial business combination before June 7, 2023 (or September 7, 2023 if the period of time to consummate a business combination\nis extended), our public shareholders may be forced to wait beyond such applicable period before redemption from our Trust Account\nIf we do not consummate our initial business combination before June 7, 2023 (or September 7, 2023 if the period of time to consummate a business\ncombination is extended), the proceeds then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of\ntaxes paid or payable), will be used to fund the redemption of our public shares, as further described herein. Any redemption of public shareholders from the Trust\nAccount will be effected automatically by function of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association prior to any voluntary winding up. If we are\nrequired to wind-up, liquidate the Trust Account and distribute such amount therein, pro rata, to our public shareholders, as part of any liquidation process, such\nwinding up, liquidation and distribution must comply with the applicable provisions of the Companies Act. In that case, investors may be forced to wait beyond the\napplicable period before the redemption proceeds of our Trust Account become available to them, and they receive the return of their pro rata portion of the proceeds\nfrom our Trust Account. We have no obligation to return funds to investors prior to the date of our redemption or liquidation unless, prior thereto, we consummate\nour initial business combination or amend certain provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, and only then in cases where\ninvestors have sought to redeem their Class A ordinary shares. Only upon our redemption or any liquidation will public shareholders be entitled to distributions if we\ndo not complete our initial business combination and do not amend certain provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Our\namended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business\ncombination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the Trust Account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10\nbusiness days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law.\nOur shareholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares.\nIf we are forced to enter into an insolvent liquidation, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed as an unlawful payment if it was proved\nthat immediately following the date on which the distribution was made, we were unable to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. As a\nresult, a liquidator could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our directors may be viewed as having breached their\nfiduciary duties to us or our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing themselves and our company to claims, by paying public shareholders\nfrom the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. We and our\ndirectors and officers who knowingly and willfully authorized or permitted any distribution to be paid out of our share premium account while we were unable to pay\nour debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business would be guilty of an offence and may be liable for a fine of approximately $18,000 and imprisonment for\nfive years in the Cayman Islands.\n32\nTable of Contents\nWe have not registered the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and such\nregistration may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its warrants except on a\ncashless basis and potentially causing such warrants to expire worthless.\nWe have not registered the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. However,\nunder the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed that, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days after the closing of our initial\nbusiness combination, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the issuance of such shares, and we will\nuse our commercially reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement to become effective within 60 business days after the closing of our initial business\ncombination and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares until the warrants\nexpire or are redeemed. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if, for example, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the\ninformation set forth in the registration statement or prospectus, the financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current, complete or\ncorrect or the SEC issues a stop order. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act in accordance with the above\nrequirements, we will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, in which case, the number of Class A ordinary shares that you will\nreceive upon cashless exercise will be based on a formula subject to a maximum amount of shares equal to 0.361 Class A ordinary shares per warrant (subject to\nadjustment). However, no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise\ntheir warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an\nexemption from registration is available. Notwithstanding the above, if our Class A ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national\nsecurities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of\npublic warrants who seek to exercise their warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event we so\nelect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares\nunder applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. Exercising the warrants on a cashless basis could have the effect of reducing the potential\n“upside” of the holder’s investment in our company because the warrant holder will hold a smaller number of Class A ordinary shares upon a cashless exercise of the\nwarrants they hold. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant, or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event\nthat we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under applicable state securities laws and no exemption is available. If the issuance of the\nshares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holder of such warrant shall not be entitled to\nexercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of Units will\nhave paid the full unit purchase price solely for the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units. There may be a circumstance where an exemption from registration\nexists for holders of our private placement warrants to exercise their warrants while a corresponding exemption does not exist for holders of the public warrants. In\nsuch an instance, our sponsor, Apollo and their permitted transferees (which may include our directors and executive officers) would be able to exercise their warrants\nand sell the ordinary shares underlying their warrants while holders of our public warrants would not be able to exercise their warrants and sell the underlying ordinary\nshares. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying Class A\nordinary shares for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem the warrants as set forth above even if the holders are otherwise unable\nto exercise their warrants.\nThe warrants may become exercisable and redeemable for a security other than the Class A ordinary shares, and you will not have any information regarding\nsuch other security at this time.\nIn certain situations, including if we are not the surviving entity in our initial business combination, the warrants may become exercisable for a security other\nthan the Class A ordinary shares. As a result, if the surviving company redeems your warrants for securities pursuant to the warrant agreement, you may receive a\nsecurity in a company of which you do not have information at this time. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, the surviving company will be required to use\ncommercially reasonable efforts to register the issuance of the security underlying the warrants within 20 business days of the closing of an initial business\ncombination.\nCertain of our warrants are accounted for as a warrant liability and are recorded at fair value upon issuance with changes in fair value each period reported in\nearnings, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our ordinary shares or may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business\ncombination.\nWe have accounted for the 18,712,500 warrants issued in our IPO (the 9,487,500 public warrants and the 9,225,000 private placement warrants) in accordance\nwith the guidance contained in Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (ASC 815-40). Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not\nmeet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each warrant must be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, we classify each warrant as a liability at its fair value. This\nliability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in\nfair value recognized in our statement of operations and therefore our reported earnings. The warrants are also subject to re- evaluation of the proper classification\nand accounting treatment at each reporting period based on evolving regulatory guidance. The impact of changes in fair value on earnings may have an adverse effect\non the market price of our ordinary shares. In addition, potential targets may seek a SPAC that does not have warrants that are accounted for as a warrant liability,\nwhich may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination with a target business.\n33\nTable of Contents\nThe grant of registration rights to our initial shareholders and holders of our private placement warrants may make it more difficult to complete our initial\nbusiness combination, and the future exercise of such rights may adversely affect the market price of our Class A ordinary shares.\nWe have entered into an agreement pursuant to which our initial shareholders and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the resale of the\nClass A ordinary shares into which founder shares are convertible, holders of our private placement warrants and their permitted transferees can demand that we\nregister the private placement warrants and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants and holders of warrants that may be\nissued upon conversion of working capital loans may demand that we register such warrants or the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of such\nwarrants. The registration rights will be exercisable with respect to the founder shares and the private placement warrants and the Class A ordinary shares issuable\nupon exercise of such private placement warrants. We will bear the cost of registering these securities. The registration and availability of such a significant number of\nsecurities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares. In addition, the existence of the registration\nrights may make our initial business combination more costly or difficult to conclude. This is because the shareholders of the target business may increase the equity\nstake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of our securities that is expected when the\nsecurities owned by our initial shareholders, holders of our private placement warrants or their respective permitted transferees are registered for resale.\nBecause we are neither limited to evaluating a target business in a particular industry sector nor have we selected any specific target businesses with which to\npursue our initial business combination, you will be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of any particular target business’s operations.\nWe may pursue business combination opportunities in any sector, except that we are not, under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of\nassociation, permitted to effectuate our initial business combination solely with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. Because\nwe have not yet selected or approached any specific target business with respect to a business combination, there is no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks\nof any particular target business’s operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition or prospects. To the extent we complete our initial\nbusiness combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which we combine. For example, if we combine with a\nfinancially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations\nof a financially unstable or a development stage entity. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business,\nwe cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence.\nFurthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a\ntarget business. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our Units will ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such\nopportunity were available, in a business combination target. Accordingly, any shareholders or warrant holders who choose to remain shareholders or warrant holders\nfollowing the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such shareholders and warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for\nsuch reduction in value.\nWe may seek business combination opportunities in industries or sectors which may or may not be outside of our management’s areas of expertise.\nWe will consider a business combination outside of our management’s area of expertise if a business combination candidate is presented to us and we\ndetermine that such candidate offers an attractive acquisition opportunity for our company. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in\nany particular business combination candidate, we cannot assure you that we will adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. We also cannot\nassure you that an investment in our Units will not ultimately prove to be less favorable than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in a business\ncombination candidate. In the event we elect to pursue an acquisition outside of the areas of our management’s expertise, our management’s expertise may not be\ndirectly applicable to its evaluation or operation, and the information contained in this report regarding the areas of our management’s expertise would not be relevant\nto an understanding of the business that we elect to acquire. As a result, our management may not be able to adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk\nfactors. Accordingly, any shareholders or warrant holders who choose to remain shareholders or warrant holders following the business combination could suffer a\nreduction in the value of their securities. Such shareholders and warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.\n34\nTable of Contents\nWe may issue additional Class A ordinary shares or preference shares to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after\ncompletion of our initial business combination. We may also issue Class A ordinary shares upon the conversion of the founder shares at a ratio greater than one-\nto-one concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination as a result of the anti-dilution provisions contained in\nour amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our shareholders and likely present other\nrisks.\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association authorize the issuance of up to 200,000,000 Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per\nshare, 20,000,000 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, and 1,000,000 preference shares, par value $0.0001 per share. As of March 30, 2023, there were\n181,025,000 and 15,875,000 authorized but unissued Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares, respectively, available for issuance, which amount does not\ntake into account shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of issued and outstanding warrants or shares issuable upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares.\nThe Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial\nbusiness combination, or earlier at the option of the holder thereof. As of March 30, 2023, there were no preference shares outstanding. We may issue a substantial\nnumber of additional Class A ordinary shares or preference shares to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion\nof our initial business combination. We may also issue Class A ordinary shares in connection with our redeeming the warrants or upon conversion of the Class B\nordinary shares at a ratio greater than one-to-one concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination as a result of the\nanti-dilution provisions as set forth herein. However, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide, among other things, that prior to our\ninitial business combination, we may not issue additional shares that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the Trust Account or (ii) vote as a class\nwith our public shares (a) on any initial business combination or (b) to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association\nto extend the time we have to consummate a business combination beyond before June 7, 2023 (or September 7, 2023 if the period of time to consummate a business\ncombination is extended). These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated\nmemorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote. The issuance of additional ordinary or preference shares:\n• may significantly dilute the equity interest of public shareholders, which dilution would increase if the anti-dilution provisions in the Class B ordinary\nshares resulted in the issuance of Class A ordinary shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares;\n• may subordinate the rights of holders of Class A ordinary shares if preference shares are issued with rights senior to those afforded our Class A ordinary\nshares;\n• could cause a change in control if a substantial number of Class A ordinary shares are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use\nour net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors;\n• may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain\ncontrol of us;\n• may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Units, Class A ordinary shares and/or warrants; and\n• may not result in adjustment to the exercise price of our warrants.\n35\nTable of Contents\nUnlike some other similarly structured special purpose acquisition companies, our initial shareholders will receive additional Class A ordinary shares if we issue\nshares to consummate an initial business combination.\nThe founder shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial\nbusiness combination, or earlier at the option of the holder thereof, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for share subdivisions, share dividends, rights\nissuances, reorganizations, recapitalizations and other similar transactions, and subject to further adjustment as provided herein. However, if additional Class A\nordinary shares or any other equity-linked securities are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts issued in our IPO and related to the closing of our initial\nbusiness combination, the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all founder shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis,\n20% of the sum of (i) the total number of ordinary shares outstanding at our IPO plus (ii) the total number of Class A ordinary shares issued, or deemed issued or\nissuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the company in connection with or in relation to the\nconsummation of the initial business combination, excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A\nordinary shares issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial business combination and any private placement warrants issued to our sponsor upon conversion of\nworking capital loans, provided that such conversion of Class B ordinary shares will never occur on a less than one-for-one basis. This is different than some other\nsimilarly structured special purpose acquisition companies in which the initial shareholders will only be issued an aggregate of 20% of the total number of shares to be\noutstanding prior to the initial business combination.\nResources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire\nor merge with another business. If we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may only receive\nonly approximately $10.20 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our Trust Account, and our warrants will expire worthless.\nWe anticipate that the investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure\ndocuments and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we decide not\nto complete a specific initial business combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, if we\nreach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to complete our initial business combination for any number of reasons including those beyond\nour control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire\nor merge with another business. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive\nonly approximately $10.20 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless.\nAn investment in our securities, and certain subsequent transactions with respect to our securities, may result in uncertain or adverse U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences for an investor\nAn investment in our securities, and certain subsequent transactions with respect to our securities, may result in uncertain U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences for an investor. For instance, because there are no authorities that directly address the U.S. federal income tax implications of instruments similar to our\nUnits, the allocation an investor makes with respect to the purchase price of a unit between the Class A ordinary shares and the one-half of one warrant to purchase\none Class A ordinary share included in each unit could be challenged by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or the courts. Furthermore, the U.S. federal income tax\nconsequences of a cashless exercise of warrants is unclear under current law. Finally, it is unclear whether the redemption rights with respect to our Class A ordinary\nshares suspend the running of a U.S. Holder’s holding period for purposes of determining whether any gain or loss realized by such holder on the sale or exchange of\nClass A ordinary shares is long-term capital gain or loss and for determining whether any dividend we pay would be considered “qualified dividends” eligible for\nfavorable U.S. federal income tax treatment. See the section of this report captioned “Taxation-United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” for a summary of the\nU.S. federal income tax considerations of an investment in our securities. Prospective investors are urged to consult with and rely on their tax advisors with respect to\nthese and other tax consequences when purchasing, holding or disposing of our securities.\n36\nTable of Contents\nWe may be a passive foreign investment company, or “PFIC,” which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. investors.\nIf we are a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. Holder of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants, the\nU.S. Holder may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences and may be subject to additional reporting requirements. Our PFIC status for our current\nand subsequent taxable years may depend on, among other things, whether we qualify for the PFIC start-up exception, the timing of our business combination, the\namount of our passive income and assets in the year of the business combination, and the amount of passive income and assets of the acquired business. Our actual\nPFIC status for our current taxable year or any subsequent taxable year will not be determinable until after the end of such taxable year (and in the case of our start-up\nyear, possibly not until after the close of the second taxable year following our start-up year). Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will not be a PFIC in our\ncurrent taxable year or in any future taxable year.\nIf we determine we are a PFIC for any taxable year, upon written request by a U.S. Holder, we will endeavor to provide to a U.S. Holder such information as the\nIRS may require, including a PFIC annual information statement, in order to enable the U.S. Holder to make and maintain a “qualified electing fund” (“QEF”) election,\nbut there can be no assurance that we will timely provide such required information, and such election would be unavailable with respect to our warrants in all cases.\nThe rules dealing with PFICs and with the QEF election are very complex and are affected by various factors in addition to those described in this report. Accordingly,\nU.S. investors are strongly urged to consult with and rely solely upon their own tax advisors regarding the application of the PFIC rules to them in their particular\ncircumstances.\nWe are subject to changing law and regulations regarding regulatory mailers, corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs\nand the risk of non-compliance.\nWe are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies, including, for example, the SEC, which are charged with the protection of investors and\nthe oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded, and to new and evolving regulatory measures under applicable law. Our efforts to comply with new\nand changing laws and regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of\nmanagement time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nMoreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new\nguidance becomes available. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing\nrevisions to our disclosure and governance practices. If we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes, we may be subject to\npenalty and our business may be harmed.\nWe may reincorporate in another jurisdiction in connection with our initial business combination and such reincorporation may result in taxes imposed on\nshareholders or warrant holders.\nWe may, in connection with our initial business combination and subject to requisite shareholder approval under the Companies Act, reincorporate in the\njurisdiction in which the target company or business is located or in another jurisdiction. The transaction may require a shareholder or warrant holder to recognize\ntaxable income in the jurisdiction in which the shareholder or warrant holder is a tax resident or in which its members are resident if it is a tax transparent entity. We do\nnot intend to make any cash distributions to shareholders or warrant holder to pay such taxes. Shareholders or warrant holder may be subject to withholding taxes or\nother taxes with respect to their ownership of us after the reincorporation.\nAfter our initial business combination, it is possible that a majority of our directors and officers will live outside the United States and all of our assets will be\nlocated outside the United States; therefore, investors may not be able to enforce federal securities laws or their other legal rights.\nIt is possible that after our initial business combination, a majority of our directors and officers will reside outside of the United States and all of our assets\nwill be located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult, or in some cases not possible, for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights,\nto effect service of process upon all of our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties\non our directors and officers under United States laws.\n37\nTable of Contents\nWe may issue notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial debt, to complete a business combination, which may adversely affect our leverage and\nfinancial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our shareholders’ investment in us.\nAlthough we have no commitments as of the date of this report to issue any notes or other debt securities, or to otherwise incur outstanding debt, we may\nchoose to incur substantial debt to complete our initial business combination. We and our officers have agreed that we will not incur any indebtedness unless we\nhave obtained from the lender a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to the monies held in the Trust Account. As such, no issuance of debt will\naffect the per share amount available for redemption from the Trust Account. Nevertheless, the incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including:\n• default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;\n• acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants\nthat require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;\n• our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt is payable on demand;\n• our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt contains covenants restricting\n• our ability to obtain such financing while the debt is outstanding;\n• our inability to pay dividends on our Class A ordinary shares;\n• using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our Class A\nordinary shares if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n• limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;\n• increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation or\nprevailing interest rates; and\n• limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our\nstrategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.\nWe may seek business combination opportunities with a high degree of complexity that require significant operational improvements, which could delay or\nprevent us from achieving our desired results.\nWe may seek business combination opportunities with large, highly complex companies that we believe would benefit from operational improvements. While\nwe intend to implement such improvements, to the extent that our efforts are delayed or we are unable to achieve the desired improvements, the business combination\nmay not be as successful as we anticipate. To the extent we complete our initial business combination with a large complex business or entity with a complex operating\nstructure, we may also be affected by numerous risks inherent in the operations of the business with which we combine, which could delay or prevent us from\nimplementing our strategy. Although our management team will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business and its operations, we may not\nbe able to properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors until we complete our business combination. If we are not able to achieve our desired\noperational improvements, or the improvements take longer to implement than anticipated, we may not achieve the gains that we anticipate. Furthermore, some of\nthese risks and complexities may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks and complexities will adversely\nimpact a target business. Such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a smaller, less complex organization.\n38\nTable of Contents\nIn order to effectuate an initial business combination, special purpose acquisition companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their\ncharters and other governing instruments, including their warrant agreements. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our amended and restated\nmemorandum and articles of association or governing instruments in a manner that will make it easier for us to complete an initial business combination that\nsome of our shareholders may not support.\nIn order to effectuate a business combination, special purpose acquisition companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters\nand governing instruments, including their warrant agreements. For example, special purpose acquisition companies have amended the definition of business\ncombination, increased redemption thresholds and extended the time to consummate an initial business combination and, with respect to their warrants, amended their\nwarrant agreements to require the warrants to be exchanged for cash and/or other securities. Amending our amended and restated memorandum and articles of\nassociation requires at least a special resolution of our shareholders as a matter of Cayman Islands law, meaning the approval of holders of at least two- thirds of our\nordinary shares who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company, and amending our warrant agreement in a manner that would adversely impact the\nregistered holders of public warrants will require a vote of holders of at least 50% of the public warrants and, solely with respect to any amendment to the terms of the\nprivate placement warrants or any provision of the warrant agreement with respect to the private placement warrants, at least 50% of the then issued and outstanding\nprivate placement warrants. In addition, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association require us to provide our public shareholders with the\nopportunity to redeem their public shares for cash if we propose an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (i) that would\naffect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem\n100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination before June 7, 2023 (or September 7, 2023 if the period of time to consummate a\nbusiness combination is extended), or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity. To the extent\nany of such amendments would be deemed to fundamentally change the nature of any of our publicly offered securities, we would register, or seek an exemption from\nregistration for, the affected securities. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or\ngoverning instruments or extend the time to consummate an initial business combination in order to effectuate our initial business combination.\nOur letter agreement with our initial shareholders, officers, directors and Apollo and registration rights agreement may be amended, and provisions therein may\nbe waived, without shareholder approval.\nOur letter agreement with our initial shareholders, officers, directors and Apollo contains provisions relating to transfer restrictions of our founder shares and\nprivate placement warrants, indemnification of the Trust Account, waiver of redemption rights and participation in liquidating distributions from the Trust Account.\nThe letter agreement and the registration rights agreement may be amended, and provisions therein may be waived, without shareholder approval (although releasing\nthe parties from the restriction contained in the letter agreement not to transfer any Units, warrants, Class A ordinary shares or any other securities convertible into, or\nexercisable, or exchangeable for, Class A ordinary shares for 180 days following the date of the prospectus for our IPO will require the prior written consent of\nNeedham & Company, LLC). While we do not expect our board to approve any amendment to or waiver of the letter agreement or registration rights agreement prior to\nour initial business combination, it may be possible that our board, in exercising its business judgment and subject to its fiduciary duties, chooses to approve one or\nmore amendments to or waivers of such agreements. Any such amendments or waivers would not require approval from our shareholders and may have an adverse\neffect on the value of an investment in our securities.\n39\nTable of Contents\nWe may be unable to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination or to fund the operations and growth of a target business, which\ncould compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required\ntime period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.20 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our Trust\nAccount and our warrants will expire worthless.\nAlthough we believe that the net proceeds of our IPO and private placements will be sufficient to allow us to complete our initial business combination, we\ncannot ascertain the capital requirements for any particular transaction because we have not yet selected any prospective target business. If the net proceeds of our\nIPO and the Private Placements prove to be insufficient, either because of the size of our initial business combination, the depletion of the available net proceeds in\nsearch of a target business, the obligation to repurchase for cash a significant number of shares from shareholders who elect redemption in connection with our initial\nbusiness combination, the sale of the forward purchase securities does not close or the terms of negotiated transactions to purchase shares in connection with our\ninitial business combination, we may be required to seek additional financing or to abandon the proposed business combination. We cannot assure you that such\nfinancing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The current economic environment may make it difficult for companies to obtain acquisition financing. To the\nextent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to complete our initial business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the\ntransaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. If we have not consummated our initial business\ncombination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.20 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the\nliquidation of our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless. In addition, even if we do not need additional financing to complete our initial business\ncombination, we may require such financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material\nadverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of our officers, directors or shareholders is required to provide any financing to\nus in connection with or after our initial business combination.\nOur initial shareholders control a substantial interest in us and thus may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, potentially in a\nmanner that you do not support.\nAs of March 30, 2023, our initial shareholders, Apollo and members of our management team owned 25.57%of our outstanding ordinary shares. Accordingly,\nthey may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support, including amendments to our amended\nand restated memorandum and articles of association. If our initial shareholders purchase any Units or any additional Class A ordinary shares in the aftermarket or in\nprivately negotiated transactions, this would increase their control. Neither our initial shareholders nor, to our knowledge, any of our officers or directors, have any\ncurrent intention to purchase additional securities. Factors that would be considered in making such additional purchases would include consideration of the current\ntrading price of our Class A ordinary shares. In addition, our board of directors, whose members were appointed by our sponsor, is divided into three classes, each of\nwhich will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being appointed in each year. We may not hold an annual general meeting to\nappoint new directors prior to the completion of our initial business combination, in which case all of the current directors will continue in office until at least the\ncompletion of the business combination. If there is an annual general meeting, as a consequence of our “staggered” board of directors, only a minority of the board of\ndirectors will be considered for appointment and our initial shareholders, because of their ownership position, will have considerable influence regarding the outcome\nfollowing our initial business combination. In addition, prior to our initial business combination, only holders of our Class B ordinary shares have the right to vote on\nthe appointment of directors, including in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and holders of a majority of our Class B ordinary shares\nmay remove a member of the board of directors for any reason. As a result, holders of Class A ordinary shares will not have the right to appoint any directors until\nafter the completion of our initial business combination.

As a result, the exercise price of your warrants could be increased, the exercise period could be shortened and the number of\nClass A ordinary shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant could be decreased, all without your approval.\nOur warrants were issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The\nwarrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder for the purpose of (i) curing any ambiguity or correcting\nany mistake, including to conform the provisions of the warrant agreement to the description of the terms of the warrants and the warrant agreement set forth in the\nprospectus for our IPO, or defective provision (ii) amending the provisions relating to cash dividends on ordinary shares as contemplated by and in accordance with\nthe warrant agreement or (iii) adding or changing any provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the warrant agreement as the parties to the warrant\nagreement may deem necessary or desirable and that the parties deem to not adversely affect the rights of the registered holders of the warrants, provided that the\napproval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants is required to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered\nholders of public warrants. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50% of the then\noutstanding public warrants approve of such amendment and, solely with respect to any amendment to the terms of the private placement warrants or any provision\nof the warrant agreement with respect to the private placement warrants, at least 50% of the number of the then outstanding private placement warrants. Although our\nability to amend the terms of the public warrants with the consent of the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants is unlimited, examples of such\namendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, convert the warrants into cash, shorten the exercise period or\ndecrease the number of Class A ordinary shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant.\nOur warrant agreement designates the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the sole and\nexclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders to\nobtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company.\nOur warrant agreement provides that, subject to applicable law, (i) any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the\nwarrant agreement, including under the Securities Act, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of New York, and (ii) that we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding\nor claim. We will waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courts represent an inconvenient forum.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions of the warrant agreement will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the\nExchange Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity\npurchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our warrants shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our warrant\nagreement. If any action, the subject matter of which is within the scope the forum provisions of the warrant agreement, is filed in a court other than a court of the\nState of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (a “foreign action”) in the name of any holder of our warrants, such holder\nshall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of New York in connection with any action\nbrought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an “enforcement action”), and (y) having service of process made upon such warrant holder in any such\nenforcement action by service upon such warrant holder’s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such warrant holder.\nThis choice-of-forum provision may limit a warrant holder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with our company,\nwhich may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our warrant agreement inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or\nmore of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and\nboard of directors.\n41\nTable of Contents\nWe may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem the outstanding public warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per\nwarrant, provided that the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares\nissuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to proper notice\nof such redemption and provided that certain other conditions are met. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even\nif we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem the warrants as set forth\nabove even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise the warrants. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you to (i) exercise your warrants and pay\nthe exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise\nwish to hold your warrants or (iii) accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, we expect would be\nsubstantially less than the market value of your warrants. None of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by our sponsor,\nApollo or their permitted transferees.\nIn addition, we have the ability to redeem the outstanding public warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of\n$0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption provided that the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds\n$10.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant) for any 20 trading days within a 30\ntrading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to proper notice of such redemption and provided that certain other conditions are met, including that holders\nwill be able to exercise their warrants prior to redemption for a number of Class A ordinary shares determined based on the redemption date and the fair market value of\nour Class A ordinary shares. The value received upon exercise of the warrants (1) may be less than the value the holders would have received if they had exercised\ntheir warrants at a later time where the underlying share price is higher and (2) may not compensate the holders for the value of the warrants, including because the\nnumber of ordinary shares received is capped at 0.361 Class A ordinary shares per warrant (subject to adjustment) irrespective of the remaining life of the warrants.\nNone of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by our sponsor, Apollo or their permitted transferees.\nNone of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us on such terms so long as they are held by their initial purchasers or their permitted\ntransferees.\nOur warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares and make it more difficult to effectuate our initial business\ncombination.\nWe have issued warrants to purchase 9,487,500 Class A ordinary shares as part of the Units offered in our IPO and an aggregate of 9,225,000 private\nplacement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. In addition, if the sponsor makes any working\ncapital loans, it may convert up to $1,500,000 of such loans into up to an additional 1,500,000 warrants, at the price of $1.00 per warrant. We may also issue Class A\nordinary shares in connection with our redemption of warrants. To the extent we issue ordinary shares for any reason, including to effectuate a business combination,\nthe potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional Class A ordinary shares upon exercise of these warrants could make us a less attractive acquisition\nvehicle to a target business. Such warrants, when exercised, will increase the number of outstanding Class A ordinary shares and reduce the value of the Class A\nordinary shares issued to complete the business transaction. Therefore, our warrants may make it more difficult to effectuate a business transaction or increase the\ncost of acquiring the target business.\n42\nTable of Contents\nBecause each unit contains one-half of one warrant and only a whole warrant may be exercised, the Units may be worth less than Units of other special purpose\nacquisition companies.\nEach Unit contains one-half of one warrant. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, no fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units, and only\nwhole Units will trade. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the\nnearest whole number the number of Class A ordinary shares to be issued to the warrant holder. This is different from other offerings similar to ours whose Units\ninclude one ordinary share and one whole warrant to purchase one whole share. We have established the components of the Units in this way in order to reduce the\ndilutive effect of the warrants upon completion of a business combination since the warrants will be exercisable in the aggregate for one-half of the number of shares\ncompared to Units that each contain a whole warrant to purchase one whole share, thus making us, we believe, a more attractive merger partner for target businesses.\nNevertheless, this unit structure may cause our units to be worth less than if a unit included a warrant to purchase one whole share.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions\nfrom disclosure requirements available to “emerging growth companies” or “smaller reporting companies,” this could make our securities less attractive to\ninvestors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\nWe are an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain\nexemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to,\nnot being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive\ncompensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation\nand shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information they\nmay deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the\nmarket value of our Class A ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30th before that time, in which case we would no longer be an\nemerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these\nexemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than\nthey otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting\nstandards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities\nregistered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect\nto opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is\nirrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application\ndates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or\nrevised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging\ngrowth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards\nused.\nAdditionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain\nreduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company\nuntil the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s\nsecond fiscal quarter, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year or the market value of our ordinary shares held\nby non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure\nobligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.\n43\nTable of Contents\nPast performance of our founders and the other members of our management team, including investments and transactions in which they have participated and\nbusinesses with which they have been associated, may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us, and we may be unable to provide positive\nreturns to shareholders.\nInformation regarding our founders and the other members of our management team, including investments and transactions in which they have participated\nand businesses with which they have been associated, is presented for informational purposes only. Any past experience and performance of our founders and the\nother members of our management team and the businesses with which they have been associated, including related to acquisitions and shareholder returns, is not a\nguarantee that we will be able to successfully identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination, that we will be able to provide positive returns to our\nshareholders, or of any results with respect to any initial business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical experiences of our founders\nor the other members of our management team, including investments and transactions in which they have participated and businesses with which they have been\nassociated, as indicative of the future performance of an investment in us, including whether we can provide an attractive return to our shareholders, or as indicative\nof every prior investment by each of our founders and the other members of our management team. The market price of our securities may be influenced by numerous\nfactors, many of which are beyond our control, and our shareholders may experience losses on their investment in our securities.\nWe are dependent upon our executive officers and directors and their loss could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nOur operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals and, in particular, our executive officers and directors. We believe that our success\ndepends on the continued service of our officers and directors, at least until we have completed our initial business combination. In addition, our executive officers\nand directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating their time among\nvarious business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. We do not have an employment\nagreement with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our directors or executive officers. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or\nexecutive officers could have a detrimental effect on us.\nOur executive officers, directors, security holders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests.\nWe have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, executive officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary\nor financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. In fact, we may enter into a\nbusiness combination with a target business that is affiliated with our sponsor, our directors or executive officers, although we do not intend to do so. Nor do we have\na policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such\npersons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours.\nThe personal and financial interests of our directors and officers may influence their motivation in timely identifying and selecting a target business and\ncompleting a business combination. Consequently, our directors’ and officers’ discretion in identifying and selecting a suitable target business may result in a conflict\nof interest when determining whether the terms, conditions and timing of a particular business combination are appropriate and in our shareholders’ best interest. If\nthis were the case, it would be a breach of their fiduciary duties to us as a matter of Cayman Islands law and we or our shareholders might have a claim against such\nindividuals for infringing on our shareholders’ rights. However, we might not ultimately be successful in any claim we may make against them for such reason.\n44\nTable of Contents\nCompliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may make it more difficult for us to effectuate a business combination, require substantial financial and\nmanagement resources, and increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-\nK for the year ending December 31, 2022. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer qualify as an emerging\ngrowth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial\nreporting. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared\nto other public companies because a target business with which we seek to complete our initial business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.\nBecause we are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, you may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights\nthrough the U.S. federal courts may be limited.\nWe are an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process\nwithin the United States upon our directors or executive officers, or enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against our directors or officers.\nOur corporate affairs are governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the Companies Act (as the same may be\nsupplemented or amended from time to time) and the common law of the Cayman Islands. We will also be subject to the federal securities laws of the United States.\nThe rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman\nIslands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively\nlimited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority, but are not binding on\na court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are different from what they\nwould be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as\ncompared to the United States, and certain states, such as Delaware, may have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law. In addition,\nCayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholders derivative action in a federal court of the United States.\nWe have been advised by Maples and Calder (Cayman) LLP, our Cayman Islands legal counsel, that the courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (i) to\nrecognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United\nStates or any state; and (ii) in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal\nsecurities laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there is no\nstatutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money\njudgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon\nthe judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the\nCayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a\nCayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of which is,\ncontrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy). A\nCayman Islands Court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.\nAs a result of all of the above, public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management, members\nof the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a U.S. company.\n45\nTable of Contents\nProvisions in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be\nwilling to pay in the future for our Class A ordinary shares and could entrench management.\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that shareholders\nmay consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include a staggered board of directors, advance notice procedures, inability of shareholders to call a\ngeneral meeting, removal of directors only for cause (other than by holders of our Class B ordinary shares prior to our initial business combination) and only by the\nboard of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preference shares, and the fact that prior to the completion\nof our initial business combination only holders of our Class B ordinary shares are entitled to vote on the appointment of directors, which may make more difficult the\nremoval of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nCyber incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nWe depend on digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, including those of third parties with\nwhich we may deal. Sophisticated and deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in, our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure of third parties or\nthe cloud, could lead to corruption or misappropriation of our assets, proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. As an early stage company without\nsignificant investments in data security protection, we may not be sufficiently protected against such occurrences. We may not have sufficient resources to\nadequately protect against, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to, cyber incidents. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them,\ncould have adverse consequences on our business and lead to financial loss.\nSince only holders of our founder shares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors, upon the listing of our shares on Nasdaq, Nasdaq may\nconsider us to be a “controlled company” within the meaning of Nasdaq rules and, as a result, we may qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance\nrequirements.\nPrior to consummation of our initial business combination, only holders of our founder shares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors. As\na result, Nasdaq may consider us to be a “controlled company” within the meaning of Nasdaq corporate governance standards. Under Nasdaq corporate governance\nstandards, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to\ncomply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that:\n• we have a board that includes a majority of “independent directors,” as defined under Nasdaq rules;\n• we have a compensation committee of our board that is comprised entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s\npurpose and responsibilities; and\n• we have independent director oversight of our director nominations.\nWe do not intend to utilize these exemptions and intend to comply with the corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq, subject to applicable phase-in\nrules. However, if we determine in the future to utilize some or all of these exemptions, you will not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies\nthat are subject to all of Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.\nIf our management following our initial business combination is unfamiliar with United States securities laws, they may have to expend time and resources\nbecoming familiar with such laws, which could lead to various regulatory issues.\nFollowing our initial business combination, our management may resign from their positions as officers or directors of the company and the management of\nthe target business at the time of the business combination will remain in place. Management of the target business may not be familiar with U.S. securities laws. If\nnew management is unfamiliar with U.S. securities laws, they may have to expend time and resources becoming familiar with such laws. This could be expensive and\ntime-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues which may adversely affect our operations.\n46\nTable of Contents\nAfter our initial business combination, substantially all of our assets may be located in a foreign country and substantially all of our revenue may be derived\nfrom our operations in any such country. Accordingly, our results of operations and prospects will be subject, to a significant extent, to the economic, political\nand social conditions and government policies, developments and conditions in the country in which we operate.\nThe economic, political and social conditions, as well as government policies, of the country in which our operations are located could affect our business.\nEconomic growth could be uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy and such growth may not be sustained in the future. If in the\nfuture such country’s economy experiences a downturn or grows at a slower rate than expected, there may be less demand for spending in certain industries. A\ndecrease in demand for spending in certain industries could materially and adversely affect our ability to find an attractive target business with which to consummate\nour initial business combination and if we effect our initial business combination, the ability of that target business to become profitable.\nExchange rate fluctuations and currency policies may cause a target business’ ability to succeed in the international markets to be diminished.\nIn the event we acquire a non-U.S. target, all revenues and income would likely be received in a foreign currency, and the dollar equivalent of our net assets\nand distributions, if any, could be adversely affected by reductions in the value of the local currency. The value of the currencies in our target regions fluctuate and\nare affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions. Any change in the relative value of such currency against our reporting currency\nmay affect the attractiveness of any target business or, following consummation of our initial business combination, our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, if a currency appreciates in value against the dollar prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, the cost of a target business as\nmeasured in dollars will increase, which may make it less likely that we are able to consummate such transaction.\nWe may reincorporate in another jurisdiction in connection with our initial business combination, and the laws of such jurisdiction may govern some or all of\nour future material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights.\nIn connection with our initial business combination, we may relocate the home jurisdiction of our business from the Cayman Islands to another jurisdiction. If\nwe determine to do this, the laws of such jurisdiction may govern some or all of our future material agreements. The system of laws and the enforcement of existing\nlaws in such jurisdiction may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the United States. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of\nour future agreements could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities or capital.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone.\nItem 2. Properties.\nWe do not own or lease any real estate or other physical properties materially important to our operation. We currently maintain our executive offices at 2\nWisconsin Circle, 7th Floor, Chevy Chase, MD 20815. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.\nItem 3.

Our units commenced public trading on December 3, 2021, and our Class A ordinary shares and warrants commenced separate public trading on January\n24, 2022.\nHolders\nOn March 30, 2023, there was 1 holder of record of our units, 1 holder of record of our Class A ordinary shares, 3 holders of record of our warrants, and 13\nholders of record of our founder shares.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans\nNone.\nDividends\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of our initial business\ncombination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial\ncondition subsequent to completion of our initial business combination and subject to the company having funds lawfully available for distribution under Cayman\nIslands law. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to our initial business combination is within the discretion of our board of directors at such time and\nsubject to the company having funds lawfully available for distribution under Cayman Islands law. If we incur any indebtedness in connection with a business\ncombination, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nOn April 7, 2021, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 4,312,500 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.006 per\nshare. On December 2, 2021, we effected an ordinary share dividend resulting in our sponsor holding an aggregate of 4,503,750 founder shares. The sale of the founder\nshares was made pursuant to an exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.\nOn December 7, 2021, we consummated the Private Placement, with our sponsor and Apollo, of an aggregate of 8,235,000 private placement warrants at a\nprice of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds to us of $8,235,000. On December 7, 2021, a total of $168,300,000 of the net proceeds from the\nIPO and the Private Placement were deposited in the Trust Account. On December 9, 2021, the Underwriter purchased an additional 2,475,000 Units pursuant to the\nover-allotment option. On December 9, 2021 we consummated the Additional Private Placement with our sponsor and the Underwriter of an aggregate of an additional\n990,000 private placement warrants at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrants, generating gross proceeds to us of $990,000. On December 9, 2021, a total of\n$25,245,000 of the proceeds from the closing of the Over-Allotment Option Units and the Additional Private Placement were deposited into the Trust Account. The\nprivate placement warrants are identical to the warrants sold as part of the units in the IPO except that, so long as they are held by our sponsor, Apollo or their\npermitted transferees: (1) they will not be redeemable by us, except as otherwise set forth in the terms thereof; (2) they (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable\nupon exercise of these warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the initial purchasers, until 30 days after the\ncompletion of our initial business combination; (3) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis; and (4) the holders thereof (including with respect to the\nordinary shares issuable upon exercise of these warrants) are entitled to registration rights. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such\nsale. The sale of the private placement warrants was made pursuant to an exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.\n48\nTable of Contents\nUse of Proceeds from the Initial Public Offering\nOn December 7, 2021, we consummated our IPO of 16,500,000 Units. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, and the IPO generated gross proceeds\nof $165,500,000. Needham & Company, LLC. acted as the sale book-running manager of the IPO. The securities sold in the IPO were registered under the Securities Act\non a registration statement on Form S-1 (Nos. 333-260889 and 333-261473). The SEC declared the registration statement effective on December 2, 2021. On December 7,\n2021, the Underwriter exercised in full the option granted to them by the Company to purchase up to 2,475,000 additional Units solely to cover over-allotments, which\noption was granted to them under the underwriting agreement for the IPO. The sale of these 2,475,000 additional Units closed on December 9, 2021, generating gross\nproceeds of $24,750,000.\nWe paid a total of $10,436,250 in underwriting fees related to the IPO, of which, the underwriter agreed to defer $6,641,250 until such time as our initial\nbusiness combination is completed, if at all.\nOn December 7, 2021, a total of $168,300,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placements were deposited in the Trust Account. On December\n9, 2021, a total of $25,245,000 of the proceeds from the closing of the Over-Allotment Option Units and the Additional Private Placement were deposited into the Trust\nAccount, resulting in a total deposit of $193,545,000 in the Trust Account since the Trust Account was established. The net proceeds deposited into the Trust\nAccount remain on deposit in the Trust Account and are available for a business combination, assuming no redemptions, after payment of up to $6,641,250 of deferred\nunderwriting fees, before fees and expenses associated with our initial business combination. The proceeds held in the Trust Account will be invested only in U.S.\ngovernment securities with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act\nwhich invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nNone.\nItem 6. Reserved.\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nWe are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition,\nshare purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. We have not identified any potential business combination\ntarget and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any potential business combination target. We\nintend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the IPO and the Private Placements, our capital stock, debt or a combination of\ncash, stock and debt.\nOn December 7, 2021, we completed our IPO of 16,500,000 Units and the Private Placement of an aggregate of 8,235,000 private placement warrants. On\nDecember 7, 2021, the Underwriter exercised in full the option granted to them by the Company to purchase up to 2,475,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments,\nand we issued an additional 990,000 private placement warrants in the Additional Private Placement. An aggregate of $193,545,000 in proceeds from the IPO and the\nPrivate Placements has been placed in the Trust Account.\n49\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had cash of approximately $627,628 and $1,050,670 and working capital of approximately $176,944 and\n$1,184,733, respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or\nto complete our initial business combination will be successful.\nResults of Operations\nOur only activities from inception through December 31, 2022 were those related to our formation, the preparation for our Initial Public Offering and,\nsince the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the search for a prospective initial Business Combination. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated\nany operating revenues to date. We will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial Business Combination, at the earliest. We incurred\nexpenses as a result of being a public company (including for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for expenses in connection\nwith searching for a prospective initial Business Combination.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, had net income of $12,658,706 which consists of operating expenses of $1,243,831, $11,226,187 of change in fair\nvalue of the warrant liability, $854,167 of interest earned on marketable securities and $1,822,183 of unrealized gain on marketable securities.\nFor the period from March 26, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, we had a net income of $1,742,973, which consists of operating expenses\n$214,079, interest earned on marketable securities of $4,933, change in fair value of warrant liability of $2,432,625 and $480,506 of transaction costs allocated to the\nwarrant liability.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOn December 7, 2021, we completed our IPO of 16,500,000 Units and the Private Placement of an aggregate of 8,235,000 private placement warrants,\ngenerating gross proceeds of $173,235,000.\nOn December 9, 2021, the Underwriter exercised in full the option granted to them by the Company to purchase up to 2,475,000 additional Units to cover over-\nallotments, and we issued an additional 990,000 private placement warrants in the Additional Private Placement, generating total gross proceeds of $25,245,000.\nFollowing our IPO, the exercise of the over-allotment option and the sale of the private placement warrants, a total of $193,545,000 was placed in the Trust\nAccounts. We incurred $12,517,335 in transaction costs, including $3,795,000 in cash underwriting fees, $6,641,250 of deferred underwriting fees, $1,248,100 of offering\ncosts related to the fair value of the Founder Shares sold to Anchor Investor, and $832,985 of other offering costs.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, cash used in operating activities was $411,937. Net income of $12,658,706 was impacted by interest earned\non marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $854,167, change in fair value of warrant liability of $11,226,187, unrealized gain on marketable securities held in\nthe Trust Account of $1,822,183 and changes in operating assets and liabilities which used $831,893 from operating activities.\nFor the period from March 26, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, cash used in operating activities was $595,288. Net loss of $1,742,973 was\nimpacted by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Accounts of $4,933, change in fair value of warrant liability of $2,432,625, transaction costs\nallocable to warrants of $480,506, and changes in operating assets and liabilities, which used $381,209 of cash from operating activities.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had investments of $196,226,283 and $193,549,933 held in the Trust Accounts, respectively. We intend to\nuse substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Accounts, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Accounts (less taxes paid and deferred\nunderwriting commissions) to complete our initial Business Combination. We may withdraw interest to pay taxes. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022\nand the period ended December 31, 2021, we did not withdraw any interest earned on the Trust Accounts. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole\nor in part, as consideration to complete our initial Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Accounts will be used as working capital to finance\nthe operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.\n50\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had cash of $627,628 and $1,050,670 outside of the Trust Accounts. We intend to use the funds held\noutside the Trust Accounts primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from\nthe offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of\nprospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete our initial Business Combination.\nIn addition, in order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our\nsponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial\nbusiness combination, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. Otherwise, such loans may be repaid only out of\nfunds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the\nTrust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans\nmay be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination company at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender.\nBased on the foregoing, management believes that the Company will have sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity from the Sponsor or an affiliate\nof the Sponsor, or certain of the Company’s officers and directors to meet its needs through the earlier of the consummation of a Business Combination or one year\nfrom this filing. Over this time period, the Company will be using these funds for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial\nBusiness Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge\nwith or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination.\nIn connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with the authoritative guidance in FASB ASU 2014-15,\n“Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.” The Company has until June 6, 2023, 18 months from the closing of the IPO,\nto consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by the specified period. If a Business\nCombination is not consummated by June 6, 2023 and the Company decides not to extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination, there will be a\nmandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution.\nThe Company’s evaluation of its liquidity condition and the date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the\nCompany’s ability to continue as a going concern one year from the date that these financial statements are issued. These financial statements do not include any\nadjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as\na going concern.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements; Commitments and Contractual Obligations\nOn December 31, 2022, we did not have any obligations, assets or liabilities that would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item\n303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations.\nContractual Obligations\nAdministrative Support Agreement\nOn December 2, 2021, the Company entered into an Administrative Support Agreement pursuant to which the Company may reimburse an affiliate of the\nSponsor up to an amount of $10,000 per month for office space and secretarial and administrative support. The Company considered this agreement under the\nguidance of ASC 842, Leases, and determined that this agreement did not meet the definitions of a lease.\n51\nTable of Contents\nRegistration Rights\nThe holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and any warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans (and in\neach case holders of their component securities, as applicable) are entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement effective December 2, 2021,\nwhich requires the Company to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to our Class A ordinary shares). The\nholders of the majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In\naddition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the consummation of a Business\nCombination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Company will bear the\nexpenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\nUnderwriter’s Agreement\nThe Company paid a cash underwriting discount of 2.00% of the gross proceeds of the IPO, or $3,795,000 due to the exercise of the over-allotment option in\nfull. In addition, the underwriter will be entitled to a deferred fee of three and a half percent (3.50%) of the gross proceeds of the IPO, or $6,641,250. The deferred fee\nwill become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject\nto the terms of the underwriting agreement. The underwriter has reimbursed the Company for $550,000 for offering expenses. The reimbursement of these costs has\nbeen accounted for as a reduction to offering costs of the IPO.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThis management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been\nprepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of\nassets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our\nestimates and judgments, including those related to fair value of financial instruments and accrued expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience, known\ntrends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about\nthe carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions\nor conditions. The Company has identified the following as its critical accounting policies:\nWarrant Liabilities\nThe Company accounts for the Warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the specific terms of the\nWarrants and the applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480,\n“Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity” (“ASC 480”), and ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether they are freestanding\nfinancial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC\n815, including whether the Warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common shares and whether the holders of the Warrants could potentially require “net cash\nsettlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of\nprofessional judgment, is conducted at the time of issuance of the Warrants and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the Warrants are outstanding.\nFor issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, such warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in\ncapital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, such warrants are required to be recorded at\ntheir initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of liability-classified warrants are recognized\nas a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations.\n52\nTable of Contents\nClass A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption\nClass A ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. Conditionally\nredeemable Class A ordinary shares (including Class A ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to\nredemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Class A ordinary\nshares is classified as shareholders’ equity. Our Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject\nto the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, 18,975,000 shares of Class A ordinary shares subject to\npossible redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders’ deficit section of the Company’s balance sheet.\nNet Income Per Ordinary Share\nBasic income per ordinary share is computed by dividing net income applicable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares\noutstanding during the period. Consistent with ASC 480, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption, as well as their pro rata share of undistributed trust earnings\nconsistent with the two-class method, have been excluded from the calculation of income per ordinary share for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2022 and\nthe period from March 26, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021. Such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of trust earnings. Diluted income per\nshare includes the incremental number of ordinary shares to be issued to settle warrants, as calculated using the treasury method. For the period from December 31,\n2021 to December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any dilutive warrants, securities or other contracts that could potentially, be exercised or converted into\nordinary shares. As a result, diluted income per ordinary share is the same as basic income per ordinary share for all periods presented.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and\nDerivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (“ASU 2020-06”) to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06\neliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative\nscope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity’s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for\nconvertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance,\nincluding the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. As a smaller reporting company, ASU 2020-06 is effective January 1, 2024 and\nshould be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021. The Company is currently assessing the\nimpact, if any, that ASU 2020-06 would have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect\non the Company’s financial statements.\nJOBS Act\nOn April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for\nqualifying public companies. Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial\naccounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of\nsecurities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company\ncan elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt\nout is irrevocable. We have elected to irrevocably opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has\ndifferent application dates for public or private companies, we will adopt the new or revised standard at the time public companies adopt the new or revised standard.\nThis may make comparison of our financial statements with another emerging growth company that has not opted out of using the extended transition period difficult\nor impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.\n53\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to\ncertain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an “emerging growth company”, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other\nthings, (i) provide an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the\ncompensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii)\ncomply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional\ninformation about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the\ncorrelation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO’s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will\napply for a period of five years following the completion of our IPO or until we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” whichever is earlier.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under\nthis item.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nReference is made to Pages F-1 through F-15 comprising a portion of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we carried out an\nevaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange\nAct. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report\non Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nDisclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to\nour management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nOur Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process\ndesigned by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other\npersonnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n• pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our\ncompany,\n54\nTable of Contents\n• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and\nthat our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and\n• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on the financial statements\nIn making these assessments, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that our internal control over financial\nreporting was effective.\nManagement has concluded that our audited financial statements included in this Report are fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with GAAP for\neach of the periods presented therein.\nThis Report does not include an attestation report of internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm due to our status as an\nemerging growth company under the JOBS Act.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during\nthe most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B. Other Information.\nNot applicable.\nItem 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections\nNot applicable.\nPART III\nItem 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.\nDirectors and Executive Officers\nOur directors and executive officers are as follows:\nName Age Title\nMarcus Brauchli 60 Chairman\nPaul Bascobert 57 Independent Director\nSean Glodek 50 Vice President and Director\nNorman Pearlstine 79 Independent Director\nJoel Motley 69 Independent Director\nMatt Goldberg 51 Independent Director\nPriscilla Han 38 Independent Director\nDale Mathias 70 Independent Director\n55\nTable of Contents\nMarcus Brauchli, Blue Ocean’s Chairman, has been co-founder and managing partner of North Base Media Ltd. since January 2014.

We believe Mr. Brauchli’s extensive experience leading media and global businesses, investing in digital and technology\ngrowth companies, and his substantial management experience brings important and valuable skills to our board of directors.\nRichard Leggett, serves as Blue Ocean’s Chief Executive Officer. He is an accomplished global chief executive in the information services, financial services\nand professional services industries with over 32 years of experience and an entrepreneurial track record in all aspects of growing and operating a global business.\nOver the last 16 years, Mr. Leggett has served as CEO of three PE-backed technology-enabled information services businesses guiding two of them through\nsuccessful exits to strategic buyers. From January 2012 through September 2022, Mr. Leggett served as the CEO of FrontierView, a global market intelligence company\nwhich he built and in November 2021 sold to FiscalNote (NYSE: NOTE) prior to FiscalNotes’s IPO in August 2022.

In addition, prior to the completion of an initial business combination, holders of a majority of our founder shares may remove a member of the\nboard of directors for any reason.\nOur officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of\ndirectors are authorized to appoint persons to the offices as set forth in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association as it deems appropriate.\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that our officers may consist of one or more chairmen of the board, chief executive\nofficers, a president, chief financial officer, vice presidents, secretary, treasurer and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors.\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nOur board of directors has two standing committees: an audit committee and a compensation committee. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception,\nNasdaq rules and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors, and Nasdaq\nrules require that the compensation committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. Each committee operates under a charter that was\napproved by our board of directors and has the composition and responsibilities described below.\nAudit Committee\nWe have established a separately-designated standing audit committee of the board of directors.

Each member of the audit committee is financially literate, and our board of directors has\ndetermined that Joel Motley qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” as defined in applicable SEC rules.

In accordance with Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq rules, a majority of the independent directors may recommend a director nominee for selection\nby the board of directors. The board of directors believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily carry out the responsibility of properly selecting or\napproving director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee. The directors who participate in the consideration and recommendation of\ndirector nominees are Norman Pearlstine, Joel Motley, Matt Goldberg, Priscilla Han and Dale Mathias. In accordance with Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq rules, all such\ndirectors are independent. As there is no standing nominating committee, we do not have a nominating committee charter in place.\nWe have not formally established any specific minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. In general, in\nidentifying and evaluating nominees for director, our board of directors considers educational background, diversity of professional experience, knowledge of our\nbusiness, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom and the ability to represent the best interests of our shareholders.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nNone of our executive officers currently serves, and in the past year has not served, as a member of the compensation committee of any entity that has one or\nmore executive officers serving on our board of directors.\nCode of Ethics\nWe have adopted a code of ethics and business conduct applicable to our directors, officers and employees.\nAvailability of Documents\nWe have filed a copy of our Code of Ethics, our audit committee charter and our compensation committee charter as exhibits to the registration statement\nrelating to our IPO and they are referred to in the exhibit index of this report.

Executive Compensation.\nExecutive Officer and Director Compensation\nNone of our executive officers or directors has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. In addition, our sponsor, executive officers and\ndirectors, or any of their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating, negotiating and completing an\ninitial business combination. In the future, we, upon consultation with the compensation committee of our board of directors, may decide to compensate our executive\nofficers and other employees. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or\nour or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial business combination will be made using funds held outside the Trust Account. Other than quarterly audit\ncommittee review of such reimbursements, we do not expect to have any additional controls in place governing our reimbursement payments to our directors and\nexecutive officers for their out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating, negotiating and completing an initial business combination. Other than these\npayments and reimbursements, no compensation of any kind, including finder’s and consulting fees, will be paid by the company to our sponsor, executive officers\nand directors, or any of their respective affiliates, prior to completion of our initial business combination.\nAfter the completion of our initial business combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting or\nmanagement fees from the combined company.

We have not established any limit on the amount of such\nfees that may be paid by the combined company to our directors or members of management. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time\nof the proposed business combination, because the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining executive officer and director\ncompensation. Any compensation to be paid to our executive officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a\ncompensation committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors.\nWe do not intend to take any action to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the consummation of our initial\nbusiness combination, although it is possible that some or all of our executive officers and directors may remain directors or negotiate employment or consulting\narrangements to remain with us after our initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements to retain their\npositions with us may influence our management’s motivation in identifying or selecting a target business but we do not believe that the ability of our management to\nremain with us after the consummation of our initial business combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business\ncombination. We are not party to any agreements with our executive officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment.\nItem 12.

If we do not complete our initial business combination before June 7, 2023 (or September 7, 2023, if the period of time to consummate a business\ncombination is extended), the private placement warrants will expire worthless. The private placement warrants are subject to the transfer restrictions described below.\nThe private placement warrants will not be redeemable by us so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. Our sponsor, Apollo or\ntheir permitted transferees, have the option to exercise the private placement warrants on a cashless basis. If the private placement warrants are held by holders other\nthan initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the\nwarrants included in the units sold in our IPO. Otherwise, the private placement warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants sold in\nour IPO.\nIn the event that our sponsor deems it necessary in order to facilitate our initial business combination for the sponsor to forfeit, transfer, exchange or amend\nthe terms of all or any portion of the private placement warrants or to enter into any other arrangements with respect to the private placement warrants (including,\nwithout limitation, a transfer of the sponsor’s membership interests representing an interest in the private placement warrants) to facilitate the consummation of such\nbusiness combination, such change shall apply pro rata to Apollo and our sponsor based on the relative number of private placement warrants held by each. By way\nof example, in the event 50% of the sponsor’s private placement warrants are forfeited or transferred by the sponsor as part of such business combination, Apollo\nshall forfeit or transfer 50% of its private placement warrants on substantially the same terms and conditions as the sponsor, in which case the reduction shall equal\n50% of the private placement warrants held by Apollo at such time.\nOur sponsor, and our officers and directors are deemed to be our “promoters” as such term is defined under the federal securities laws.\nTransfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants\nThe founder shares, private placement warrants and any Class A ordinary shares issued upon conversion or exercise thereof are each subject to transfer\nrestrictions pursuant to lock-up provisions in the letter agreement entered into by our initial shareholders, directors, officers and Apollo. Pursuant to such letter\nagreement, our initial shareholders, directors, officers and Apollo have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell (i) any of their founder shares until the earlier to occur of:\n(a) one year after the completion of our initial business combination; and (b) subsequent to our initial business combination (x) the date on which we complete a\nliquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for\ncash, securities or other property or (y) if the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions,\nshare capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and other similar transactions) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least\n150 days after our initial business combination and (ii) any of their private placement warrants and the respective Class A ordinary shares underlying such warrants\nuntil 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. The foregoing restrictions are not applicable to transfers (a) to our officers or directors, any\naffiliates or family members of any of our officers or directors, any members of our sponsor or their affiliates, or any affiliates of our sponsor or of Apollo, (b) in the\ncase of an individual, by gift to a member of one of the individual’s immediate family or to a trust, the beneficiary of that is a member of the individual’s immediate\nfamily, an affiliate of such person or to a charitable organization, (c) in the case of an individual, by virtue of laws of descent and distribution upon death of the\nindividual, (d) in the case of an individual, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, (e) by private sales or transfers made in connection with any forward\npurchase agreement or similar arrangement or in connection with the consummation of a business combination at prices no greater than the price at which the\napplicable securities were originally purchased, (f) by virtue of the laws of the Cayman Islands or the limited liability company agreement of our sponsor upon\ndissolution of the sponsor, (g) in the event of the company’s liquidation prior to the completion of a business combination, (h) to the company for no value for\ncancellation in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, or (i) in the event of our completion of a liquidation, merger, share exchange or\nother similar transaction which results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property\nsubsequent to our completion of our initial business combination; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (a) through (f) these permitted transferees must enter\ninto a written agreement agreeing to be bound by these transfer restrictions and the other restrictions contained in the letter agreements.\n64\nTable of Contents\nRegistration Rights\nThe holders of the founder shares, private placement warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans (and any Class A\nordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the private placement warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans) will be\nentitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands,\nthat we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our\ncompletion of our initial business combination. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\nItem 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\nOn April 7, 2021, we issued to our sponsor an aggregate of 4,312,500 founder shares in exchange for a payment of $25,000 from our sponsor to cover certain\nexpenses on behalf of us, or approximately $0.006 per share. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by the sponsor, the company had no assets,\ntangible or intangible. The per share price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash the sponsor paid for the founder shares by the\nnumber of founder shares issued. Our sponsor transferred 30,000 founder shares to each of Joel Motley, Matt Goldberg, and Priscilla Han, and 25,000 founder shares\nto each of Norman Pearlstine and Dale Mathias, our independent directors, at the same price originally paid for such shares. In addition, our sponsor transferred an\naggregate of 100,000 founder shares to six advisors at the same price as originally paid for such shares. Our sponsor also surrendered 618,750 founder shares to us for\nno consideration due to the underwriter’s exercise of the over-allotment option. The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares\nconcurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder thereof, on a one-for-one basis,\nsubject to adjustment. On December 2, 2021, we effected an ordinary share dividend resulting in our sponsor receiving an additional 191,250 founders shares, in order\nto maintain the number of founder shares, on an as-converted basis, at 20% of the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares outstanding at\nsuch time.\nOur sponsor and Apollo purchased an aggregate of 9,225,000 private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one ordinary share at $11.50 per share,\nsubject to adjustment, at a price of $1.00 per warrant ($9,2250,000 in the aggregate), in a private placement that closed substantially concurrent with our IPO. Our\nsponsor purchased 9,125,000 private placement warrants and Apollo purchased 100,000 private placement warrants. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder\nto purchase one ordinary share at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The private placement warrants (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon\nexercise of the private placement warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold until 30 days after the completion of our\ninitial business combination. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent\nof our sponsor.\nIn the event that our sponsor deems it necessary in order to facilitate our initial business combination for the sponsor to forfeit, transfer, exchange or amend\nthe terms of all or any portion of the private placement warrants or to enter into any other arrangements with respect to the private placement warrants (including,\nwithout limitation, a transfer of the sponsor’s membership interests representing an interest in the private placement warrants) to facilitate the consummation of such\nbusiness combination, such change shall apply pro rata to Apollo and our sponsor based on the relative number of private placement warrants held by each. By way\nof example, in the event 50% of the sponsor’s private placement warrants are forfeited or transferred by the sponsor as part of such business combination, Apollo\nshall forfeit or transfer 50% of its private placement warrants on substantially the same terms and conditions as the sponsor, in which case the reduction shall equal\n50% of the private placement warrants held by Apollo at such time.\n65\nTable of Contents\nIf any of our founders, officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he, she or it has\nthen-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, then, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, he, she or it will need to honor such fiduciary or\ncontractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity.\nOther than these fees, no compensation of any kind, including finder’s and consulting fees, will be paid by the company to our sponsor, executive officers\nand directors, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the completion of an initial business combination. However,\nthese individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating, negotiating and completing an initial business combination.\nOur audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates.\nWe agreed to pay an affiliate of our sponsor $10,000 per month for office space, administrative and support services, and are accruing that obligation.\nIn order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an\naffiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required on a non-interest basis. If we complete\nour initial business combination, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds held in the Trust Account released to us. In the event that the initial\nbusiness combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds\nfrom our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity\nat a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise price,\nexercisability and exercise period. Except as set forth above, the terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to\nsuch loans. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our\nsponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our Trust\nAccount.\nAfter our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the\ncombined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our shareholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as\napplicable, furnished to our shareholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of distribution of such tender offer materials or at\nthe time of a general meeting held to consider our initial business combination, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to\ndetermine executive and director compensation.\nAt the closing of our initial business combination, we will issue and sell an additional 125,000 founder shares to Apollo subject to a reduction in ownership\n(as described below). The purchase price for the founder shares in each case will be $0.0058 per share and our sponsor will automatically forfeit to the company for\ncancellation, for $0.0058 per share, a number of founder shares equal to the number of founder shares purchased by Apollo. However, if Apollo does not enter into a\nbinding commitment to purchase an amount of Class A ordinary shares with a value of at least $25,000,000 (or equivalent securities of the target of the business\ncombination or the successor registrant of the Company) in a private placement financing that will close concurrently with the closing of the initial business\ncombination, the number of founder shares that Apollo will be entitled to purchase at the closing of our initial business combination will be reduced up to 125,000\nfounder shares on a pro rata basis. Additionally, if immediately following the closing of the initial business combination, (i) Apollo owns less than 100% but more than\n50% of the 9.99% of the Class A ordinary shares sold in our IPO, then Apollo will forfeit its right to purchase up to 50,000 founder shares on a pro rata basis, or (ii)\nApollo owns less than 50% of the 9.99% of the Class A ordinary shares sold in our IPO, then Apollo will forfeit its right to purchase up to 75,000 founder shares in\naddition to the forfeiture of 50,000 founder shares pursuant to (i) on a pro rata basis. In the event our sponsor deems it necessary in order to facilitate an initial\nbusiness combination for the sponsor to forfeit, transfer, exchange or amend the terms of all or any portion of the founder shares or to enter into any other\narrangements with respect to the founder shares (including, without limitation, a transfer of the sponsor’s membership interests representing an interest in any of the\nforegoing), such change in investment will apply pro rata to Apollo and our sponsor based on the relative number of founder shares to be held by each, and,\naccordingly, Apollo will forfeit its right to purchase up to 125,000 founder shares as necessary to facilitate the foregoing. In the event that a reduction of ownership in\nApollo’s founder shares exceeds the 125,000 additional founder shares eligible for purchase by Apollo, effective on the closing of an initial business combination,\nApollo will forfeit to us, for reissuance to our sponsor, an amount of its additional founder shares previously purchased equal to such excess, provided that Apollo\nwill not be required to forfeit more than 125,000 of the additional founder shares purchased (such that Apollo will in all circumstances be allowed to retain at least\n50,000 founder shares).\n66\nTable of Contents\nWe have agreed to reissue to our sponsor, at a price of $0.0058 per share, a number of founder shares equal to any founder shares or rights to purchase\nfounder shares forfeited by Apollo.\nIn the event that Apollo votes its public shares in favor of our initial business combination, a smaller portion of affirmative votes from other public\nshareholders would be required to approve our initial business combination. However, because Apollo is not obligated to continue owning any public shares, we\ncannot assure you that Apollo will be a shareholder at the time of our initial business combination.\nIn addition, the units (including the underlying public shares and warrants) Apollo may purchase will not be subject to any agreements restricting their\ntransfer.\nRefer to Note 4 of our financial statements for more information regarding our related party transactions.\nPolicy for Approval of Related Party Transactions\nThe audit committee of our board of directors will adopt a charter, providing for the review, approval and/or ratification of “related party transactions,” which\nare those transactions required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K as promulgated by the SEC, by the audit committee. At its meetings, the audit\ncommittee shall be provided with the details of each new, existing, or proposed related party transaction, including the terms of the transaction, any contractual\nrestrictions that the company has already committed to, the business purpose of the transaction, and the benefits of the transaction to the company and to the\nrelevant related party. Any member of the committee who has an interest in the related party transaction under review by the committee shall abstain from voting on\nthe approval of the related party transaction, but may, if so requested by the chairman of the committee, participate in some or all of the committee’s discussions of the\nrelated party transaction. Upon completion of its review of the related party transaction, the committee may determine to permit or to prohibit the related party\ntransaction.\nManagement will present to the audit committee each proposed related party transaction, including all relevant facts and circumstances relating thereto.\nUnder the policy, we may consummate related party transactions only if our audit committee approves or ratifies the transaction in accordance with the guidelines set\nforth in the policy. The policy will not permit any director or executive officer to participate in the discussion of, or decision concerning, a related person transaction in\nwhich he or she is the related party.\nDirector Independence\nNasdaq listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors be independent. An “independent director” is defined generally as a person other\nthan an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the company’s board of directors,\nwould interfere with the director’s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our board of directors has determined that\nNorman Pearlstine, Joel Motley, Matt Goldberg, Priscilla Han, and Dale Mathias are “independent directors” as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable\nSEC rules. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.\n67\nTable of Contents\nItem 14.

(the “Company”) for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related\nstatements of operations, changes in shareholders’ deficit, cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from March 26, 2021 (inception)\nthrough December 31, 2021 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the financial position of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the result of their operations and their cash flows for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from March 26, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America.\nExplanatory Paragraph – Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in\nNote 1, if the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination, then the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. In addition,\nthe Company has incurred negative cash used in operating activities and needs to raise additional funds to meet its obligations and sustain its operations. These\nconditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in\nNote 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to\nbe independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we\nengaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we\nexpress no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks.

DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS\nBlue Ocean Acquisition Corp (the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on March 26, 2021. The Company was formed\nfor the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or\nmore businesses (the “Business Combination”). The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks\nassociated with early stage and emerging growth companies.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had not yet commenced any operations. All activity for the period March 26, 2021 (inception), through December 31,\n2022, relates to the Company’s formation and the initial public offering (the “Public Offering”) which is described below. The Company will not generate any operating\nrevenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income\nfrom the proceeds derived from the Public Offering. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end.\nThe registration statement for the Company’s Public Offering was declared effective on December 6, 2021 (the “Effective Date”). On December 7, 2021, the\nCompany consummated the Public Offering of 16,500,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the shares of Class A ordinary shares included in the Units being\noffered, the “Public Shares”), generating gross proceeds of $165,000,000 which is described in Note 3. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the\nCompany (the “Public Shares”) and one-half of one redeemable warrant (the “Public Warrants”). On December 9, 2021, the underwriters fully exercised the over-\nallotment option and purchased 2,475,000 units (the “Over-Allotment Option Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Over-Allotment Option Unit, generating gross proceeds of\n$24,750,000.\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 8,235,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a\nprice of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant that closed in a private placement to Blue Ocean Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”) and Apollo SPAC Fund I, L.P. (“Apollo” or\n“Anchor Investor”) simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering (see Note 4). On December 9, 2021, the Company consummated the sale of additional\n990,000 Private Placement Warrants (the “Additional Private Placement Warrants”) with the Sponsor at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total\nproceeds of $990,000.\nTransaction costs amounted to $12,517,335, consisting of $3,795,000 in cash underwriting fees, $6,641,250 of deferred underwriting fees, $1,248,100 of offering\ncosts related to the fair value of the Founder Shares sold to Anchor Investor, and $832,985 of other offering costs.\nFollowing the closing of the Public Offering, the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, the sale of the Over-Allotment Option Units and the sale of the\nAdditional Private Placement Shares, an amount of $193,545,000 ($10.20 per Public Unit) was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”), located in the United\nStates and will be invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended\n(the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected\nby the Company meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a\nBusiness Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds held in the Trust Account, as described below.\nThe Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Public Offering and the sale of the\nPrivate Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination.\nNASDAQ rules provide that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the\nbalance in the Trust Account (as defined below) (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time\nof the signing a definitive agreement to enter a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination\ncompany owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not\nto be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). There is no assurance\nthat the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. Upon the closing of the Public Offering, management has agreed that $10.20 per Unit\nsold in the Public Offering, including the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, will be held in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) and may or\nmay not be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or\nless, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as\ndetermined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the\nCompany’s shareholders, as described below.\nF-6\nTable of Contents\nThe Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the “public shareholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their\nPublic Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii)\nby means of a tender offer. In connection with a proposed Business Combination, the Company may seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination at a\nmeeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against a Business Combination. The\nCompany will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon such\nconsummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks shareholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the\nBusiness Combination.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the\ntender offer rules, the Company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that, a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any\nother person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n“Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to 15% or more of the Public Shares without the Company’s prior written consent.\nThe public shareholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially $10.20 per share, plus\nany pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The per-share amount to\nbe distributed to shareholders who redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriter (as\ndiscussed in Note 7). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company’s warrants. These shares of\nClass A ordinary shares are recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)\nAccounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.”\nIf a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will,\npursuant to its Memorandum and Articles of Association, offer such redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the\n“SEC”), and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a\nBusiness Combination.\nThe Company’s Sponsor and Apollo have agreed (a) to vote their Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the\nPublic Offering in favor of a Business Combination, (b) not to propose an amendment to the Company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association with respect to the\nCompany’s pre-Business Combination activities prior to the consummation of a Business Combination unless the Company provides dissenting public shareholders\nwith the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment; (c) not to redeem any shares (including the Founder Shares) into the\nright to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a Business Combination (or to sell any shares in a tender offer in\nconnection with a Business Combination if the Company does not seek shareholder approval in connection therewith) or a vote to amend the provisions of the\nAmended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association relating to shareholders’ rights of pre-Business Combination activity and (d) that the Founder\nShares shall not participate in any liquidating distributions upon winding up if a Business Combination is not consummated. However, the Sponsor and Apollo will be\nentitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares purchased during or after the Public Offering if the Company fails to\ncomplete its Business Combination.\nIf the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business\ncombination is extended) from the closing of the Public Offering (the “Combination Period”), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of\nwinding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash,\nequal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to\nus to pay taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will\ncompletely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and\n(iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Company’s board of directors,\nproceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company, subject in each case to its obligations under Cayman Islands law to\nprovide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law.\nF-7\nTable of Contents\nThe underwriter has agreed to waive its rights to the deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not\ncomplete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will\nbe available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for\ndistribution will be less than the Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).\nThe Sponsor and Apollo have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to the Founder Shares and Private\nPlacement Warrants it will receive if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor, Apollo or any of\ntheir respective affiliates acquire Public Shares, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete\na Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6)\nheld in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, and in such event, such amounts will\nbe included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is\npossible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).\nIn order to protect the amounts held in the trust, the Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party\nfor services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent,\nconfidentiality or similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.20 per Public\nShare and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the day of liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.20 per share due to\nreductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business\nwho executed a waiver of any and all rights to monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the\nCompany’s indemnity of the underwriter of Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities\nAct”). However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the\nSponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and believe that the Sponsor’s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company\ncannot assure its shareholders that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of the Company’s officers or directors will indemnify the Company\nfor claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the\nSponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or\nother entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held\nin the Trust Account.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $627,628 and $1,050,670 in its operating bank account, respectively, and\nworking capital of approximately $176,944.\nThe Company’s liquidity needs to date have been satisfied through a payment of $25,000 from the Sponsor to purchase the Founder Shares, the loan from the\nSponsor under the Note (as defined in Note 4), and the proceeds from the consummation of the Private Placement not held in the Trust Account of $2.2 million. The\nCompany repaid the Note in full on December 6, 2021. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an\naffiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company Working Capital Loans (as defined in\nNote 5). As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there were no amounts outstanding under any Working Capital Loans.\nBased on the foregoing, management believes that the Company will have sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity from the Sponsor or an affiliate\nof the Sponsor, or certain of the Company’s officers and directors to meet its needs through the earlier of the consummation of a Business Combination or one year\nfrom this filing. Over this time period, the Company will be using these funds for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial\nBusiness Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge\nwith or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination.\nIn connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with the authoritative guidance in FASB Accounting\nStandards Update (“ASU”) 2014-15, “Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.” The Company has until June 6, 2023, 18\nmonths from the closing of the IPO, to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by\nthat specified period. If a Business Combination is not consummated by June 6, 2023, and the Company decides not to extend the period of time to consummate a\nBusiness Combination, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution.\nF-8\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s evaluation of its liquidity condition and the date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the\nCompany’s ability to continue as a going concern one year from the date that these financial statements are issued. These financial statements do not include any\nadjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as\na going concern.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nManagement is currently evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the\nvirus could have a negative effect on the Company’s financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily\ndeterminable as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this\nuncertainty.\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IR Act”) was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S.\nfederal 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign\ncorporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. Because we may acquire a domestic corporation or engage in a transaction in which a domestic corporation\nbecomes our parent or our affiliate and our securities trade on US stock exchange, we may become a “covered corporation” within the meaning of the IR Act. The\nexcise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of\nthe fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are\npermitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition,\ncertain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to\ncarry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax.\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”)\nand pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nEmerging Growth Company\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of\n2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not\nemerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation\nrequirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements,\nand exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute\npayments not previously approved.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting\nstandards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities\nregistered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect\nto opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is\nirrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different\napplication dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies\nadopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company, which is neither an emerging\ngrowth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential\ndifferences in accounting standards used.\nF-9\nTable of Contents\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts\nof assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses\nduring the reporting period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of\na condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could\nchange in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution, which, at times,\nmay exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Coverage of $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on this account and management believes the\nCompany is not exposed to significant risks on such account.\nMarketable Securities Held in Trust Account\nAt December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, substantially all of the assets held in the Trust Account were held in money market funds, which primarily\ninvest in U.S. Treasury securities.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company\nhad $627,628 and $1,050,670 in cash held in its operating account as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The Company did not have any cash\nequivalents as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires an asset and liability approach to\nfinancial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statements and tax\nbases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the\ndifferences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be\nrealized.\nASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken\nor expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing\nauthorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized\ntax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The Company is currently not aware of any issues\nunder review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position.\nThere is currently no taxation imposed on income by the Government of the Cayman Islands. In accordance with Cayman income tax regulations, income\ntaxes are not levied on the Company. Consequently, income taxes are not reflected in the Company’s financial statements. The Company’s management does not\nexpect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.\nThe Company may be subject to potential examination by federal and state taxing authorities in the areas of income taxes. These potential examinations may\ninclude questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal and state tax laws. The\nCompany has completed a nexus study and believes that it is appropriately filing tax returns in which it has nexus.\nF-10\nTable of Contents\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and\nDisclosures,” (“ASC 820”) approximates the carrying amounts represented in the balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period,\nand non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually.\nThe fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in\nconnection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement\ndate. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from\nindependent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities).\nThe following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the\nassets and liabilities:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or\nliability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\nLevel 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted\nprices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs based on our assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nIn some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the\nfair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in\naccordance with ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”). Derivative instruments are initially recorded at fair value on the grant date and re-valued at\neach reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statement of operations. Derivative assets and liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current\nor non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\nWarrant Liabilities\nThe Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and\napplicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815. The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC\n480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including\nwhether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of\nprofessional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.\nFor issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional\npaid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded\nat their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-\ncash gain or loss on the statements of operations.\nF-11\nTable of Contents\nThe Company evaluated the Public Warrants (as defined in Note 7) and the Private Placement Warrants (collectively, the “Warrants”) in accordance with ASC\n815, and concluded that a provision in the warrant agreement, dated December 2, 2021 (the “Warrant Agreement”) related to certain tender or exchange offers\nprecludes the Warrants from being accounted for as components of equity. As the Warrants meet the definition of a derivative as contemplated in ASC 815, the\nWarrants are recorded as derivative liabilities on the condensed balance sheets and measured at fair value at inception (on the date of the IPO) and at each reporting\ndate in accordance with ASC 820 with changes in fair value recognized in the condensed statement of operations in the period of change.\nOffering Costs Associated with the Public Offering\nThe Company complies with the requirements of ASC 340-10-S99-1, SEC Staff Accounting bulletin Topic 5A - “Expenses of Offering”, and SEC Staff\nAccounting bulletin Topic 5T - “Accounting for Expenses or Liabilities Paid by Principal Stockholder(s)”. Offering costs consist principally of professional and\nregistration fees incurred through the balance sheet date that are related to the IPO. Offering costs directly attributable to the issuance of an equity contract to be\nclassified in equity are recorded as a reduction of equity. Offering costs for equity contracts that are classified as assets and liabilities are expensed immediately. The\nCCoommppaannyy iinnccuurrrreedd ooffffeerriinngg ccoossttss aammoouunnttiinngg ttoo $$1122,,551177,,333355 aass aa rreessuulltt ooff tthhee IIPPOO ((ccoonnssiissttiinngg ooff $$33,,779955,,000000 ooff uunnddeerrwwrriittiinngg ffeeeess,, $$66,,664411,,225500 ooff ddeeffeerrrreedd uunnddeerrwwrriittiinngg\nfees, $1,248,100 for the excess fair value of Founder Shares attributable to the Anchor Investor, and $832,985 of other offering costs). The Company recorded\n$10,788,729 of offering costs as a reduction of equity in connection with the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units. The Company immediately expensed\n$480,506 of offering costs in connection with the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants that were classified as liabilities.\nClass A Shares Subject to Possible Redemption\nThe Company accounts for its Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC 480. Ordinary shares subject\nto mandatory redemption are classified as a liability instrument and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares\nthat feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the\nCompany’s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders’ equity. The Company’s Class A ordinary\nshares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly,\nClass A common stock subject to possible redemption is presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders’ deficit section of the Company’s balance sheet.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the amount of Class A ordinary shares reflected on the balance sheet are reconciled in the following table:\nGross proceeds $ 187,750,000\nLess:\nProceeds allocated to Public Warrants (7,590,000)\nClass A ordinary shares issuance costs (10,788,729)\nPlus:\nAdjust carrying value to initial redemption value 22,173,729\nClass A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption as of December 31, 2021 $ 193,545,000\nPlus:\nAdjust carrying value to initial redemption value 2,681,283\nClass A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption as of December 31, 2022 $ 196,226,283\nNet Income Per Ordinary Share\nBasic income per ordinary share is computed by dividing net income applicable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares\noutstanding during the period. Consistent with FASB 480, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption, as well as their pro rata share of undistributed trust\nearnings consistent with the two-class method, have been excluded from the calculation of income per ordinary share for the period from March 26, 2021 (inception) to\nDecember 31, 2021. Such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of trust earnings. Diluted income per share includes the incremental number of\nordinary shares to be issued to settle warrants, as calculated using the treasury method. For the period from March 26, 2021 (inception) to December 31, 2021, the\nCompany did not have any dilutive warrants, securities or other contracts that could potentially, be exercised or converted into ordinary shares. As a result, diluted\nincome per ordinary share is the same as basic income per ordinary share for all periods presented.\nF-12\nTable of Contents\nA reconciliation of net income per ordinary share is as follows:\nFor the Period from March 26, 2021\nFor the twelve months ended (Date of Inception) through\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nClass A Class B Class A Class B\nBasic and diluted net income per share\nNumerator:\nAllocation of net income, as adjusted $ 10,126,965 $ 2,531,741 $ 484,924 $ 1,258,049\nDenominator:\nBasic and diluted weighted average ordinary shares outstanding 18,975,000 4,743,750 1,608,750 4,173,616\nBasic and diluted net income per ordinary share $ 0.53 $ 0.53 $ 0.30 $ 0.30\nStock Compensation Expense\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”). Under\nASC 718, stock-based compensation associated with equity-classified awards is measured at fair value upon the grant date and recognized over the requisite service\nperiod. To the extent a stock-based award is subject to a performance condition, the amount of expense recorded in a given period, if any, reflects an assessment of the\nprobability of achieving such performance condition, with compensation recognized once the event is deemed probable to occur. Forfeitures are recognized as\nincurred. The Company has recognized no stock-based compensation expense during the period from inception to December 31, 2022.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and\nDerivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (“ASU 2020-06”) to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06\neliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative\nscope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity’s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for\nconvertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance,\nincluding the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. As a smaller reporting company, ASU 2020-06 is effective January 1, 2024 and\nshould be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021. The Company is currently assessing the\nimpact, if any, that ASU 2020-06 would have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect\non the Company’s financial statements.\nNOTE 3. PUBLIC OFFERING\nPursuant to the Public Offering, the Company sold 16,500,000 Units at $10.00 per Unit. On December 9, 2021, the underwriters fully exercised the over-\nallotment option and purchased 2,475,000 Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $24,750,000. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary\nshare, $0.0001 par value, and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“Public Warrant”). Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary\nshare at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share (see Note 7).\nAn Anchor Investor unaffiliated with any member of our management team purchased an aggregate of 1,895,602 of the Units sold in the Public Offering.\nThese Units purchased by Apollo in this offering are not be subject to any agreements restricting their transfer. Further, Apollo purchased 175,000 founder shares at\n$0.0058 per share.\nThe Company considers the excess fair value of the Founder Shares issued to the Anchor Investor above the purchase price as offering costs and will\nreduce the gross proceeds by this amount. The Company has valued the excess fair value over consideration of the founder shares offered to the Anchor Investor at\n$1,248,100. The excess of the fair value over consideration of the Founder Shares was determined to be an offering cost in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin\nTopic 5A and 5T and were allocated to stockholders’ equity and expenses upon the completion of the Public Offering.\nF-13\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 4. PRIVATE PLACEMENT\nSimultaneously with the closing of Public Offering, the Sponsor and Anchor Investor have agreed to purchase an aggregate of 8,235,000 Private Placement\nWarrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. On December 9, 2021, the Company consummated the sale of additional 990,000 Private Placement Warrants with the Sponsor\nat a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of $990,000.\nEach Private Placement Warrant is identical to the warrants offered in the Public Offering, except there is no redemption rights or liquidating distributions\nfrom the trust account with respect to Private Placement Warrants, which will expire worthless if we do not consummate a Business Combination within the\nCombination Period. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants were added to the net proceeds from the Public Offering held in the\nTrust Account.\nNOTE 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nFounder Shares\nOn March 26, 2021, the Company issued an aggregate of 4,312,500 shares of Class B ordinary shares (the “Founder Shares”) to the Sponsor for an aggregate\npurchase price of $25,000. On December 2, 2021, the Company effected a share capitalization of an additional 431,250 Class B ordinary shares, resulting in an aggregate\nof 4,743,750 Class B ordinary shares outstanding. All share and per-share amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect the share capitalization. The Founder\nShares include an aggregate of up to 618,750 shares subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor to the extent that the underwriter’s over-allotment is not exercised in full or in\npart, so that the Sponsor will collectively own, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares after the Public Offering.\nThe Sponsor and Anchor Investor have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of its Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) one year after the\ncompletion of a Business Combination or (B) subsequent to our initial business combination (x) if the last reported sale price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or\nexceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, share dividends, rights issuances, consolidations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and other similar\ntransactions) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination or (y) the date on which we\ncomplete a liquidation, merger, share exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of our public shareholders having the right to exchange\ntheir ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property.\nAnchor Investor has not been granted any shareholder or other rights in addition to those afforded to the Company’s other public shareholders. Further,\nAnchor Investor is not required to (i) hold any Units, Class A ordinary shares or warrants purchased in the Public Offering or thereafter for any amount of time, (ii)\nvote any Class A ordinary shares they may own at the applicable time in favor of the Business Combination or (iii) refrain from exercising their right to redeem their\npublic shares at the time of the Business Combination. Anchor Investor has the same rights to the funds held in the Trust Account with respect to the Class A\nordinary shares underlying the Units they purchased in the Public Offering as the rights afforded to the Company’s other public shareholders.\nPromissory Note-Related Party\nOn April 5, 2021, the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company an aggregate of up to $300,000 to cover expenses related to the Public Offering pursuant to a\npromissory note (the “Note”). The Note is non-interest bearing and is payable on the earlier of (i) April 30, 2022 or (ii) the consummation of the Public Offering. As of\nDecember 6, 2021, the Company has drawn $165,340 on the Note, which was paid off in full on December 6, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, there were no amounts\noutstanding on the Note and further drawdowns are not permitted.\nF-14\nTable of Contents\nRelated Party Loans\nIn order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Company’s Sponsor, an affiliate of the Sponsor, or the Company’s\nofficers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (the “Working Capital Loans”). Such Working Capital Loans would be\nevidenced by promissory notes. The notes would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up\nto $1,500,000 of notes may be converted upon consummation of a Business Combination into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The warrants will be identical to\nthe Private Placement Warrants. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account\nto repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. There are no Working Capital\nLoans outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nAdministrative Support Agreement\nOn December 2, 2021, the Company entered into an Administrative Support Agreement pursuant to which the Company’s initial business combination or\nliquidation, the Company may reimburse an affiliate of the Sponsor up to an amount of $10,000 per month for office space and secretarial and administrative support.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there have been $110,000 and $8,000 in charges, respectively, related to this agreement, $18,000 of which have been\nreimbursed.\nNOTE 6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nRegistration Rights\nThe holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and any warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans (and in\neach case holders of their component securities, as applicable) are entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement effective December 2, 2021,\nwhich requires the Company to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to our Class A ordinary shares). The\nholders of the majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In\naddition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the consummation of a Business\nCombination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Company will bear the\nexpenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\nUnderwriter’s Agreement\nThe Company paid a cash underwriting discount of 2.00% of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering, or $3,795,000 due to the exercise of the over-allotment\noption in full. In addition, the underwriter will be entitled to a deferred fee of three and a half percent (3.50%) of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering, or\n$6,641,250. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a\nBusiness Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. The underwriter has reimbursed the Company for $550,000 for offering expenses. The\nreimbursement of these costs has been accounted for as a reduction to offering costs of the Public Offering.\nNOTE 7. WARRANTS\nThe Company accounted for the 18,712,500 warrants issued in connection with the Public Offering (the 9,487,500 Public Warrants and the 9,225,000 Private\nPlacement Warrants) in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40. Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity\ntreatment thereunder, each warrant much be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, the Company has classified each warrant as a liability at its fair value. This liability is\nsubject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value\nrecognized in the Company’s statement of operations.\nWarrants-Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The\nPublic Warrants will become exercisable 30 days after the consummation of a Business Combination. The Public Warrants will expire five years from the consummation\nof a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.\nThe Company will not be obligated to deliver any Class A ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a Public Warrant and will have no obligation to settle\nsuch Public Warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of\nthe Public Warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration. No\nPublic Warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their Public\nWarrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption\nfrom registration is available.\nF-15\nTable of Contents\nThe Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days, after the closing of a Business Combination, it will use its\nbest efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement registering the issuance, under the Securities Act, of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the\nPublic Warrants. The Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the shares of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon\nexercise of the warrants, to cause such registration statement to become effective and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A ordinary\nshares until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the shares of Class A ordinary shares\nissuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th business day after the closing of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as\nthere is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants\non a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption.\nRedemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $18.00. Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may\nredeem the Warrants for redemption:\n• in whole and not in part;\n• at a price of $0.01 per Public Warrant;\n• upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder and\n• if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of\nshares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three business\ndays before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.\nThe Company will not redeem the warrants as described above unless an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of\nthe Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares is available\nthroughout the 30-day redemption period. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, the Company may exercise its redemption right even if the Company is\nunable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.\nRedemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00. Once the Warrants become exercisable, the Company may\nredeem the Warrants for redemption:\n• in whole and not in part;\n• at $0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption provided that holders will be able to exercise their warrants on a\ncashless basis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares determined by reference to the table based on the redemption date and the “fair\nmarket value” of our Class A ordinary shares;\n• if, and only if, the Reference Value (as defined above under “Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds\n$18.00”) equals or exceeds $10.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant);\nand\n• if the Reference Value is less than $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a\nwarrant), the private placement warrants must also concurrently be called for redemption on the same terms as the outstanding public warrants, as\ndescribed above.\nIf and when the Public Warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may not exercise its redemption right if the issuance of shares of\nordinary shares upon exercise of the warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or the Company is unable to effect\nsuch registration or qualification.\nF-16\nTable of Contents\nThe exercise price and number of shares of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances\nincluding in the event of a share dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net\ncash settle the Public Warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds\nheld in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the\nCompany’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless. If the Company calls the\nPublic Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as\ndescribed in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants may be adjusted in\ncertain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. If the Company is\nunable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will\nnot receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with\nrespect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless.\nIn addition, if (x) the Company issues additional shares of Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with\nthe closing of its initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of Class A ordinary shares (with such issue price or\neffective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company’s board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor or its affiliates, without\ntaking into account any Founder Shares held by the Sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the “Newly Issued Price”), (y) the aggregate\ngross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the Company’s initial\nBusiness Combination on the date of the consummation of such initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price\nof the Company’s ordinary shares during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates its initial\nBusiness Combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to\n115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price and the $18.00 per share redemption trigger price described above will be adjusted (to the nearest\ncent) to be equal to 180% of the greater of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.\nThe Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants included in the Units sold in the Public Offering, except that the Private Placement\nWarrants are and the shares of ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants are not transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days\nafter the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis\nand are non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other\nthan the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the\nsame basis as the Public Warrants.\nNOTE 8. SHAREHOLDER’S EQUITY\nPreferred Shares-The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value preferred shares. On December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021\nthere were no preferred shares issued or outstanding.\nClass A Ordinary shares-The Company is authorized to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of Class A, $0.0001 par value ordinary shares. Holders of the\nCompany’s ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share.\nClass B Ordinary shares-The Company is authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of Class B, $0.0001 par value ordinary shares. Holders of the\nCompany’s ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share. On December 2, 2021, the Company effected a share capitalization of an additional 431,250 Class B\nordinary shares, resulting in an aggregate of 4,743,750 Class B ordinary shares outstanding. All share and per-share amounts have been retroactively restated to\nreflect the share capitalization.\nHolders of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all other matters submitted to a vote of shareholders,\nexcept as required by law; provided that only holders of Class B ordinary shares have the right to vote for the election of directors prior to the Company’s initial\nBusiness Combination.\nF-17\nTable of Contents\nThe shares of Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of our initial business combination, or earlier at the\noption of the holder, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for share sub-divisions, share dividends, rights issuances, consolidations, reorganizations,\nrecapitalizations and the like, and subject to further adjustment as provided herein. In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares, or equity-linked securities, are\nissued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts issued in this offering and related to the closing of our initial business combination, the ratio at which the Class B\nordinary shares will convert into Class A ordinary shares will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding Class B ordinary shares\nagree to waive such anti-dilution adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon\nconversion of all Class B ordinary shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of all ordinary shares issued and outstanding upon\nthe completion of this offering plus all Class A ordinary shares and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with our initial business\ncombination, excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in our initial business combination. The term “equity-linked\nsecurities” refers to any debt or equity securities that are convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for our Class A ordinary shares issued in a financing transaction in\nconnection with our initial business combination, including but not limited to a private placement of equity or debt.\nPursuant to and concurrently with the Public Offering, the Company sold 18,975,000 Units. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there were no Class\nA ordinary shares issued and outstanding, excluding 18,975,000 Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption (see Note 2), and 4,743,750 Class B ordinary\nshares issued and outstanding.\nNOTE 9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe following table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis on December 31, 2022\nand December 31, 2021, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value:\nSignificant\nQuoted Prices Other\nIn Active Observable\nDecember 31, Markets (Level Inputs\n2022 1) (Level 2)\nAssets:\nMarketable\nsecurities held in\nTrust Account $ 196,226,283 $ 196,226,283 $ —\nLiabilities:\nWarrant\nliabilities - Public\nWarrants $ 711,563 $ — $ 711,563\nWarrant\nliabilities - Private\nPlacement Warrants $ 691,875 $ — $ —\nSignificant Significant\nQuoted Prices Other Other\nIn Active Observable Unobservable\nDecember 31, Markets (Level Inputs Inputs\n2021 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nMarketable securities held in Trust Account $ 193,549,933 $ 193,549,933 $ — $ —\nLiabilities:\nWarrant liabilities - Public Warrants $ 6,356,625 $ — $ — $ 6,356,625\nWarrant liabilities - Private Placement Warrants $ 6,273,000 $ — $ — $ 6,273,000\nThe Warrants are accounted for as liabilities in accordance with ASC 815 and are presented within warrant liabilities on the balance sheets. The warrant\nliabilities are measured at fair value at inception and on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented within change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the\nstatements of operations. Transfers to/from Levels 1, 2 and 3 are recognized at the beginning of the reporting period in which a change in valuation technique or\nmethodology occurs.\nThe Company established the initial fair value for the warrant liabilities on December 7, 2021, the date of the Company’s Public Offering, using a Binomial\nLattice-based model for the Public Warrants, and a Black-Scholes option pricing model for the Private Placement Warrants. The Private Placement Warrants and Public\nWarrants were classified as Level 3 at the initial measurement date due to the use of unobservable inputs. The estimated fair value of Public Warrants was transferred\nfrom a Level 3 measurement to a Level 1 measurement when the Public Warrants were separately listed and traded in an active market in January 2022.\nF-18\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of Public Warrants was transferred from a Level 1 measurement to a Level 2 measurement when the\nPublic Warrants were considered to no longer have an active market.\nThe Private Placement Warrants were valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is considered to be a Level 3 fair value measurement. The key\ninputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the Private Placement Warrants were as follows as of December 31, 2022:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2022 2021\nInput\nRisk-free interest rate — 1.28%\nExpected term (years) 5.20 5.20\nExpected volatility — 12.40%\nExercise price $ 11.50 $ 11.50\nFair value of Class A ordinary shares $ 10.28 $ 9.66\nThe Company’s use of both models required the use of subjective assumptions:\n• The risk-free interest rate assumption was based on the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rate for the expected term of the warrants.\n• The expected term was determined utilizing a probability weighted term input to be consistent with the stock price and volatility inputs which are reflective\nof the probability of successful merger.\n• The expected volatility assumption was based on the implied volatility solved by calibrating the warrant value output from a Binomial Lattice based model\nto the publicly observed, traded price on each valuation date. An increase in the expected volatility, in isolation, would result in an increase in the fair value\nmeasurement of the warrant liabilities and vice versa.\n• The fair value of one Class A ordinary share is inferred by solving to the publicly-traded stock price.\nBased on the applied volatility assumption and the expected term to a business combination noted above, the Company determined that the risk-neutral\nprobability of exceeding the $18.00 redemption value by the start of the exercise period resulted in a nominal difference in value between the Public Warrants and\nPrivate Placement Warrants across the valuation dates utilized in the Binomial Lattice-based model. Therefore, the resulting valuations for the Private Placement\nWarrants and Public Warrants were determined to be within $0.01.\nThe following table presents the changes in the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments that are measured at fair value:\n$ 12,629,625\nTransfer of Public Warrants to Level 1 measurement (6,356,625)\nChange in fair value (3,228,750)\nFair value as of March 31, 2022 $ 3,044,250\nChange in fair value (1,845,000)\nFair value as of June 30, 2022 $ 1,199,250\nChange in fair value (184,500)\nFair value as of September 30, 2022 $ 1,014,750\nChange in fair value (322,875)\nFair value as of December 31, 2022 $ 691,875\nThe estimated fair value of the Public Warrants transferred from a Level 3 measurement to a Level 2 fair value measurement as of January 1, 2022.\nF-19\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 10.

It is subject\nto and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, which is incorporated by reference as an\nexhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this exhibit is a part. We encourage you to read the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association\nand the applicable provisions of the Companies Act (2021 Revision) of the Cayman Islands (the “Companies Act”), for additional information.\nGeneral\nWe are a Cayman Islands exempted company and our affairs are governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the Companies Act\nand the common law of the Cayman Islands. Pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we are authorized to issue 221,000,000\nshares, $0.0001 par value each, including 200,000,000 Class A ordinary shares and 20,000,000 Class B ordinary shares, as well as 1,000,000 preference shares, $0.0001\npar value each. The following description summarizes the material terms of our shares as set out more particularly in our amended and restated memorandum and\narticles of association. Because it is only a summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to you.\nUnits\nEach unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant entitles its holder to purchase one Class A ordinary\nshare at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of the\nCompany’s Class A ordinary shares. This means only a whole warrant may be exercised at any given time by a warrant holder. Holders will need to have their brokers\ncontact our transfer agent in order to separate the units into Class A ordinary shares and warrants. Additionally, the units will automatically separate into their\ncomponent parts and will not be traded after completion of our initial business combination.\nOrdinary Shares\nAs of March 30, 2023, there were 23,718,750 ordinary shares outstanding, including:\n• 18,975,000 Class A ordinary shares underlying units issued as part of our initial public offering (the “IPO”); and\n• 4,743,750 Class B ordinary shares held by our initial shareholders\nOrdinary shareholders of record are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by shareholders. Except as described below, holders of Class\nA ordinary shares and holders of Class B ordinary shares vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders except as required by\nlaw. Unless specified in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, or as required by applicable provisions of the Companies Act or applicable\nstock exchange rules, an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a\ngeneral meeting of the company, is required to approve any such matter voted on by our shareholders. Approval of certain actions will require a special resolution\nunder Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares that are voted, and pursuant to our amended and restated\nmemorandum and articles of association; such actions include amending our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and approving a statutory\nmerger or consolidation with another company.\nOur board of directors is divided into three classes, each of which generally serves for a term of three years with only one class of directors being appointed\nin each year. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the appointment of directors, with the result that the holders of more than 50% of the shares voted for the\nappointment of directors can appoint all of the directors. However, only holders of Class B ordinary shares have the right to appoint directors prior to or in connection\nwith the completion of our initial business combination, meaning that holders of Class A ordinary shares do not have the right to appoint any directors until after the\ncompletion of our initial business combination. In addition, prior to the completion of an initial business combination, holders of a majority of our founder shares may\nremove a member of the board of directors for any reason. The provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association relating to the rights\nof holders of Class B ordinary shares to appoint or remove directors prior to our initial business combination may only be amended by a special resolution passed by\na majority of at least 90% of our ordinary shares voting in a general meeting. Our shareholders are entitled to receive ratable dividends when, as and if declared by the\nboard of directors out of funds legally available therefor.\nBecause our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association authorize the issuance of up to 200,000,000 Class A ordinary shares, if we were to enter\ninto a business combination, we may (depending on the terms of such a business combination) be required to increase the number of Class A ordinary shares which\nwe are authorized to issue at the same time as our shareholders vote on the business combination to the extent we seek shareholder approval in connection with our\ninitial business combination.\nOur board of directors is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being appointed in each year and each class (except for those directors appointed\nprior to our first annual general meeting) serving a three-year term. In accordance with Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an\nannual general meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on Nasdaq. There is no requirement under the Companies Act for us to hold\nannual or extraordinary general meetings to appoint directors. We may not hold an annual general meeting to appoint new directors prior to the consummation of our\ninitial business combination. Prior to the completion of an initial business combination, any vacancy on the board of directors may be filled by a nominee chosen by\nholders of a majority of our founder shares. In addition, prior to the completion of an initial business combination, holders of a majority of our founder shares may\nremove a member of the board of directors for any reason.\nWe will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination\nat a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, calculated as of two business days prior to the\nconsummation of our initial business combination, including interest (net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public\nshares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.20 per public share. The per share amount we will\ndistribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriter. Our initial\nshareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and\npublic shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. The other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar\nto the one entered into by our sponsor with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after our IPO.\nUnlike many blank check companies that hold shareholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations and provide\nfor related redemptions of public shares for cash upon completion of such initial business combinations even when a vote is not required by law, if a shareholder vote\nis not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, we will,\npursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, and file tender\noffer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will require\nthese tender offer documents to contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is\nrequired under the SEC’s proxy rules. If, however, a shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or we\ndecide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, like many blank check companies, offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy\nsolicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination\nonly if we receive an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a\ngeneral meeting of the company. However, the participation of our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates in privately negotiated transactions (if any,\ncould result in the approval of our initial business combination even if a majority of our public shareholders vote, or indicate their intention to vote, against such initial\nbusiness combination. For purposes of seeking approval of an ordinary resolution, non-votes and abstentions will have no effect on the approval of our initial\nbusiness combination once a quorum is obtained. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association require that at least five days’ notice will be\ngiven of any general meeting.\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant\nto the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such\nshareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted\nfrom redeeming its shares with respect to Excess Shares, without our prior consent.\nHowever, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Our\nshareholders’ inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce their influence over our ability to complete our initial business combination, and such shareholders\ncould suffer a material loss in their investment if they sell such Excess Shares on the open market. Additionally, such shareholders will not receive redemption\ndistributions with respect to the Excess Shares if we complete our initial business combination. And, as a result, such shareholders will continue to hold that number\nof shares exceeding 15% and, in order to dispose such shares would be required to sell their shares in open market transactions, potentially at a loss.\nIf we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, our initial shareholders and Apollo have agreed to vote their founder shares and,\nwith the exception of Apollo and certain advisors to the Company party thereto, any public shares purchased during or after the IPO in favor of our initial business\ncombination. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ and Apollo’s founder shares, we would need 6,940,626, or 36.58% of the 18,975,000 public shares sold\nin our IPO to be voted in favor of a transaction, in order to have such initial business combination approved. The other members of our management team have\nentered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our sponsor with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after the IPO. Additionally, each public\nshareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all.\nPursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, if we do not complete our initial business combination before June 7, 2023 (or\nSeptember 7, 2023 if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as\npromptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate\namount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes paid or payable), divided\nby the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to\nreceive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining\nshareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case, to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors\nand in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. Our initial shareholders and Apollo have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they\nhave agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business\ncombination before June 7, 2023 (or September 7, 2023 if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended). However, our initial shareholders and\nmanagement team who acquired public shares in or after our IPO will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if\nwe fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time period. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that,\nif we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the\nliquidation of the trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law.\nIn the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company after a business combination, our shareholders are entitled to share ratably in all assets\nremaining available for distribution to them after payment of liabilities and after provision is made for each class of shares, if any, having preference over the ordinary\nshares. Our shareholders have no preemptive or other subscription rights. There are no sinking fund provisions applicable to the ordinary shares, except that we will\nprovide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares for cash at a per share price equal to the aggregate amount then on\ndeposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of\nthen issued and outstanding public shares, upon the completion of our initial business combination, subject to the limitations described herein.\nFounder Shares\nThe founder shares are designated as Class B ordinary shares and, except as described below, are identical to the Class A ordinary shares included in the units, and\nholders of founder shares have the same shareholder rights as public shareholders, except that (i) prior to our initial business combination, only holders of our Class B\nordinary shares have the right to vote on the appointment of directors, including in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and holders of\na majority of our Class B ordinary shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason; (ii) the founder shares are subject to certain transfer\nrestrictions contained in a letter agreement that our initial shareholders, directors, officers and Apollo have entered into with us, as described in more detail below; (iii)\npursuant to such letter agreement, our initial shareholders, directors, officers and Apollo have agreed to (A) waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder\nshares and, with the exception of Apollo and certain advisors to the Company party thereto, public shares held by them, as applicable, in connection with the\ncompletion of our initial business combination, (B) waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and, with the exception of Apollo and certain\nadvisors to the Company party thereto, public shares held by them, as applicable, in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended\nand restated memorandum and articles of association (1) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares\nin connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination before June 7,\n2023 (or September 7, 2023 if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) or (2) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’\nrights or pre-initial business combination activity and (C) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we\nfail to complete our initial business combination before June 7, 2023 (or September 7, 2023 if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended)\n(although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business\ncombination within the prescribed time frame); (iv) the founder shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares concurrently with or immediately\nfollowing the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder thereof, as described below; and (v) the founder shares are\nentitled to registration rights. If we submit our initial business combination to our public shareholders for a vote, our initial shareholders, directors, officers and Apollo\nhave agreed to vote their founder shares and, with the exception of Apollo and certain advisors to the Company party, any public shares purchased during or after our\nIPO in favor of our initial business combination. The other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our\nsponsor and Apollo with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after our IPO. The founder shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares\nconcurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder thereof, on a one-for-one basis.\nHowever, if additional Class A ordinary shares or any other equity-linked securities are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts issued in our IPO and\nrelated to the closing of our initial business combination, the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all founder shares will equal, in the\naggregate, on an as converted basis, 20% of the sum of (i) the total number of ordinary shares outstanding plus (ii) the total number of Class A ordinary shares issued,\nor deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the company in connection with or in\nrelation to the consummation of the initial business combination, excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into\nClass A ordinary shares issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial business combination and any private placement warrants issued to our sponsor or Apollo\nupon conversion of working capital loans, provided that such conversion of Class B ordinary shares will never occur on a less than one-for-one basis.\nOur initial shareholders and Apollo have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares until the earlier to occur of: (i) one year after the completion\nof our initial business combination; and (ii) subsequent to our initial business combination (x) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange or\nother similar transaction that results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property or (y) if\nthe closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations,\nrecapitalizations and other similar transactions) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business\ncombination. Any permitted transferees will be subject to the same restrictions and other agreements of our initial shareholders with respect to any founder shares.\nPrior to our initial business combination, only holders of our founder shares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors. Holders of our public shares\nwill not be entitled to vote on the appointment of directors during such time. In addition, prior to the completion of an initial business combination, holders of a\nmajority of our founder shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and\narticles of association may only be amended by a special resolution passed by a majority of at least 90% of our ordinary shares voting in a general meeting. With\nrespect to any other matter submitted to a vote of our shareholders, including any vote in connection with our initial business combination, except as required by law,\nholders of our founder shares and holders of our public shares will vote together as a single class, with each share entitling the holder to one vote.\nRegister of Members\nUnder Cayman Islands law, we must keep a register of members and there will be entered therein:\n• the names and addresses of the members, a statement of the shares held by each member, and of the amount paid or agreed to be considered as paid, on the\nshares of each member and the voting rights of shares;\n• the date on which the name of any person was entered on the register as a member; and\n• the date on which any person ceased to be a member.\nUnder Cayman Islands law, the register of members of our company is prima facie evidence of the matters set out therein (i.e., the register of members will raise a\npresumption of fact on the matters referred to above unless rebutted) and a member registered in the register of members will be deemed as a matter of Cayman Islands\nlaw to have legal title to the shares as set against its name in the register of members. However, there are certain limited circumstances where an application may be\nmade to a Cayman Islands court for a determination on whether the register of members reflects the correct legal position. Further, the Cayman Islands court has the\npower to order that the register of members maintained by a company should be rectified where it considers that the register of members does not reflect the correct\nlegal position. If an application for an order for rectification of the register of members were made in respect of our ordinary shares, then the validity of such shares\nmay be subject to re-examination by a Cayman Islands court.\nPreference Shares\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association authorize 1,000,000 preference shares and provide that preference shares may be issued from time\nto time in one or more series. Our board of directors will be authorized to fix the voting rights, if any, designations, powers, preferences, the relative, participating,\noptional or other special rights and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, applicable to the shares of each series. Our board of directors will be able to,\nwithout shareholder approval, issue preference shares with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of the\nordinary shares and could have antitakeover effects. The ability of our board of directors to issue preference shares without shareholder approval could have the\neffect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us or the removal of existing management. We have no preference shares outstanding at the date\nhereof. Although we do not currently intend to issue any preference shares, we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future.\nWarrants\nPublic Shareholders’ Warrants\nEach whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at\nany time commencing on the later of one year from the closing of our IPO and 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination, except as discussed in\nthe immediately succeeding paragraph. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of Class A ordinary\nshares. This means only a whole warrant may be exercised at a given time by a warrant holder. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and\nonly whole warrants will trade. Accordingly, unless you purchased a multiple of two units, the number of warrants issuable to you upon separation of the units will be\nrounded down to the nearest whole number of warrants. The warrants will expire five years after the completion of our initial business combination, at 5:00 p.m., New\nYork City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.\nWe will not be obligated to deliver any Class A ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless\na registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Class A ordinary shares underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating\nthereto is current, subject to our satisfying our obligations described below with respect to registration, or a valid exemption from registration is available. No warrant\nwill be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue a Class A ordinary share upon exercise of a warrant unless the Class A\nordinary share issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the\nregistered holder of the warrants. In the event that the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a warrant, the holder of\nsuch warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In no event will we be required to net cash settle\nany warrant. In the event that a registration statement is not effective for the exercised warrants, the purchaser of a unit containing such warrant will have paid the full\npurchase price for the unit solely for the Class A ordinary share underlying such unit.\nWe have not registered the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants. However, we have agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later\nthan 20 business days after the closing of our initial business combination, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement\nfor the registration, under the Securities Act, of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants, and we will use our commercially reasonable\nefforts to cause the registration statement to become effective within 60 business days after the closing of our initial business combination, and to maintain the\neffectiveness of such registration statement and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified\nin the warrant agreement; provided that if our Class A ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that\nthey satisfy the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b) (1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of public warrants who exercise\ntheir warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or\nmaintain in effect a registration statement, but we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the\nextent an exemption is not available. If a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th\nbusiness day after the closing of the initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any\nperiod when we will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the\nSecurities Act or another exemption, but we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent\nan exemption is not available. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of Class A ordinary shares equal\nto the lesser of (A) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of Class A ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the\n“Fair Market Value” (defined below) less the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the Fair Market Value and (B) 0.361. The “Fair Market Value” as used in this paragraph\nshall mean the volume weighted average price of the Class A ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date on which the notice of\nexercise is received by the warrant agent.\nRedemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $18.00.\nOnce the warrants become exercisable, we may redeem the outstanding warrants (except as described herein with respect to the private placement warrants):\n• in whole and not in part; •\n• at a price of $0.01 per warrant; •\n• upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and •\n• if, and only if, the closing price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable\nupon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three trading days before we send the notice of\nredemption to the warrant holders.\nWe will not redeem the warrants as described above unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares\nissuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares is available throughout the 30-day\nredemption period. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the\nunderlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem warrants even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise their\nwarrants.\nWe have established the $18.00 (as adjusted) redemption criterion discussed above to prevent a redemption call unless there is at the time of the call a significant\npremium to the warrant exercise price. If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and we issue a notice of redemption of the warrants, each warrant holder will be entitled\nto exercise his, her or its warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. However, the price of the Class A ordinary shares may fall below the $18.00 redemption\ntrigger price (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under the heading “- Warrants\n- Public Shareholders’ Warrants – Antidilution Adjustments”) as well as the $11.50 (for whole shares) warrant exercise price after the redemption notice is issued.\nRedemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00.\nOnce the warrants become exercisable, we may redeem the outstanding warrants:\n• in whole and not in part;\n• at $0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption provided that holders will be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless\nbasis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares determined by reference to the table below, based on the redemption date and the “Fair Market\nValue” of our Class A ordinary shares (as defined below) except as otherwise described below;\n• if the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $10.00 per public share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon\nexercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under the heading “- Warrants - Public Shareholders’ Warrants - Anti-Dilution Adjustments”) for any 20\ntrading days within the 30-trading day period ending three trading days before we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders; and\n• if the closing price of the Class A ordinary shares for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on\nwhich we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders is less than $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon\nexercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described under the heading “- Warrants - Public Shareholders’ Warrants - Anti-dilution Adjustments”), the private\nplacement warrants must also be concurrently called for redemption on the same terms as the outstanding public warrants, as described above.\nBeginning on the date the notice of redemption is given until the warrants are redeemed or exercised, holders may elect to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis.\nThe numbers in the table below represent the number of Class A ordinary shares that a warrant holder will receive upon such cashless exercise in connection with a\nredemption by us pursuant to this redemption feature, based on the “Fair Market Value” of our Class A ordinary shares on the corresponding redemption date\n(assuming holders elect to exercise their warrants and such warrants are not redeemed for $0.10 per warrant), determined for these purposes based on volume\nweighted average price of our Class A ordinary shares during the 10 trading days immediately following the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the\nholders of warrants, and the number of months that the corresponding redemption date precedes the expiration date of the warrants, each as set forth in the table\nbelow. We will provide our warrant holders with the final Fair Market Value no later than one business day after the 10-trading day period described above ends.\nPursuant to the warrant agreement, references above to Class A ordinary shares shall include a security other than Class A ordinary shares into which the Class A\nordinary shares have been converted or exchanged for in the event we are not the surviving company in our initial business combination. The numbers in the table\nbelow will not be adjusted when determining the number of Class A ordinary shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants if we are not the surviving entity\nfollowing our initial business combination.\nThe share prices set forth in the column headings of the table below will be adjusted as of any date on which the number of shares issuable upon exercise of a warrant\nor the exercise price of a warrant is adjusted as set forth under the heading “- Anti-dilution Adjustments” below. If the number of shares issuable upon exercise of a\nwarrant is adjusted, the adjusted share prices in the column headings will equal the share prices immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the\nnumerator of which is the number of shares deliverable upon exercise of a warrant immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator of which is the number of\nshares deliverable upon exercise of a warrant as so adjusted. The number of shares in the table below shall be adjusted in the same manner and at the same time as the\nnumber of shares issuable upon exercise of a warrant. If the exercise price of a warrant is adjusted, (a) in the case of an adjustment pursuant to the fifth paragraph\nunder the heading “- Anti-dilution Adjustments” below, the adjusted share prices in the column headings will equal the unadjusted share price multiplied by a\nfraction, the numerator of which is the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price as set forth under the heading “- Anti-dilution Adjustments” and the\ndenominator of which is $10.00 and (b) in the case of an adjustment pursuant to the second paragraph under the heading “- Anti-dilution Adjustments” below, the\nadjusted share prices in the column headings will equal the unadjusted share price less the decrease in the exercise price of a warrant pursuant to such exercise price\nadjustment.\nFair Market Value of Class A Ordinary Shares\nRedemption Date\n(period to expiration of\nwarrants) ≤10.00 11.00 12.00 13.00 14.00 15.00 16.00 17.00 ≥18.00\n60 months 0.261 0.281 0.297 0.311 0.324 0.337 0.348 0.358 0.361\n57 months 0.257 0.277 0.294 0.310 0.324 0.337 0.348 0.358 0.361\n54 months 0.252 0.272 0.291 0.307 0.322 0.335 0.347 0.357 0.361\n51 months 0.246 0.268 0.287 0.304 0.320 0.333 0.346 0.357 0.361\n48 months 0.241 0.263 0.283 0.301 0.317 0.332 0.344 0.356 0.361\n45 months 0.235 0.258 0.279 0.298 0.315 0.330 0.343 0.356 0.361\n42 months 0.228 0.252 0.274 0.294 0.312 0.328 0.342 0.355 0.361\n39 months 0.221 0.246 0.269 0.290 0.309 0.325 0.340 0.354 0.361\n36 months 0.213 0.239 0.263 0.285 0.305 0.323 0.339 0.353 0.361\n33 months 0.205 0.232 0.257 0.280 0.301 0.320 0.337 0.352 0.361\n30 months 0.196 0.224 0.250 0.274 0.297 0.316 0.335 0.351 0.361\n27 months 0.185 0.214 0.242 0.268 0.291 0.313 0.332 0.350 0.361\n24 months 0.173 0.204 0.233 0.260 0.285 0.308 0.329 0.348 0.361\n21 months 0.161 0.193 0.223 0.252 0.279 0.304 0.326 0.347 0.361\n18 months 0.146 0.179 0.211 0.242 0.271 0.298 0.322 0.345 0.361\nFair Market Value of Class A Ordinary Shares\nRedemption Date\n(period to expiration of warrants) ≤10.00 11.00 12.00 13.00 14.00 15.00 16.00 17.00 ≥18.00\n60 months 0.261 0.281 0.297 0.311 0.324 0.337 0.348 0.358 0.361\n57 months 0.257 0.277 0.294 0.310 0.324 0.337 0.348 0.358 0.361\n54 months 0.252 0.272 0.291 0.307 0.322 0.335 0.347 0.357 0.361\n51 months 0.246 0.268 0.287 0.304 0.320 0.333 0.346 0.357 0.361\n48 months 0.241 0.263 0.283 0.301 0.317 0.332 0.344 0.356 0.361\n45 months 0.235 0.258 0.279 0.298 0.315 0.330 0.343 0.356 0.361\n42 months 0.228 0.252 0.274 0.294 0.312 0.328 0.342 0.355 0.361\n39 months 0.221 0.246 0.269 0.290 0.309 0.325 0.340 0.354 0.361\n36 months 0.213 0.239 0.263 0.285 0.305 0.323 0.339 0.353 0.361\n33 months 0.205 0.232 0.257 0.280 0.301 0.320 0.337 0.352 0.361\n30 months 0.196 0.224 0.250 0.274 0.297 0.316 0.335 0.351 0.361\n27 months 0.185 0.214 0.242 0.268 0.291 0.313 0.332 0.350 0.361\n24 months 0.173 0.204 0.233 0.260 0.285 0.308 0.329 0.348 0.361\n21 months 0.161 0.193 0.223 0.252 0.279 0.304 0.326 0.347 0.361\n18 months 0.146 0.179 0.211 0.242 0.271 0.298 0.322 0.345 0.361\n15 months 0.130 0.164 0.197 0.230 0.262 0.291 0.317 0.342 0.361\n12 months 0.111 0.146 0.181 0.216 0.250 0.282 0.312 0.339 0.361\n9 months 0.090 0.125 0.162 0.199 0.237 0.272 0.305 0.336 0.361\n6 months 0.065 0.099 0.137 0.178 0.219 0.259 0.296 0.331 0.361\n3 months 0.034 0.065 0.104 0.150 0.197 0.243 0.286 0.326 0.361\n0 months - - 0.042 0.115 0.179 0.233 0.281 0.323 0.361\nThe exact fair market value and redemption date may not be set forth in the table above, in which case, if the fair market value is between two values in the table or the\nredemption date is between two redemption dates in the table, the number of Class A ordinary shares to be issued for each warrant exercised will be determined by a\nstraight-line interpolation between the number of shares set forth for the higher and lower fair market values and the earlier and later redemption dates, as applicable,\nbased on a 365 or 366-day year, as applicable. For example, if the volume weighted average price of our Class A ordinary shares during the 10 trading days immediately\nfollowing the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of the warrants is $11.00 per share, and at such time there are 57 months until the expiration\nof the warrants, holders may choose to, in connection with this redemption feature, exercise their warrants for 0.277 Class A ordinary shares for each whole warrant.\nFor an example where the exact fair market value and redemption date are not as set forth in the table above, if the volume weighted average price of our Class A\nordinary shares during the 10 trading days immediately following the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of the warrants is $13.50 per share,\nand at such time there are 38 months until the expiration of the warrants, holders may choose to, in connection with this redemption feature, exercise their warrants for\n0.298 Class A ordinary shares for each whole warrant. In no event will the warrants be exercisable on a cashless basis in connection with this redemption feature for\nmore than 0.361 Class A ordinary shares per warrant (subject to adjustment). Finally, as reflected in the table above, if the warrants are out of the money and about to\nexpire, they cannot be exercised on a cashless basis in connection with a redemption by us pursuant to this redemption feature, since they will not be exercisable for\nany Class A ordinary shares.\nThis redemption feature differs from the warrant redemption features used in some other blank check offerings, which typically only provide for a redemption of\nwarrants for cash (other than the private placement warrants) when the trading price for the Class A ordinary shares exceeds $18.00 per share for a specified period of\ntime. This redemption feature is structured to allow for all of the outstanding warrants to be redeemed when the Class A ordinary shares are trading at or above $10.00\nper public share, which may be at a time when the trading price of our Class A ordinary shares is below the exercise price of the warrants. We have established this\nredemption feature to provide us with the flexibility to redeem the warrants without the warrants having to reach the $18.00 per share threshold set forth above under\n“- Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $18.00.” Holders choosing to exercise their warrants in connection with a\nredemption pursuant to this feature will, in effect, receive a number of shares for their warrants based on an option pricing model with a fixed volatility input. This\nredemption right provides us with an additional mechanism by which to redeem all of the outstanding warrants, and therefore have certainty as to our capital structure\nas the warrants would no longer be outstanding and would have been exercised or redeemed. We will be required to pay the applicable redemption price to warrant\nholders if we choose to exercise this redemption right and it will allow us to quickly proceed with a redemption of the warrants if we determine it is in our best interest\nto do so. As such, we would redeem the warrants in this manner when we believe it is in our best interest to update our capital structure to remove the warrants and\npay the redemption price to the warrant holders.\nAs stated above, we can redeem the warrants when the Class A ordinary shares are trading at a price starting at $10.00, which is below the exercise price of $11.50,\nbecause it will provide certainty with respect to our capital structure and cash position while providing warrant holders with the opportunity to exercise their warrants\non a cashless basis for the applicable number of shares. If we choose to redeem the warrants when the Class A ordinary shares are trading at a price below the exercise\nprice of the warrants, this could result in the warrant holders receiving fewer Class A ordinary shares than they would have received if they had chosen to wait to\nexercise their warrants for Class A ordinary shares if and when such Class A ordinary shares were trading at a price higher than the exercise price of $11.50. No\nfractional Class A ordinary shares will be issued upon exercise. If, upon exercise, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will round\ndown to the nearest whole number of the number of Class A ordinary shares to be issued to the holder. If, at the time of redemption, the warrants are exercisable for a\nsecurity other than the Class A ordinary shares pursuant to the warrant agreement (for instance, if we are not the surviving company in our initial business\ncombination), the warrants may be exercised for such security. At such time as the warrants become exercisable for a security other than the Class A ordinary shares,\nthe company (or surviving company) will use its commercially reasonable efforts to register under the Securities Act the security issuable upon the exercise of the\nwarrants.\nRedemption Procedures. A holder of a warrant may notify us in writing in the event it elects to be subject to a requirement that such holder will not have the right to\nexercise such warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such person (together with such person’s affiliates), to the warrant agent’s actual\nknowledge, would beneficially own in excess of 9.8% (or such other amount as a holder may specify) of the Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding\nimmediately after giving effect to such exercise.\nAnti-Dilution Adjustments. If the number of issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares is increased by a capitalization or share dividend paid in Class A ordinary\nshares to all or substantially all holders of Class A ordinary shares, or by a split-up of Class A ordinary shares or other similar event, then, on the effective date of\nsuch capitalization or share dividend, split-up or similar event, the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable on exercise of each warrant will be increased in\nproportion to such increase in the issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares. A rights offering made to all or substantially all holders of ordinary shares entitling\nholders to purchase Class A ordinary shares at a price less than the “historical fair market value” (as defined below) will be deemed a share dividend of a number of\nClass A ordinary shares equal to the product of (i) the number of Class A ordinary shares actually sold in such rights offering (or issuable under any other equity\nsecurities sold in such rights offering that are convertible into or exercisable for Class A ordinary shares) and (ii) one minus the quotient of (x) the price per Class A\nordinary share paid in such rights offering and (y) the historical fair market value. For these purposes, (i) if the rights offering is for securities convertible into or\nexercisable for Class A ordinary shares, in determining the price payable for Class A ordinary shares, there will be taken into account any consideration received for\nsuch rights, as well as any additional amount payable upon exercise or conversion and (ii) “historical fair market value” means the volume weighted average price of\nClass A ordinary shares as reported during the 10 trading day period ending on the trading day prior to the first date on which the Class A ordinary shares trade on\nthe applicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, without the right to receive such rights.\nIn addition, if we, at any time while the warrants are outstanding and unexpired, pay a dividend or make a distribution in cash, securities or other assets to all or\nsubstantially all of the holders of Class A ordinary shares on account of such Class A ordinary shares (or other securities into which the warrants are then\nconvertible), other than (a) as described above, (b) any cash dividends or cash distributions which, when combined on a per share basis with all other cash dividends\nand cash distributions paid on the Class A ordinary shares during the 365-day period ending on the date of declaration of such dividend or distribution, does not\nexceed $0.50 (as adjusted to appropriately reflect any other adjustments and excluding cash dividends or cash distributions that resulted in an adjustment to the\nexercise price or to the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable on exercise of each warrant) but only with respect to the amount of the aggregate cash dividends\nor cash distributions equal to or less than $0.50 per share, (c) to satisfy the redemption rights of the holders of Class A ordinary shares in connection with a proposed\ninitial business combination, (d) to satisfy the redemption rights of the holders of Class A ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an\namendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (i) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the\nredemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial\nbusiness combination before June 7, 2023 (or September 7, 2023 if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended)or (ii) with respect to any\nother provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, or (e) in connection with the redemption of our public shares upon our\nfailure to complete our initial business combination, then the warrant exercise price will be decreased, effective immediately after the effective date of such event, by\nthe amount of cash and/or the fair market value of any securities or other assets paid on each Class A ordinary share in respect of such event. If the number of issued\nand outstanding Class A ordinary shares is decreased by a consolidation, combination, reverse share split or reclassification of Class A ordinary shares or other\nsimilar event, then, on the effective date of such consolidation, combination, reverse share split, reclassification or similar event, the number of Class A ordinary\nshares issuable on exercise of each warrant will be decreased in proportion to such decrease in issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares.\nWhenever the number of Class A ordinary shares purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants is adjusted, as described above, the warrant exercise price will be\nadjusted by multiplying the warrant exercise price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction (x) the numerator of which will be the number of Class A ordinary\nshares purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants immediately prior to such adjustment and (y) the denominator of which will be the number of Class A ordinary\nshares so purchasable immediately thereafter. In addition, if (x) we issue additional ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in\nconnection with the closing of our initial business combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per ordinary share (with such issue price or\neffective issue price to be determined in good faith by our board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to our sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into\naccount any founder shares held by our sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the “Newly Issued Price”), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds\nfrom such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our initial business combination on the\ndate of the completion of our initial business combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of our Class A ordinary shares\nduring the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which we consummate our initial business combination (such price, the “Market\nValue”) is below $9.20 per share, then the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and\nthe Newly Issued Price, the $10.00 per share redemption trigger price described above under “- Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share\nequals or exceeds $10.00” will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the $18.00 per share\nredemption trigger price described above under “- Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $18.00” and “- Redemption of\nwarrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00” will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market\nValue and the Newly Issued Price.\nIn case of any reclassification or reorganization of the issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares (other than those described above or that solely affects the par\nvalue of such Class A ordinary shares), or in the case of any merger or consolidation of us with or into another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in\nwhich we are the continuing corporation and that does not result in any reclassification or reorganization of our issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares), or\nin the case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation or entity of the assets or other property of us as an entirety or substantially as an entirety in connection\nwith which we are dissolved, the holders of the warrants will thereafter have the right to purchase and receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions\nspecified in the warrants and in lieu of the Class A ordinary shares immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented\nthereby, the kind and amount of Class A ordinary shares or other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, reorganization, merger\nor consolidation, or upon a dissolution following any such sale or transfer, that the holder of the warrants would have received if such holder had exercised their\nwarrants immediately prior to such event. However, if such holders were entitled to exercise a right of election as to the kind or amount of securities, cash or other\nassets receivable upon such consolidation or merger, then the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets for which each warrant will become exercisable will\nbe deemed to be the weighted average of the kind and amount received per share by such holders in such consolidation or merger that affirmatively make such\nelection, and if a tender, exchange or redemption offer has been made to and accepted by such holders (other than a tender, exchange or redemption offer made by the\ncompany in connection with redemption rights held by shareholders of the company as provided for in the company’s amended and restated memorandum and\narticles of association or as a result of the redemption of Class A ordinary shares by the company if a proposed initial business combination is presented to the\nshareholders of the company for approval) under circumstances in which, upon completion of such tender or exchange offer, the maker thereof, together with members\nof any group (within the meaning of Rule 13d-5(b)(1) under the Exchange Act) of which such maker is a part, and together with any affiliate or associate of such maker\n(within the meaning of Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act) and any members of any such group of which any such affiliate or associate is a part, own beneficially\n(within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) more than 50% of the issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares, the holder of a warrant will be\nentitled to receive the highest amount of cash, securities or other property to which such holder would actually have been entitled as a shareholder if such warrant\nholder had exercised the warrant prior to the expiration of such tender or exchange offer, accepted such offer and all of the Class A ordinary shares held by such\nholder had been purchased pursuant to such tender or exchange offer, subject to adjustment (from and after the consummation of such tender or exchange offer) as\nnearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments provided for in the warrant agreement. If less than 70% of the consideration receivable by the holders of Class A\nordinary shares in such a transaction is payable in the form of Class A ordinary shares in the successor entity that is listed for trading on a national securities\nexchange or is quoted in an established overthe- counter market, or is to be so listed for trading or quoted immediately following such event, and if the registered\nholder of the warrant properly exercises the warrant within thirty days following public disclosure of such transaction, the warrant exercise price will be reduced as\nspecified in the warrant agreement based on the Black- Scholes value (as defined in the warrant agreement) of the warrant. The purpose of such exercise price\nreduction is to provide additional value to holders of the warrants when an extraordinary transaction occurs during the exercise period of the warrants pursuant to\nwhich the holders of the warrants otherwise do not receive the full potential value of the warrants.\nThe warrants have been issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The\nwarrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder for the purpose of (i) curing any ambiguity or correct\nany mistake, including to conform the provisions of the warrant agreement to the description of the terms of the warrants and the warrant agreement set forth in the\nprospectus filed in connection with our IPO, or defective provision (ii) amending the provisions relating to cash dividends on ordinary shares as contemplated by and\nin accordance with the warrant agreement or (iii) adding or changing any provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the warrant agreement as the\nparties to the warrant agreement may deem necessary or desirable and that the parties deem to not adversely affect the rights of the registered holders of the warrants,\nprovided that the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants is required to make any change that adversely affects the interests\nof the registered holders and, solely with respect to any amendment to the terms of the private placement warrants or any provision of the warrant agreement with\nrespect to the private placement warrants, at least 50% of the then outstanding private placement warrants.\nThe warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of ordinary shares and any voting rights until they exercise their warrants and receive Class A\nordinary shares. After the issuance of Class A ordinary shares upon exercise of the warrants, each holder will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record on\nall matters to be voted on by shareholders. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. If, upon exercise of\nthe warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number of Class\nA ordinary shares to be issued to the warrant holder. We have agreed that, subject to applicable law, any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or\nrelating in any way to the warrant agreement will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of New York, and we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction will be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. See “Risk\nFactors - Our warrant agreement designates the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the sole\nand exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders to\nobtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company.” This provision applies to claims under the Securities Act but does not apply to claims under the\nExchange Act or any claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum.\nPrivate Placement Warrants\nExcept as described below, the private placement warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants sold as part of the units in our IPO.\nThe private placement warrants (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or\nsalable until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination (except pursuant to limited exceptions as described under “Principal Shareholders -\nTransfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants,” to our officers and directors and other persons or entities affiliated with the initial purchasers of the\nprivate placement warrants) and they will not be redeemable by us (except as described under “- Warrants - Public Shareholders’ Warrants - Redemption of warrants\nwhen the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00”) so long as they are held by our sponsor, Apollo or their permitted transferees (except as\notherwise set forth herein). Our sponsor, Apollo or their permitted transferees, have the option to exercise the private placement warrants on a cashless basis. If the\nprivate placement warrants are held by holders other than our sponsor, Apollo or their permitted transferees, the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us\nin all redemption scenarios and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the units being sold in our IPO. Any amendment to the terms\nof the private placement warrants or any provision of the warrant agreement with respect to the private placement warrants will require a vote of holders of at least\n50% of the number of the then outstanding private placement warrants.\nIn connection with a redemption of our warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $10.00, holders of private placement warrants who\nexercise their shares on a cashless basis would receive that number of shares determined by reference to the table set forth under “Description of Securities - Warrants\n– Public Shareholders’ Warrants.” If holders of private placement warrants elect to exercise them on a cashless basis at any time other than in connection with such a\nredemption of warrants by us, they would pay the exercise price by surrendering their warrants for that number of Class A ordinary shares equal to the quotient\nobtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of Class A ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “Sponsor Fair Market Value”\n(defined below) over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the Sponsor Fair Market Value. The “Sponsor Fair Market Value” shall mean the average reported closing\nprice of the Class A ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of warrant exercise is sent to the\nwarrant agent. We expect to have policies in place that restrict insiders from selling our securities except during specific periods. Even during such periods of time\nwhen insiders will be permitted to sell our securities, an insider cannot trade in our securities if he or she is in possession of material non-public information.\nAccordingly, unlike public shareholders who could exercise their warrants and sell the Class A ordinary shares received upon such exercise freely in the open market\nin order to recoup the cost of such exercise, the insiders could be significantly restricted from selling such securities. As a result, we believe that allowing the holders\nto exercise such warrants on a cashless basis is appropriate.\nIn order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our\nsponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into\nwarrants of the post business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. Such warrants would be identical to the private placement\nwarrants.\nDividends\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of our initial business\ncombination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial\ncondition subsequent to completion of our initial business combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to our initial business combination will be\nwithin the discretion of our board of directors at such time. We effected a share capitalization or with respect to our Class B ordinary shares on December 6, 2021, in\nsuch amount as to maintain the number of founder shares, on an as-converted basis, at 20% of the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary\nshares. Further, if we incur any indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive\ncovenants we may agree to in connection therewith.\nOur Transfer Agent and Warrant Agent\nThe transfer agent for our ordinary shares and warrant agent for our warrants is Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. We have agreed to indemnify\nContinental Stock Transfer & Trust Company in its roles as transfer agent and warrant agent, its agents and each of its shareholders, directors, officers and employees\nagainst all claims and losses that may arise out of acts performed or omitted for its activities in that capacity, except for any claims and losses due to any gross\nnegligence or intentional misconduct of the indemnified person or entity. Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company has agreed that it has no right of set-off or any\nright, title, interest or claim of any kind to, or to any monies in, the trust account, and has irrevocably waived any right, title, interest or claim of any kind to, or to any\nmonies in, the trust account that it may have now or in the future. Accordingly, any indemnification provided will only be able to be satisfied, or a claim will only be\nable to be pursued, solely against us and our assets outside the trust account and not against the any monies in the trust account or interest earned thereon.\nCertain Differences in Corporate Law\nCayman Islands companies are governed by the Companies Act. The Companies Act is modeled on English Law but does not follow recent English Law statutory\nenactments, and differs from laws applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. Set forth below is a summary of the material differences between the\nprovisions of the Companies Act applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the United States and their shareholders.\nMergers and Similar Arrangements. In certain circumstances, the Companies Act allows for mergers or consolidations between two Cayman Islands companies, or\nbetween a Cayman Islands exempted company and a company incorporated in another jurisdiction (provided that is facilitated by the laws of that other jurisdiction).\nWhere the merger or consolidation is between two Cayman Islands companies, the directors of each company must approve a written plan of merger or consolidation\ncontaining certain prescribed information. That plan or merger or consolidation must then be authorized by (a) a special resolution (usually a majority of 66-2∕3% in\nvalue of the voting shares voted at a general meeting) of the shareholders of each company and (b) such other authorization, if any, as may be specified in such\nconstituent company’s articles of association. No shareholder resolution is required for a merger between a parent company (i.e., a company that owns at least 90% of\nthe issued shares of each class in a subsidiary company) and its subsidiary company. The consent of each holder of a fixed or floating security interest of a\nconstituent company must be obtained, unless the court waives such requirement. If the Cayman Islands Registrar of Companies is satisfied that the requirements of\nthe Companies Act (which includes certain other formalities) have been complied with, the Registrar of Companies will register the plan of merger or consolidation.\nWhere the merger or consolidation involves a foreign company, the procedure is similar, save that with respect to the foreign company, the directors of the Cayman\nIslands exempted company are required to make a declaration to the effect that, having made due enquiry, they are of the opinion that the requirements set out below\nhave been met: (i) that the merger or consolidation is permitted or not prohibited by the constitutional documents of the foreign company and by the laws of the\njurisdiction in which the foreign company is incorporated, and that those laws and any requirements of those constitutional documents have been or will be complied\nwith; (ii) that no petition or other similar proceeding has been filed and remains outstanding or order made or resolution adopted to wind up or liquidate the foreign\ncompany in any jurisdictions; (iii) that no receiver, trustee, administrator or other similar person has been appointed in any jurisdiction and is acting in respect of the\nforeign company, its affairs or its property or any part thereof; and (iv) that no scheme, order, compromise or other similar arrangement has been entered into or made\nin any jurisdiction whereby the rights of creditors of the foreign company are and continue to be suspended or restricted. Where the surviving company is the\nCayman Islands exempted company, the directors of the Cayman Islands exempted company are further required to make a declaration to the effect that, having made\ndue enquiry, they are of the opinion that the requirements set out below have been met: (i) that the foreign company is able to pay its debts as they fall due and that\nthe merger or consolidated is bona fide and not intended to defraud unsecured creditors of the foreign company; (ii) that in respect of the transfer of any security\ninterest granted by the foreign company to the surviving or consolidated company (a) consent or approval to the transfer has been obtained, released or waived, (b)\nthe transfer is permitted by and has been approved in accordance with the constitutional documents of the foreign company, and (c) the laws of the jurisdiction of the\nforeign company with respect to the transfer have been or will be complied with; (iii) that the foreign company will, upon the merger or consolidation becoming\neffective, cease to be incorporated, registered or exist under the laws of the relevant foreign jurisdiction; and (iv) that there is no other reason why it would be against\nthe public interest to permit the merger or consolidation.\nWhere the above procedures are adopted, the Companies Act provides for a right of dissenting shareholders to be paid a payment of the fair value of his shares upon\ntheir dissenting to the merger or consolidation if they follow a prescribed procedure. In essence, that procedure is as follows: (a) the shareholder must give his written\nobjection to the merger or consolidation to the constituent company before the vote on the merger or consolidation, including a statement that the shareholder\nproposes to demand payment for his shares if the merger or consolidation is authorized by the vote; (b) within 20 days following the date on which the merger or\nconsolidation is approved by the shareholders, the constituent company must give written notice to each shareholder who made a written objection; (c) a shareholder\nmust within 20 days following receipt of such notice from the constituent company, give the constituent company a written notice of his intention to dissent\nincluding, among other details, a demand for payment of the fair value of his shares; (d) within seven days following the date of the expiration of the period set out in\nparagraph (b) above or seven days following the date on which the plan of merger or consolidation is filed, whichever is later, the constituent company, the surviving\ncompany or the consolidated company must make a written offer to each dissenting shareholder to purchase his shares at a price that the company determines is the\nfair value and if the company and the shareholder agree the price within 30 days following the date on which the offer was made, the company must pay the\nshareholder such amount; and (e) if the company and the shareholder fail to agree a price within such 30-day period, within 20 days following the date on which such\n30-day period expires, the company (and any dissenting shareholder) must file a petition with the Cayman Islands Grand Court to determine the fair value and such\npetition must be accompanied by a list of the names and addresses of the dissenting shareholders with whom agreements as to the fair value of their shares have not\nbeen reached by the company. At the hearing of that petition, the court has the power to determine the fair value of the shares together with a fair rate of interest, if\nany, to be paid by the company upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Any dissenting shareholder whose name appears on the list filed by the company\nmay participate fully in all proceedings until the determination of fair value is reached. These rights of a dissenting shareholder are not available in certain\ncircumstances, for example, to dissenters holding shares of any class in respect of which an open market exists on a recognized stock exchange or recognized\ninterdealer quotation system at the relevant date or where the consideration for such shares to be contributed are shares of any company listed on a national\nsecurities exchange or shares of the surviving or consolidated company.\nMoreover, Cayman Islands law has separate statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction or amalgamation of companies in certain circumstances, schemes of\narrangement will generally be more suited for complex mergers or other transactions involving widely held companies, commonly referred to in the Cayman Islands as\na “scheme of arrangement” which may be tantamount to a merger. In the event that a merger was sought pursuant to a scheme of arrangement (the procedures for\nwhich are more rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures typically required to consummate a merger in the United States), the arrangement in question\nmust be approved by a majority in number of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made and who must in addition represent\nthree-fourths in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors, as the case may be, that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting, or\nmeeting summoned for that purpose. The convening of the meetings and subsequently the terms of the arrangement must be sanctioned by the Grand Court of the\nCayman Islands. While a dissenting shareholder would have the right to express to the court the view that the transaction should not be approved, the court can be\nexpected to approve the arrangement if it satisfies itself that: • we are not proposing to act illegally or beyond the scope of our corporate authority and the statutory\nprovisions as to majority vote have been complied with;\n• the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question;\n• the arrangement is such as a businessman would reasonably approve; and\n• the arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the Companies Act or that would amount to a “fraud on\nthe minority.”\nIf a scheme of arrangement or takeover offer (as described below) is approved, any dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable to appraisal rights\n(providing rights to receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of the shares), which would otherwise ordinarily be available to dissenting\nshareholders of U.S. corporations.\nSqueeze-out Provisions.\nWhen a takeover offer is made and accepted by holders of 90% of the shares to whom the offer is made within four months, the offer or may, within a two-month\nperiod, require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such shares on the terms of the offer. An objection can be made to the Grand Court of the Cayman\nIslands, but this is unlikely to succeed unless there is evidence of fraud, bad faith, collusion or inequitable treatment of the shareholders.\nFurther, transactions similar to a merger, reconstruction and/or an amalgamation may in some circumstances be achieved through means other than these statutory\nprovisions, such as a share capital exchange, asset acquisition or control, or through contractual arrangements of an operating business.\nShareholders’ Suits. Maples and Calder (Cayman) LLP, our Cayman Islands counsel, is not aware of any reported class action having been brought in a Cayman\nIslands court. Derivative actions have been brought in the Cayman Islands courts, and the Cayman Islands courts have confirmed the availability for such actions. In\nmost cases, we will be the proper plaintiff in any claim based on a breach of duty owed to us, and a claim against (for example) our officers or directors usually may not\nbe brought by a shareholder. However, based both on Cayman Islands authorities and on English authorities, which would in all likelihood be of persuasive authority\nand be applied by a court in the Cayman Islands, exceptions to the foregoing principle apply in circumstances in which:\n• a company is acting, or proposing to act, illegally or beyond the scope of its authority;\n• the act complained of, although not beyond the scope of the authority, could be effected if duly authorized by more than the number of votes which have\nactually been obtained; or\n• those who control the company are perpetrating a “fraud on the minority.”\nA shareholder may have a direct right of action against us where the individual rights of that shareholder have been infringed or are about to be infringed.\nEnforcement of Civil Liabilities. The Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as compared to the United States and provides less protection to\ninvestors. Additionally, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to sue before the Federal courts of the United States.\nWe have been advised by Maples and Calder (Cayman) LLP, our Cayman Islands legal counsel, that the courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (i) to recognize or\nenforce against us judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any\nstate, and (ii) in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities\nlaws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory\nenforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment\nof a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the\njudgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the\nCayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a\nCayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, and or be of a kind the enforcement of which is,\ncontrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy). A\nCayman Islands Court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.\nSpecial Considerations for Exempted Companies. We are an exempted company with limited liability under the Companies Act. The Companies Act distinguishes\nbetween ordinary resident companies and exempted companies. Any company that is registered in the Cayman Islands but conducts business mainly outside of the\nCayman Islands may apply to be registered as an exempted company. The requirements for an exempted company are essentially the same as for an ordinary company\nexcept for the exemptions and privileges listed below:\n• annual reporting requirements are minimal and consist mainly of a statement that the company has conducted its operations mainly outside of the Cayman\nIslands and has complied with the provisions of the Companies Act;\n• an exempted company’s register of members is not open to inspection;\n• an exempted company does not have to hold an annual general meeting;\n• an exempted company may issue shares with no par value;\n• an exempted company may obtain an undertaking against the imposition of any future taxation (such\n• undertakings are usually given for 20 years in the first instance);\n• an exempted company may register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the Cayman Islands;\n• an exempted company may register as a limited duration company; and\n• an exempted company may register as a segregated portfolio company.\n“Limited liability” means that the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount unpaid by the shareholder on the shares of the company (except in exceptional\ncircumstances, such as involving fraud, the establishment of an agency relationship or an illegal or improper purpose or other circumstances in which a court may be\nprepared to pierce or lift the corporate veil).\nAmended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain provisions designed to provide certain rights and protections relating to our IPO that will\napply to us until the completion of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without a special resolution. As a matter of Cayman Islands\nlaw, a resolution is deemed to be a special resolution under Cayman Islands law where it has been approved by either (i) the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (or\nany higher threshold specified in a company’s articles of association) of a company’s shareholders entitled to vote and so voting at a general meeting for which notice\nspecifying the intention to propose the resolution as a special resolution has been given, or (ii) if so authorized by a company’s articles of association, by a\nunanimous written resolution of all of the company’s shareholders. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that special\nresolutions must be approved either by at least two thirds of our shareholders (i.e., the lowest threshold permissible under Cayman Islands law), or by a unanimous\nwritten resolution of all of our shareholders.\nOur initial shareholders, who collectively beneficially own 20% of our ordinary shares, will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum\nand articles of association and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. Specifically, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of\nassociation provide, among other things, that:\n• If we do not complete our initial business combination before June 7, 2023 (or September 7, 2023 if the period of time to consummate a business combination\nis extended), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days\nthereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including\ninterest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding\npublic shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation\ndistributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our\nboard of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case, to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases\nsubject to the other requirements of applicable law;\n• Prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account\nor (ii) vote as a class with our public shares (a) on any initial business combination or (b) to approve an amendment to our amended and restated\nmemorandum and articles of association to extend the time we have to consummate a business combination beyond June 7, 2023 (or September 7, 2023 if the\nperiod of time to consummate a business combination is extended);\n• In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor or any of our founders, officers or\ndirectors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an\nindependent accounting firm that such initial business combination or transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view;\n• If a shareholder vote on our initial business combination is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements and we do not decide to\nhold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, we will offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange\nAct, and will file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and\nother information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act;\n• We must consummate an initial business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the\nnet assets held in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding the amount of any deferred\nunderwriting discount held in trust) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination;\n• If our shareholders approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (i) that would affect the substance or timing\nof our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public\nshares if we have not consummated an initial business combination before June 7, 2023 (or September 7, 2023 if the period of time to consummate a business\ncombination is extended) or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, we will provide\nour public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal\nto the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of taxes paid or payable) divided by the number of then issued and\noutstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein; and\n• We will not effectuate our initial business combination solely with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.\nIn addition, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that under no circumstances will we redeem our public shares in an amount\nthat would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon completion of our initial business combination.\nThe Companies Act permits a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands to amend its memorandum and articles of association with the approval of a special\nresolution which requires the approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of such company’s issued and outstanding ordinary shares who attend and vote at a\ngeneral meeting or by way of unanimous written resolution. A company’s articles of association may specify that the approval of a higher majority is required but,\nprovided the approval of the required majority is obtained, any Cayman Islands exempted company may amend its memorandum and articles of association regardless\nof whether its memorandum and articles of association provides otherwise. Accordingly, although we could amend any of the provisions relating to our structure and\nbusiness plan which are contained in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we view all of these provisions as binding obligations to our\nshareholders and neither we, nor our officers or directors, will take any action to amend or waive any of these provisions unless we provide dissenting public\nshareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares.\nAnti-Money Laundering - Cayman Islands\nIf any person in the Cayman Islands knows or suspects, or has reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting, that another person is engaged in criminal conduct or\nmoney laundering or is involved with terrorism or terrorist financing and property and the information for that knowledge or suspicion came to their attention in the\ncourse of business in the regulated sector or other trade, profession, business or employment, the person will be required to report such knowledge or suspicion to (i)\nthe Financial Reporting Authority of the Cayman Islands, pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Law (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands if the disclosure relates to\ncriminal conduct or money laundering or (ii) a police officer of the rank of constable or higher, or the Financial Reporting Authority, pursuant to the Terrorism Law (As\nRevised) of the Cayman Islands, if the disclosure relates to involvement with terrorism or terrorist financing and property. Such a report will not be treated as a breach\nof confidence or of any restriction upon the disclosure of information imposed by any enactment or otherwise.\nCayman Islands Data Protection\nWe have certain duties under the Data Protection Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands (the “DPA”) based on internationally accepted principles of data privacy.\nPrivacy Notice\nIntroduction\nThis privacy notice puts our shareholders on notice that through your investment in the company you will provide us with certain personal information which\nconstitutes personal data within the meaning of the DPA (“personal data”). In the following discussion, the “Company” refers to us and our affiliates and/or\ndelegates, except where the context requires otherwise.\nInvestor Data\nWe will collect, use, disclose, retain and secure personal data to the extent reasonably required only and within the parameters that could be reasonably expected\nduring the normal course of business. We will only process, disclose, transfer or retain personal data to the extent legitimately required to conduct our activities of on\nan ongoing basis or to comply with legal and regulatory obligations to which we are subject. We will only transfer personal data in accordance with the requirements\nof the DPA, and will apply appropriate technical and organizational information security measures designed to protect against unauthorized or unlawful processing of\nthe personal data and against the accidental loss, destruction or damage to the personal data. In our use of this personal data, we will be characterized as a “data\ncontroller” for the purposes of the DPA, while our affiliates and service providers who may receive this personal data from us in the conduct of our activities may\neither act as our “data processors” for the purposes of the DPA or may process personal information for their own lawful purposes in connection with services\nprovided to us. We may also obtain personal data from other public sources. Personal data includes, without limitation, the following information relating to a\nshareholder and/or any individuals connected with a shareholder as an investor: name, residential address, email address, contact details, corporate contact\ninformation, signature, nationality, place of birth, date of birth, tax identification, credit history, correspondence records, passport number, bank account details, source\nof funds details and details relating to the shareholder’s investment activity.\nWho This Affects\nIf you are a natural person, this will affect you directly. If you are a corporate investor (including, for these purposes, legal arrangements such as trusts or exempted\nlimited partnerships) that provides us with personal data on individuals connected to you for any reason in relation your investment in the company, this will be\nrelevant for those individuals and you should transmit the content of this Privacy Notice to such individuals or otherwise advise them of its content.\nHow the Company May Use a Shareholder’s Personal Data The company, as the data controller, may collect, store and use personal data for lawful purposes,\nincluding, in particular:\n(i) where this is necessary for the performance of our rights and obligations under any purchase agreements;\n(ii) where this is necessary for compliance with a legal and regulatory obligation to which we are subject (such as compliance with anti-money\nlaundering and FATCA/CRS requirements); and/or\n(iii) where this is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests and such interests are not overridden by your interests, fundamental\nrights or freedoms.\nShould we wish to use personal data for other specific purposes (including, if applicable, any purpose that requires\nyour consent), we will contact you.\nWhy We May Transfer Your Personal Data\nIn certain circumstances we may be legally obliged to share personal data and other information with respect to your shareholding with the relevant regulatory\nauthorities such as the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority or the Tax Information Authority. They, in turn, may exchange this information with foreign authorities,\nincluding tax authorities. We anticipates disclosing personal data to persons who provide services to us and their respective affiliates (which may include certain\nentities located outside the United States, the Cayman Islands or the European Economic Area), who will process your personal data on our behalf.\nThe Data Protection Measures We Take\nAny transfer of personal data by us or our duly authorized affiliates and/or delegates outside of the Cayman Islands shall be in accordance with the requirements of\nthe DPA. We and our duly authorized affiliates and/or delegates shall apply appropriate technical and organizational information security measures designed to\nprotect against unauthorized or unlawful processing of personal data, and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data. We shall notify you\nof any personal data breach that is reasonably likely to result in a risk to your interests, fundamental rights or freedoms or those data subjects to whom the relevant\npersonal data relates.\nCertain Anti-Takeover Provisions of Our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that our board of directors be classified into three classes of directors and also include\nprovisions providing for advance notice procedures, inability of shareholders to call a general meeting and removal of directors only for cause and only by the board\nof directors. As a result, in most circumstances, a person can gain control of our board only by successfully engaging in a proxy contest at two or more annual general\nmeetings. In addition, prior to our initial business combination, only holders of our Class B ordinary shares have the right to vote on the appointment of directors,\nincluding in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and holders of a majority of our Class B ordinary shares may remove a member of the\nboard of directors for any reason. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association relating to the rights of holders of Class B\nordinary shares to appoint or remove directors prior to our initial business combination may only be amended by a special resolution which shall include the\naffirmative vote of a majority of our Class B ordinary shares. Our authorized but unissued Class A ordinary shares and preference shares are available for future\nissuances without shareholder approval and could be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future offerings to raise additional capital, acquisitions\nand employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved Class A ordinary shares and preference shares could render more difficult or\ndiscourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.\nSecurities Eligible for Future Sale\nWe have 23,718,750 ordinary shares issued and outstanding. Of these shares, the 18,975,000 Class A ordinary shares sold in our IPO are freely tradable without\nrestriction or further registration under the Securities Act, except for any Class A ordinary shares purchased by one of our affiliates within the meaning of Rule 144\nunder the Securities Act. All of the 4,743,750 founder shares outstanding founder shares and all of the 9,225,000 are restricted securities under Rule 144, in that they\nwere issued in private transactions not involving a public offering.\nRule 144\nPursuant to Rule 144, a person who has beneficially owned restricted shares or warrants for at least six months would be entitled to sell their securities provided that\n(i) such person is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the three months preceding, a sale and (ii) we are subject to the\nExchange Act periodic reporting requirements for at least three months before the sale and have filed all required reports under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange\nAct during the 12 months (or such shorter period as we were required to file reports) preceding the sale.\nPersons who have beneficially owned restricted shares or warrants for at least six months but who are our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the three\nmonths preceding, a sale, would be subject to additional restrictions, by which such person would be entitled to sell within any three-month period only a number of\nsecurities that does not exceed the greater of:\n• 1% of the total number of ordinary shares then issued and outstanding; or\n• the average weekly reported trading volume of the Class A ordinary shares during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with\nrespect to the sale.\nSales by our affiliates under Rule 144 are also limited by manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about\nus.\nRestrictions on the Use of Rule 144 by Shell Companies or Former Shell Companies\nRule 144 is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by shell companies (other than business combination related shell companies) or issuers that have\nbeen at any time previously a shell company. However, Rule 144 also includes an important exception to this prohibition if the following conditions are met:\n• the issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company;\n• the issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act;\n• the issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter\nperiod that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Form 8-K reports; and\n• at least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current Form 10 type information with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a\nshell company.\nAs a result, our initial shareholders will be able to sell their founder shares and private placement warrants, as applicable, pursuant to Rule 144 without registration one\nyear after we have completed our initial business combination.\nRegistration Rights\nThe holders of the founder shares, private placement warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans (and any Class A ordinary\nshares issuable upon the exercise of the private placement warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans) are entitled to\nregistration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands,\nthat we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our\ncompletion of our initial business combination. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\nListing of Securities\nOur units have been approved for listing on Nasdaq under the symbol “BOCNU.” The Class A ordinary shares and warrants comprising the units began separate\ntrading on January 24, 2022 and are listed on Nasdaq under the symbols “BOCN” and “BOCNW,” respectively. The units will automatically separate into their\ncomponent parts and will not be traded following the completion of our initial business combination.\nExhibit 31.1\nCertification Pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\nI, Richard Leggett, certify that:\n1.

References to “founder shares” are to our Class B ordinary shares initially purchased by our sponsor in a private placement prior to our initial public offering, and the Class A ordinary shares issued upon the conversion thereof as provided herein, and references to “initial shareholders” are to holders of our founder shares prior to our initial public offering.\n\nItem 1.Business.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBlue Ocean Acquisition Corp is a blank check company incorporated on March 26, 2021 as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this report as our initial business combination. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, we are a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.\n\nCompany History\n\nOn December 7, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 16,500,000 units (the “Units”), each Unit consisting of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A ordinary shares”) and one-half of one redeemable public warrant of the Company (each, a “Warrant”), each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share for $11.50 per share (subject to adjustment). The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, and the IPO generated gross proceeds of $165,000,000. Substantially concurrent with the closing of the IPO, we consummated a private placement (the “Private Placement”) with our sponsor and a fund managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, Inc (“Apollo”), of an aggregate of 8,235,000 warrants (the “private placement warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $8,235,000. On December 7, 2021, a total of $168,300,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the “Trust Account”), with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.\n\nOn December 7, 2021, the Underwriter exercised in full the option granted to them by the Company to purchase up to 2,475,000 additional Units (the “Over-Allotment Option Units”) solely to cover over-allotments, which option was granted to them under the underwriting agreement for the IPO. The sale of these 2,475,000 Over-Allotment Option Units closed on December 9, 2021, generating gross proceeds of $24,750,000. Substantially concurrent with the closing of the over-allotment option, we consummated a private placement (the “Additional Private Placement” and, together with the Private Placement, the “Private Placements”) with our sponsor of an additional 990,000 private placement warrants at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of $990,000. On December 9, 2021, a total of $25,245,000 of the proceeds from the closing of the Over-Allotment Option Units and the Additional Private Placement were deposited into the Trust Account, resulting in a total deposit of $193,545,000 in the Trust Account since the Trust Account was established. The net proceeds deposited into the Trust Account remain on deposit in the Trust Account earning interest and are available for a business combination, assuming no redemptions, after payment of up to $6,641,250 of deferred underwriting fees, before fees and expenses associated with our initial business combination.\n\nOn January 21, 2022 we announced that, commencing January 24, 2022, holders of the 18,975,000 Units sold in our initial public offering may elect to separately trade Class A ordinary shares and the Warrants included in the Units. Those Units not separated continued to trade on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “BOCNU” and Class A ordinary shares and warrants that were separated trade under the symbols “BOCN” and “BOCNW,” respectively.\n\nOn June 6, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with The News Lens Co., Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company (“TNL”), and TNL Mediagene, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly owned subsidiary of TNL (“Merger Sub”). On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the parties thereto will enter into a business combination transaction pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of TNL (the “Merger”).\n\n1\n\nOn August 29, 2023, shareholders of the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the “Extraordinary General Meeting”) in lieu of the 2023 annual general meeting of the shareholders of the Company. At the Extraordinary General Meeting, the Company’s shareholders approved the proposal to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to give the Company the right to extend the date by which it has to consummate a business combination from September 7, 2023 to June 7, 2024, by depositing into the Trust Account $60,000 for each of the nine subsequent one-month extensions. In connection therewith the shareholders of record were provided the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights (the “Extension Amendment”). Holders of 12,817,785 shares of Class A ordinary shareholders exercised their right to redemption at a per share redemption price of approximately $10.67. On September 5, 2023, a total of $136,786,445 in redemption payments were made in connection with this redemption. Following the redemption, the Company had a total of 6,157,215 shares of Class A ordinary shares outstanding.\n\nAt the closing of the transactions (the “Closing”), by virtue of the Merger, the outstanding shares and warrants will be canceled and converted into the right to receive equivalent shares and warrants of TNL, and TNL is expected to be the publicly traded company with its ordinary shares and warrants listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”).\n\nBusiness Strategy\n\nOur business strategy is to identify and complete a business combination that can create value for shareholders over time. We believe our experience and deep network of relationships will help us identify a significant number of appealing business combination opportunities and enable us to evaluate these opportunities. Our management team has significant experience in multiple business models, across geographies and markets. Moreover, we believe that our management team’s backgrounds will make us attractive, long-term partners to business combination targets and help the post-business combination company to thrive in the public markets.\n\nOur approach to sourcing and evaluating investment opportunities will draw on our management team’s experience and what we consider to be best practices for value creation. We plan to leverage our management team’s extensive experience and expertise in a methodical process to identify best-in-class initial business combination targets.\n\nAcquisition Criteria\n\nWe intend to pursue opportunities with exceptional growth companies addressing large market opportunities in highly differentiated ways. We are not limited by geography-either by focusing only on the U.S. or developed markets or by exploring only large emerging markets. We draw on our management team’s decades of global experience in sourcing transactions, understanding and conducting due diligence on new breakthrough technologies and leadership teams in order to identify and then negotiate a corporate combination. Our management team has experience in a number of areas related to business information and data, new products, digital video and audio platforms, including podcasting, sports and gaming media, and events platforms. We intend to find a target company that defines, is capable of significant and sustained growth, and relies on a disruptive and highly defensible strategy.\n\n**Valuation:** We intend to target companies whose enterprise value is greater than $200 million. Companies of this size offer the potential for significant long-term shareholder return.\n\n**High growth sectors:** We intend to seek companies within the consumer Internet sector and adjacent industry segments, including, but not limited to, online marketplaces, education technology, advertising technology and direct-to-consumer e-Commerce businesses.\n\n**Differentiation and scale:** We intend to seek to invest in a business with a clearly differentiated market strategy and a clear vision for how it will scale the business and deploy a capital infusion effectively to accelerate growth, maintain or improve margins and outlast competition.\n\n**Geography:** We intend to seek opportunities globally, with a particular emphasis on large-population, high-growth emerging regions in Asia and the Americas, including the United States.\n\n**Large market opportunities:** We intend to seek opportunities that have traction and the potential to scale significantly into leaders in their markets. The addressable size of the market has to justify not only the valuation at the time of our initial business combination but also leave considerable runway for future upside. We intend to prioritize companies that take a “winner takes most” or “first mover advantage” approach.\n\n2\n\n**Growth:** We intend to seek companies that are on a sustainable growth trajectory, benefiting from the tailwinds of global Internet adoption.\n\n**Management excellence:** We intend to look for teams that are creative, ambitious, visionary and data-driven. A consistent record of growth, experience overcoming challenges, and strategic vision are essential attributes.\n\n**Operational maturity:** We intend to seek companies which have the requisite compliance, financial controls and reporting processes in place and are ready for the regulatory requirements of a public entity.\n\n**Best-in-class technology** : Proprietary technology, or skillful deployment of technology and data, is essential to long-term success. So, too, is early-to-market deployment: Speed is a competitive advantage in the use of technology and data.\n\n**Opportunistic Strategy:** The ability to effect business transformation and achieve growth requires an adaptable, market-tested, data-driven decision-making process and an experienced team. Where a target company’s leadership may lack this experience, our team, including our board members and advisors, can bring great depth in adaptive leadership.\n\n**Benefit from being public:** We intend to work with management and stakeholders who aspire to have their company become a public entity and generate substantial growth. The benefits of transitioning from a private to a public entity may include broader access to debt and equity providers, liquidity for employees and potential acquisitions, and expanded branding in the marketplace.\n\nThese criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria and guidelines in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, would be in the form of proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we would file with the SEC.\n\nWe will have until June 7, 2024, to consummate an initial business combination, pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association which give the Company the right to extend the date by which it has to consummate a business combination from September 7, 2023, to June 7, 2024, by depositing into the Trust Account $60,000 for each of the nine subsequent one-month extensions.\n\nAcquisition Process\n\nWe intend to conduct thorough due diligence to determine a prospective target’s quality and intrinsic value. That would include reviewing financial statements, legal documents, patents and proprietary technology, and historical data. We intend to meet with members of management, consult with industry experts, clients and competitors, and seek information from analysts and others familiar with the prospective target company’s business and prospects.\n\nThe target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the Trust Account (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting commissions held in trust and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for its initial business combination. Our board of directors considered the opinion delivered by Newbridge Securities Corporation (“Newbridge”) to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion, and subject to and based on the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, limitations of the review undertaken and qualifications contained in the opinion, the proposed business combination with TNL Mediagene is fair to Blue Ocean from a financial point of view and that TNL Mediagene has a fair market value equal to at least eighty percent (80%) of the balance of funds in Blue Ocean’s Trust Account (excluding deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable).\n\n3\n\nWe anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post- business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of fair market value test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable.\n\nIn addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.\n\nIf our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemption of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.\n\nWe may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our Trust Account or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. We are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise.\n\nRedemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination\n\nWe will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest (net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the Trust Account is initially anticipated to be $10.20 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriter. The redemption rights will include the requirement that any beneficial owner on whose behalf a redemption right is being exercised must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Further, subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we will not proceed with redeeming our public shares, even if a public shareholder has properly elected to redeem its shares, if a business combination does not close. Our initial shareholders and Apollo have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and, with the exception of Apollo and certain advisors to the Company party thereto, any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. The other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our sponsor with respect to any public shares held by them.\n\n4\n\nManner of Conducting Redemptions\n\nWe will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. In the case of a general meeting, such election must be made, unless extended by us in our sole discretion, no later than two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Under Nasdaq rules, asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval, while direct mergers with our company and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would typically require shareholder approval. If we structure a business combination transaction with a target company in a manner that requires shareholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a shareholder vote to approve the proposed business combination. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other reasons.\n\nIf we hold a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will:\n\n●| conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to tender offer rules; and  \n---|---  \n●| file proxy materials with the SEC.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:\n\n●| conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e- 4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and  \n---|---  \n●| file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.  \n---|---  \n  \nSubmission of Our Initial Business Combination to a Shareholder Vote\n\nIn connection with any vote for a proposed business combination, including the vote with respect to the business combination proposal, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Blue Ocean shares in favor of such proposed business combination. In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we receive an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. In such case, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and, with the exception of Apollo and certain advisors to the Company, any public shares in favor of our initial business combination. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all. In addition, our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (a) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination by June 7, 2024 or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity.\n\n5\n\nLimitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if We Seek Shareholder Approval\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to Excess Shares (as defined below), without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the Class A ordinary shares that are part of the Units sold in the IPO could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the Class A ordinary shares that are part of the Units sold in the IPO without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.\n\nRedemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination\n\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we will have only until June 7, 2024 to complete our initial business combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination within such time period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case, to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distribution with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination before June 7, 2024.\n\nThe underwriter has agreed to waive its rights to the deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).\n\nThe Sponsor and Apollo have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to the Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants it will receive if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor, Apollo or any of their respective affiliates acquire Public Shares, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, and in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).\n\n6\n\nCorporate Information\n\nOur executive offices are located at 2 Wisconsin Circle, 7th Floor, Chevy Chase, MD 20815, and our telephone number is (240) 235-5049. We maintain a corporate website at http://www.boacquisition.com. The information that may be contained on or accessible through our corporate website or any other website that we may maintain is not part of this report and is not incorporated herein by reference. \n\nWe are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events in Current Reports on Form 8-K. These reports are available on our website. The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The SEC’s Internet Website is located at http://www.sec.gov. In addition, the Company will provide copies of these documents without charge upon request at info@boacquisition.com or by telephone at (240) 235-5049.\n\nStatus as a Public Company\n\nWe believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to a traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our Class A ordinary shares (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A ordinary shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than a typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.\n\nFurthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriter’s ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.\n\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.\n\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.\n\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.\n\n7\n\nAdditionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year or the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.\n\nCompetition\n\nWe expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other special purpose acquisition companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do, and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, we are obligated to offer holders of our public shares the right to redeem their shares for cash at the time of our initial business combination in conjunction with a shareholder vote or via a tender offer. Target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination.\n\nFacilities\n\nWe currently maintain our executive offices at 2 Wisconsin Circle, 7th Floor, Chevy Chase, MD 20815. The cost for our use of this space is included in the $10,000 per month fee we have agreed to pay to an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, administrative and support services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.\n\nEmployees\n\nWe currently have four executive officers: Marcus Brauchli, our Chairman, Richard Leggett, our Chief Executive Officer, Matt Lasov, our Chief Financial Officer, and Sean Glodek, our Vice President. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our affairs but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.\n\nItem 1A.Risk Factors.\n\n_You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all the other information contained in this report, including the financial statements. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risk factors described below are not necessarily exhaustive and you are encouraged to perform your own investigation with respect to us and our business._\n\nRisks Related to our Search for, Consummation of, or Inability to Consummate, a Business Combination and Post-Business Combination Risks\n\n _We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective._\n\nWe are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company with no operating results, and we did not commence operations until after the closing of our IPO in December 2021. Because we lack an operating history, you have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective of completing our initial business combination. We do not yet have any plans, arrangements or understandings with any prospective target business concerning a business combination and may be unable to complete our initial business combination. If we fail to complete our initial business combination, we will never generate any operating revenues.\n\n8\n\n _Our public shareholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our shareholders do not support such a combination._\n\nWe may choose not to hold a shareholder vote before we complete our initial business combination if the business combination would not require shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. For instance, if we were seeking to acquire a target business where the consideration we were paying in the transaction was all cash, we would typically not be required to seek shareholder approval to complete such a transaction. Except for as required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, the decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors, such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. Accordingly, we may complete our initial business combination even if holders of a majority of our outstanding ordinary shares do not approve of the business combination we complete.\n\n_Your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash._\n\nBecause our board of directors may complete a business combination without seeking shareholder approval, public shareholders may not have the right or opportunity to vote on the business combination, unless we seek such shareholder vote. Accordingly, your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding our initial business combination may be limited to exercising your redemption rights within the period of time (which will be at least 20 business days) set forth in our tender offer documents mailed to our public shareholders in which we describe our initial business combination.\n\n_If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our initial shareholders, Apollo and members of our management team have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public shareholders’ vote._\n\nOur initial shareholders, Apollo and management team also may from time-to-time purchase Class A ordinary shares prior to our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, if we seek shareholder approval of an initial business combination, such initial business combination will be approved only if we receive an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company, including the founder shares. If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our initial shareholders, Apollo and members of our management team have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public shareholders’ vote. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ and Apollo’s shares, we would need approximately 133,816 or 1.2% (assuming all outstanding shares are voted) of 10,900,965 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2023 to be voted in favor of a transaction, in order to have such initial business combination approved. Additionally, although none of our sponsor, officers or directors have expressed any current intention to purchase our public shares, they are not restricted from doing so and there is no ceiling on the number of our public shares they may purchase. If they purchase any of our public shares and retain such shares until any shareholders vote on our initial business combination, the approval of our initial business combination by our shareholders will be even more likely. In the event that Apollo purchases Units and votes its public shares in favor of our initial business combination, a smaller portion of affirmative votes from other public shareholders would be required to approve our initial business combination. As there is no ceiling on the number of Units that may be purchased by Apollo or on the number of our Units, shares or warrants that Apollo may purchase, the extent of Apollo’s influence on such shareholders vote may be even more significant. Accordingly, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, the agreement by our initial shareholders, Apollo and management team to vote in favor of our initial business combination will increase the likelihood that we will receive the requisite shareholder approval for such initial business combination.\n\n9\n\n _The ability of our public shareholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target._\n\nWe may seek to enter into a business combination transaction agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the business combination. Prospective targets will be aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into a business combination transaction with us.\n\n_The ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure._\n\nAt the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business combination, we will not know how many shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, and therefore will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to pay the purchase price or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to meet such requirements, or arrange for third party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares are submitted for redemption than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the Trust Account or arrange for third party financing. Raising additional third-party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. In addition, the amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriter will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with an initial business combination. The per-share amount we will distribute to shareholders who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commission and after such redemptions, the amount held in trust will continue to reflect our obligation to pay the entire deferred underwriting commissions. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business combination available to us or optimize our capital structure.\n\n_The ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your shares._\n\nIf our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to pay the purchase price or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful is increased. If our initial business combination is unsuccessful, you would not receive your pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account until we liquidate the Trust Account. If you are in need of immediate liquidity, you could attempt to sell your shares in the open market; however, at such time our shares may trade at a discount to the pro rata amount per share in the Trust Account. In either situation, you may suffer a material loss on your investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with our redemption until we liquidate, or you are able to sell your shares in the open market.\n\n_The requirement that we complete our initial business combination before June 7, 2024 may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may limit the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, in particular as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination on terms that would produce value for our shareholders._\n\nAny potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning a business combination will be aware that we must complete our initial business combination before June 7, 2024. Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination, knowing that if we do not complete our initial business combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination with any target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the time frame described above. In addition, we may have limited time to conduct due diligence and may enter into our initial business combination on terms that we would have rejected upon a more comprehensive investigation.\n\n10\n\n _Our search for a business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected by natural and man-made events and the status of debt and equity markets._\n\nOur ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by natural and man-made events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases), including as a result of increased market volatility, decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all.\n\n_As the number of special purpose acquisition companies evaluating targets increases, attractive targets may become scarcer and there may be more competition for attractive targets. This could increase the cost of our initial business combination and could even result in our inability to find a target or to consummate an initial business combination._\n\nIn recent years, the number of special purpose acquisition companies that have been formed has increased substantially. Many potential targets for special purpose acquisition companies have already entered into an initial business combination, and there are still many special purpose acquisition companies seeking targets for their initial business combination, as well as many such companies currently in registration. As a result, at times, fewer attractive targets may be available, and it may require more time, more effort and more resources to identify a suitable target and to consummate an initial business combination.\n\nIn addition, because there are more special purpose acquisition companies seeking to enter into an initial business combination with available targets, the competition for available targets with attractive fundamentals or business models may increase, which could cause targets companies to demand improved financial terms. Attractive deals could also become scarcer for other reasons, such as economic or industry sector downturns, geopolitical tensions, or increases in the cost of additional capital needed to close business combinations or operate targets post-business combination. This could increase the cost of, delay or otherwise complicate or frustrate our ability to find and consummate an initial business combination and may result in our inability to consummate an initial business combination on terms favorable to our investors altogether.\n\n_Changes in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial business combination._\n\nIn recent months, the market for directors and officers liability insurance for special purpose acquisition companies has changed. Fewer insurance companies are offering quotes for directors and officers liability coverage, the premiums charged for such policies have generally increased and the terms of such policies have generally become less favorable. There can be no assurance that these trends will not continue.\n\nThe increased cost and decreased availability of directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate an initial business combination. In order to obtain directors and officers liability insurance or modify its coverage, the post-business combination entity might need to incur greater expense, accept less favorable terms or both. However, any failure to obtain adequate directors and officers liability insurance could have an adverse impact on the post-business combination’s ability to attract and retain qualified officers and directors.\n\nIn addition, even after we were to complete an initial business combination, our directors and officers could still be subject to potential liability from claims arising from conduct alleged to have occurred prior to the initial business combination. As a result, in order to protect our directors and officers, the post-business combination entity may need to purchase additional insurance with respect to any such claims (“run-off insurance”). The need for run-off insurance would be an added expense for the post-business combination entity, and could interfere with or frustrate our ability to consummate an initial business combination on terms favorable to our investors.\n\n11\n\n _We may not be able to complete our initial business combination before June 7, 2024 in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate._\n\nWe may not be able to find a suitable target business and complete our initial business combination before June 7, 2024. Our ability to complete our initial business combination may be negatively impacted by general market conditions, volatility in the capital and debt markets and the other risks described herein. Natural and man-made events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases) may negatively impact businesses we may seek to acquire. If we do not complete our initial business combination within the completion window, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case, to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distribution with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination before June 7, 2024.\n\n_If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may elect to purchase public shares or public warrants, which may influence a vote on a proposed business combination and reduce the public float of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants._\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. Any such price per share may be different than the amount per share a public shareholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial business combination. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates, are under no obligation to do so and they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the Trust Account will be used to purchase public shares or public warrants in such transactions.\n\nIn the event that our sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination, (ii) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination or (iii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. Any such purchase will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent the purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.\n\nIn addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.\n\nIf a shareholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our initial business combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed.\n\nWe will comply with the proxy rules or tender offer rules, as applicable, when conducting redemptions in connection with our initial business combination. Despite our compliance with these rules, if a shareholder fails to receive our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, such shareholder may not become aware of the opportunity to redeem its shares. In addition, the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will describe the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly redeem or tender public shares. In the event that a shareholder fails to comply with these procedures, its shares may not be redeemed.\n\n12\n\nYou will not have any rights or interests in funds from the Trust Account, except under certain limited circumstances. Therefore, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.\n\nOur public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not consummate an initial business combination within the completion window, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Blue Ocean Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the completion window or any amendment is made with respect to any other provision of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, and (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. Our public shareholders who redeem their Blue Ocean Class A Shares in connection with a shareholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the Trust Account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not consummated an initial business combination within the completion window, with respect to such Blue Ocean Class A ordinary shares so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote.\n\nNasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\n\nOur Class A ordinary shares and warrants are listed on Nasdaq under the symbols “BOCN” and “BOCNW,” respectively. Although we currently meet the current listing standards set forth in the Nasdaq listing standards, we cannot assure you that our securities will continue to be listed on Nasdaq prior to our initial business combination. In order to continue listing our securities on Nasdaq prior to our initial business combination, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and share price levels. Generally, based on Nasdaq’s current listing standards, we must maintain a minimum market value of listed securities of $75,000,000 and a minimum of 400 holders of our listed securities. Additionally, our Units will not be traded after completion of our initial business combination, and, in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with Nasdaq’s initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements, in order to continue to maintain the listing of our securities on Nasdaq. For instance, based on Nasdaq’s current listing standards, our share price would be required to be at least $4.00 per share, the market value of listed securities would be required to be at least $75 million (or we would need to satisfy certain shareholders’ equity or total assets and total revenue requirements) and we would be required to have a minimum of 400 round lot holders (with at least 50% of such round lot holders holding securities with a market value of at least $2,500) of our securities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time.\n\nIf Nasdaq delists any of our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect such securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\n●| a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;  \n---|---  \n●| reduced liquidity for our securities;  \n---|---  \n●| a determination that our Class A ordinary shares are a “penny stock” which will require brokers trading in our Class A ordinary shares to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;  \n---|---  \n●| a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and  \n---|---  \n●| a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.  \n---|---  \n  \n13\n\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as “covered securities.” Because our Class A ordinary shares and warrants are listed on Nasdaq, our Units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants currently qualify as covered securities under the statute. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of covered securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, other than the State of Idaho, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on Nasdaq, our securities would not qualify as covered securities under the statute and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\n\nYou will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies.\n\nSince the net proceeds of our IPO and the Private Placements are intended to be used to complete an initial business combination, we may be deemed to be a “blank check” company under the United States securities laws. However, because we have net tangible assets in excess of $5,000,000 and have filed a Current Report on Form 8-K, including an audited balance sheet of the company demonstrating this fact, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors in blank check companies, such as Rule 419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules. Among other things, this means we will have a longer period of time to complete our initial business combination than do companies subject to Rule 419. Moreover, if our IPO had been subject to Rule 419, that rule would have prohibited the release of any interest earned on funds held in the Trust Account to us unless and until the funds in the Trust Account were released to us in connection with our completion of an initial business combination. \n\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, and if you or a “group” of shareholders are deemed to hold in excess of 15% of our Class A ordinary shares, you will lose the ability to redeem all such shares in excess of 15% of our Class A ordinary shares.\n\nIf we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the Class A ordinary shares that are part of the Units sold in the IPO, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares,” without our prior consent. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Your inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce your influence over our ability to complete our initial business combination and you could suffer a material loss on your investment in us if you sell Excess Shares in open market transactions. Additionally, you will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if we complete our initial business combination. And as a result, you will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding 15% and, in order to dispose of such shares, would be required to sell your shares in open market transactions, potentially at a loss.\n\nBecause of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.20 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless.\n\nWe expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other special purpose acquisition companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries.\n\n14\n\nMany of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of the IPO and the Private Placements, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, we are obligated to offer holders of our public shares the right to redeem their shares for cash at the time of our initial business combination in conjunction with a shareholder vote or via a tender offer. Target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination.\n\nIf we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.20 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless.\n\nWe may not be able to complete an initial business combination with a U.S. target company if such initial business combination would be subject to U.S. foreign investment regulations and review by a U.S. government entity such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”), or may be ultimately prohibited.\n\nCFIUS is an interagency committee authorized to review certain transactions involving foreign investment in the United States by foreign persons in order to determine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the United States. Were we considered to be a “foreign person” under such rules and regulations, any proposed business combination between us and a U.S. business engaged in a regulated industry or which may affect national security could be subject to such foreign ownership restrictions and/or CFIUS review. The scope of CFIUS was expanded by the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (“FIRRMA”) to include certain non-controlling investments in sensitive U.S. businesses and certain acquisitions of real estate even with no underlying U.S. business. FIRRMA, and subsequent implementing regulations that are now in force, also subject certain categories of investments to mandatory filings. If our potential initial business combination with a U.S. business falls within the scope of foreign ownership restrictions, we may be unable to consummate an initial business combination with such business. In addition, if our potential business combination falls within CFIUS’s jurisdiction, we may be required to make a mandatory filing or determine to submit a voluntary notice to CFIUS, or to proceed with the initial business combination without notifying CFIUS and risk CFIUS intervention, before or after closing the initial business combination. CFIUS may decide to block or delay our initial business combination, impose conditions to mitigate national security concerns with respect to such initial business combination or order us to divest all or a portion of a U.S. business of the combined company if we had proceeded without first obtaining CFIUS clearance. The foreign ownership limitations, and the potential impact of CFIUS, may limit the attractiveness of a transaction with us or prevent us from pursuing certain initial business combination opportunities that we believe would otherwise be beneficial to us and our shareholders. As a result, the pool of potential targets with which we could complete an initial business combination may be limited and we may be adversely affected in terms of competing with other special purpose acquisition companies which do not have similar foreign ownership issues. Moreover, the process of government review, whether by CFIUS or otherwise, could be lengthy. Because we have only a limited time to complete our initial business combination, our failure to obtain any required approvals within the requisite time period may require us to liquidate. If we liquidate, our public shareholders may only receive $10.20 per public share, and our warrants will expire worthless. This will also cause you to lose any potential investment opportunity in a target company and the chance of realizing future gains on your investment through any price appreciation in the combined company.\n\nIf the proceeds not being held in the Trust Account are insufficient to allow us to operate for at least 18 months (or up to 21 months if the period of time to consummate a business combination is extended) following the closing of our IPO, it could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination, and we will depend on loans from our sponsor or management team to fund our search and to complete our initial business combination.\n\nSubsequent to the use of our proceeds from our IPO and the Private Placements, as of December 31, 2023 approximately $61,977 was available to us outside the Trust Account to fund our working capital requirements. We believe that these funds combined with our access to capital under our Working Capital Promissory Notes, will be sufficient to allow us to operate at least until June 7, 2024; however, we cannot assure you that our estimate is accurate. Of the funds available to us, we could use a portion of the funds available to us to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business.\n\n15\n\nWe could also use a portion of the funds as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses from “shopping” around for transactions with other companies or investors on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business and were subsequently required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise), we might not have sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, a target business.\n\nIf we are required to seek additional capital, we would need to borrow funds from our sponsor, management team or other third parties to operate or may be forced to liquidate. Neither our sponsor, members of our management team nor any of their affiliates is under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us. Any such advances may be repaid only from funds held outside the Trust Account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial business combination. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our Trust Account. If we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. Consequently, our public shareholders may only receive an estimated $10.20 per public share, or possibly less, on our redemption of our public shares, and our warrants will expire worthless. See “-If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.20 per public share” and other risk factors herein.\n\nSubsequent to our completion of our initial business combination, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges or file for bankruptcy protection, which could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our securities, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\n\nEven if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business with which we combine, we cannot assure you that this diligence will identify all material issues with a particular target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges or file for bankruptcy protection, which could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining post-combination debt financing. Accordingly, any shareholders or warrant holders who choose to remain shareholders or warrant holders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such shareholders and warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.\n\nIf third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.20 per public share.\n\nOur placing of funds in the Trust Account may not protect those funds from third-party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (except our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public shareholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements, they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our management will consider whether competitive alternatives are reasonably available to the company, and will only enter into an agreement with such third party if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be in the best interests of the company under the circumstances. The underwriter of our IPO did not execute an agreement with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account.\n\n16\n\nExamples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason.\n\nUpon redemption of our public shares, if we do not complete our initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders could be less than the $10.20 per public share initially held in the Trust Account, due to claims of such creditors.\n\nPursuant to the letter agreement the form of which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement, our sponsor has agreed that they will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.20 per public share and (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.20 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriter of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third- party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the Trust Account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.20 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.\n\nOur independent directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the Trust Account available for distribution to our public shareholders.\n\nIn the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.20 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than $10.20 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary duties may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the Trust Account available for distribution to our public shareholders may be reduced below $10.20 per public share.\n\n17\n\nIf, after we distribute the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy or insolvency court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims of punitive damages.\n\nIf, after we distribute the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy and/or insolvency laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith by paying public shareholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages.\n\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our shareholders and the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our shareholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.\n\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy or winding- up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our shareholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.\n\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we will be required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations.\n\nWe may not hold an annual general meeting until after the consummation of our initial business combination. Our public shareholders do not have the right to appoint directors until after the consummation of our initial business combination.\n\nIn accordance with Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual general meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on Nasdaq. There is no requirement under the Companies Act for us to hold annual or extraordinary general meetings to appoint directors. Until we hold an annual general meeting, public shareholders may not be afforded the opportunity to discuss company affairs with management. Our board of directors is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being appointed in each year and each class (except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual general meeting) serving a three-year term. In addition, as holders of our Class A ordinary shares, our public shareholders do not have the right to vote on the appointment of directors until after the consummation of our initial business combination. In addition, prior to our initial business combination, only holders of our Class B ordinary shares have the right to vote on the appointment of directors, including in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and holders of a majority of our Class B ordinary shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason. Accordingly, you may not have any say in the management of our company prior to the consummation of an initial business combination.\n\n18\n\nAlthough we have identified general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, we may enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet such criteria and guidelines, and as a result, the target business with which we enter into our initial business combination may not have attributes entirely consistent with our general criteria and guidelines.\n\nAlthough we have identified general criteria and guidelines for evaluating prospective target businesses, it is possible that a target business with which we enter into our initial business combination will not meet some or all of these criteria and guidelines. If we complete our initial business combination with a target that does not meet some or all of these criteria and guidelines, such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a business that does meet all of our general criteria and guidelines. In addition, if we announce a prospective business combination with a target that does not meet our general criteria and guidelines, a greater number of shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, which may make it difficult for us to meet any closing condition with a target business that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. In addition, if shareholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, it may be more difficult for us to attain shareholder approval of our initial business combination if the target business does not meet our general criteria and guidelines. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.20 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless.\n\nWe are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent accounting or investment banking firm, and consequently, you may have no assurance from an independent source that the price we are paying for the business is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view.\n\nUnless we complete our initial business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such initial business combination or transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view. If no opinion is obtained, our shareholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will determine fair market value based on standards generally accepted by the financial community. Such standards used will be disclosed in our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, related to our initial business combination.\n\nOur ability to successfully effect our initial business combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following our initial business combination. In addition, the officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of our initial business combination. The loss of a business combination target’s key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business.\n\nOur ability to successfully effect our initial business combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. The role of our key personnel in the target business, however, cannot presently be ascertained. Although some of our key personnel may remain with the target business in senior management, director or advisory positions following our initial business combination, it is likely that some or all of the management of the target business will remain in place. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after our initial business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a company regulated by the SEC, which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements.\n\nIn addition, the directors and officers of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of our initial business combination. The departure of a business combination target’s key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. The role of an acquisition candidate’s key personnel upon the completion of our initial business combination cannot be ascertained at this time. Although we contemplate that certain members of an acquisition candidate’s management team will remain associated with the acquisition candidate following our initial business combination, it is possible that members of the management of an acquisition candidate will not wish to remain in place. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business.\n\n19\n\nOur key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination, and a particular business combination may be conditioned on the retention or resignation of such key personnel. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following our initial business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous.\n\nOur key personnel may be able to remain with our company after the completion of our initial business combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to us after the completion of the business combination. Such negotiations also could make such key personnel’s retention or resignation a condition to any such agreement. The personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. However, we believe the ability of such individuals to remain with us after the completion of our initial business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. There is no certainty, however, that any of our key personnel will remain with us after the completion of our initial business combination. We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with us. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with us will be made at the time of our initial business combination.\n\nWe may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective target business and, as a result, may affect our initial business combination with a target business whose management may not have the skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company.\n\nWhen evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target business’s management may be limited due to a lack of time, resources or information. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target business’s management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we suspected. Should the target business’s management not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company, the operations and profitability of the post-combination business may be negatively impacted. Accordingly, any shareholders or warrant holders who choose to remain shareholders or warrant holders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such shareholders and warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.\n\nCertain of our officers and directors have or will have direct and indirect economic interests in us and/or our sponsor and such interests may potentially conflict with those of our public shareholders as we evaluate and decide whether to recommend a potential business combination to our public shareholders.\n\nCertain of our officers and directors may own membership interests in our sponsor and indirect interests in our Class B ordinary shares and private placement warrants which may result in interests that differ from the economic interests of the investors in our IPO, which includes making a determination of whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. There may be a potential conflict of interest between our officers and directors that hold membership interests in our sponsor and our public shareholders that may not be resolved in favor of our public shareholders.\n\nOur executive officers and directors will allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination.\n\nOur executive officers and directors are not required to, and will not, commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our search for a business combination and their other businesses. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Each of our executive officers is engaged in several other business endeavors for which he may be entitled to substantial compensation, and our executive officers are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours per week to our affairs. Our independent directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities. If our executive officers’ and directors’ other business affairs require them to devote substantial amounts of time to such affairs in excess of their current commitment levels, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs which may have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination.\n\n20\n\nCertain of our officers and directors are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us, including other blank check companies, and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time and determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.\n\nUntil we consummate our initial business combination, we intend to engage in the business of identifying and combining with one or more businesses. Our sponsor and officers and directors are, and may in the future become, affiliated with entities that are engaged in a similar business. In addition, our sponsor, officers and directors may participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company prior to completion of our initial business combination. As a result, our sponsor, officers or directors could have conflicts of interest in determining whether to present business combination opportunities to us or to any other blank check company with which they may become involved. However, we do not believe that any potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.\n\nOur officers and directors also may become aware of business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us and the other entities to which they owe certain fiduciary or contractual duties.\n\nAccordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law: (i) no individual serving as a director or an officer shall have any duty, except and to the extent expressly assumed by contract, to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as us; and (ii) we renounce any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for any director or officer, on the one hand, and us, on the other.\n\nWe may engage in a business combination with one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors which may raise potential conflicts of interest.\n\nIn light of the involvement of our sponsor, executive officers and directors with other entities, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors. Our directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities. In addition, our sponsor and our officers and directors may sponsor or form other special purpose acquisition companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an initial business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target. However, we do not believe that any potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Such entities may compete with us for business combination opportunities. Our sponsor, officers and directors are not currently aware of any specific opportunities for us to complete our initial business combination with any entities with which they are affiliated, and there have been no substantive discussions concerning a business combination with any such entity or entities. Despite our agreement to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm regarding the fairness to our company from a financial point of view of a business combination with one or more domestic or international businesses affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, potential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the business combination may not be as advantageous to our public shareholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest.\n\n21\n\nSince our sponsor, executive officers and directors will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed (other than with respect to public shares they may acquire), a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, our initial shareholders, Apollo and members of our management team held an aggregate of 4,743,750 Class B ordinary shares. The founder shares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination. In addition, as of December 31, 2023 our sponsor and Apollo held an aggregate of 9,225,000 private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share (subject to adjustment). 9,125,000 private placement warrants are held by our sponsor and 100,000 private placement warrants are held by Apollo. If we do not complete our initial business combination within the applicable time period, the private placement warrants will expire worthless. In the event that our sponsor deems it necessary in order to facilitate our initial business combination for the sponsor to forfeit, transfer, exchange or amend the terms of all or any portion of the private placement warrants or to enter into any other arrangements with respect to the private placement warrants (including, without limitation, a transfer of the sponsor’s membership interests representing an interest in the private placement warrants) to facilitate the consummation of such business combination, such change shall apply pro rata to Apollo and our sponsor based on the relative number of private placement warrants held by each. By way of example, in the event 50% of the sponsor’s private placement warrants are forfeited or transferred by the sponsor as part of such business combination, Apollo shall forfeit or transfer 50% of its private placement warrants on substantially the same terms and conditions as the sponsor, in which case the reduction shall equal 50% of the private placement warrants held by Apollo at such time. The personal and financial interests of our executive officers and directors may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business combination, completing an initial business combination and influencing the operation of the business following the initial business combination. This risk may become more acute as the deadline for completing of an initial business combination nears. \n\nConcentration of ownership among our sponsor and Apollo may prevent other investors from influencing significant corporate decisions or adversely affect the trading price of our public shares.\n\nOur sponsor, Apollo and members of our management team own collectively 48.9% of our outstanding ordinary shares. As a result, our sponsor and Apollo could exercise significant influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval. This potential concentration of influence could be disadvantageous to other shareholders with interests different from those of our sponsor or Apollo. In addition, this potential significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our public shares because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with principal shareholders. Furthermore, the Units (including the underlying public shares and warrants) Apollo may purchase in the open market will not be subject to any agreements restricting their transfer, and therefore sales of such securities on the open market may adversely affect the prevailing market prices for our units, Class A Ordinary Shares or warrants, as applicable.\n\nWe may only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of our IPO and Private Placements, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which may have a limited number of products or services. This lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations and profitability.\n\nAs of March 15, 2024, the Trust Account held $67,971,241 in funds available to complete our initial business combination (which includes $6,641,250 of deferred underwriting commissions being held in the Trust Account).\n\nWe may effectuate our initial business combination with a single-target business or multiple-target businesses simultaneously or within a short period of time. However, we may not be able to effectuate our initial business combination with more than one target business because of various factors, including the existence of complex accounting issues and the requirement that we prepare and file pro forma financial statements with the SEC that present operating results and the financial condition of several target businesses as if they had been operated on a combined basis. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be:\n\n●| solely dependent upon the performance of a single business, property or asset; or  \n---|---  \n●| dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.  \n---|---  \n  \nThis lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial business combination.\n\n22\n\nWe may attempt to simultaneously complete business combinations with multiple prospective targets, which may hinder our ability to complete our initial business combination and give rise to increased costs and risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability.\n\nIf we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses that are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete our initial business combination. With multiple business combinations, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business. If we are unable to adequately address these risks, it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations.\n\nWe may attempt to complete our initial business combination with a private company about which little information is available, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all.\n\nIn pursuing our business combination strategy, we may seek to effectuate our initial business combination with a privately held company. Very little public information generally exists about private companies, and we could be required to make our decision on whether to pursue a potential initial business combination on the basis of limited information, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all.\n\nOur management may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management will possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business.\n\nWe may structure our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-business combination company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new Class A ordinary shares in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new Class A ordinary shares, our shareholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding Class A ordinary shares subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority shareholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company’s shares than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain our control of the target business.\n\nWe do not have a specified maximum redemption threshold. The absence of such a redemption threshold may make it possible for us to complete our initial business combination with which a substantial majority of our shareholders do not agree.\n\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association do not provide a specified maximum redemption threshold. As a result, we may be able to complete our initial business combination even though a substantial majority of our public shareholders do not agree with the transaction and have redeemed their shares or, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, have entered into privately negotiated agreements to sell their shares to our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination.\n\n23\n\nThe provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that relate to our pre-business combination activity (and corresponding provisions of the agreement governing the release of funds from our Trust Account) may be amended with the approval of holders of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company (or 65% of our ordinary shares with respect to amendments to the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our Trust Account), which is a lower amendment threshold than that of some other special purpose acquisition companies. It may be easier for us, therefore, to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to facilitate the completion of an initial business combination that some of our shareholders may not support.\n\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that any of its provisions related to pre-business combination activity (including the requirement to deposit proceeds of the IPO and the Private Placements into the Trust Account and not release such amounts except in specified circumstances, and to provide redemption rights to public shareholders as described herein) may be amended if approved by special resolution, meaning holders of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company, and corresponding provisions of the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our Trust Account may be amended if approved by holders of not less than 65% of our ordinary shares; provided that the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association relating to the rights of holders of Class B ordinary shares to appoint or remove directors prior to our initial business combination may only be amended by a special resolution passed by a majority of at least 90% our ordinary shares voting in a general meeting. Our initial shareholders, Apollo and members of our management team, who collectively beneficially own 28.73% of our ordinary shares, will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and/or trust agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. As a result, we may be able to amend the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association which govern our pre-business combination behavior more easily than some other special purpose acquisition companies, and this may increase our ability to complete a business combination with which you do not agree. Our shareholders may pursue remedies against us for any breach of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association.\n\nOur sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to agreements with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (i) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination before June 7, 2024 or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial combination activity, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (net of taxes paid or payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. Our shareholders are not parties to, or third-party beneficiaries of these agreements and, as a result, will not have the ability to pursue remedies against our sponsor, executive officer or directors for any breach of these agreements. As a result, in the event of a breach, our shareholders would need to pursue a shareholder derivative action, subject to applicable law.\n\nA provision of our warrant agreement may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination.\n\nUnlike some blank check companies, if:\n\n(i)| we issue additional ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of our initial business combination at a newly issued price (such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by our board of directors and, in the case of any issuance to our sponsor, Apollo or their affiliates, without taking into account any founder shares held by our sponsor, Apollo or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the “Newly Issued Price”) of less than $9.20 per ordinary share;  \n---|---  \n(ii)| the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our initial business combination on the date of the completion of our initial business combination (net of redemptions); and  \n---|---  \n(iii)| the volume weighted average trading price of our Class A ordinary shares during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which we consummate our initial business combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.20 per share,  \n---|---  \n  \nthen the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, the $10.00 per share redemption trigger price will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the $18.00 per share redemption trigger price will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price. This may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination with a target business.\n\n24\n\nBecause we must furnish our shareholders with target business financial statements, we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial business combination with some prospective target businesses.\n\nThe federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historical and/or pro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with our tender offer documents, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America or GAAP, or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame.\n\nTransactions in connection with or in anticipation of our initial business combination and our structure thereafter may not be tax-efficient to our shareholders and warrant-holders. As a result of our business combination, our tax obligations may be more complex, burdensome and uncertain.\n\nAlthough we will attempt to structure transactions in connection with our initial business combination in a tax- efficient manner, tax structuring considerations are complex, the relevant facts and law are uncertain and may change, and we may prioritize commercial and other considerations over tax considerations. For example, in anticipation of or as a result of our initial business combination and subject to requisite shareholder approval, we may enter into one or more transactions that require shareholders and/or warrant-holders to recognize gain or income for tax purposes or otherwise increase their tax burden. We do not intend to make any cash distributions to shareholders or warrant-holders to pay taxes in connection with our business combination or thereafter. Accordingly, a shareholder or a warrant-holder may be required to satisfy any liability resulting from any such transactions with cash from its own funds or by selling all or a portion of such holder’s shares or warrants. In addition, we may effect a business combination with a target company in another jurisdiction (including, but not limited to, the jurisdiction in which the target company or business is located). As a result, shareholders and warrant-holders may be subject to additional income, withholding or other taxes with respect to their ownership of us after our initial business combination.\n\nRisks Associated With Acquiring and Operating a Business in Foreign Countries\n\nIf we pursue a target company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States for our initial business combination, we may face additional burdens in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing such initial business combination, and if we effect such initial business combination, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations.\n\nIf we pursue a target company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States for our initial business combination, we would be subject to risks associated with cross-border business combinations, including in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing our initial business combination, conducting due diligence in a foreign jurisdiction, having such transaction approved by any local governments, regulators or agencies and changes in the purchase price based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\n\nIf we effect our initial business combination with such a company, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated with companies operating in an international setting, including any of the following:\n\n●| costs and difficulties inherent in managing cross-border business operations;  \n---|---  \n●| rules and regulations regarding currency redemption;  \n---|---  \n  \n25\n\n●| complex corporate withholding taxes on individuals;  \n---|---  \n●| laws governing the manner in which future business combinations may be effected;  \n---|---  \n●| exchange listing and/or delisting requirements;  \n---|---  \n●| tariffs and trade barriers;  \n---|---  \n●| regulations related to customs and import/export matters;  \n---|---  \n●| local or regional economic policies and market conditions;  \n---|---  \n●| unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;  \n---|---  \n●| challenges in managing and staffing international operations;  \n---|---  \n●| longer payment cycles;  \n---|---  \n●| tax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States;  \n---|---  \n●| currency fluctuations and exchange controls;  \n---|---  \n●| rates of inflation;  \n---|---  \n●| challenges in collecting accounts receivable;  \n---|---  \n●| cultural and language differences;  \n---|---  \n●| employment regulations;  \n---|---  \n●| underdeveloped or unpredictable legal or regulatory systems;  \n---|---  \n●| corruption;  \n---|---  \n●| protection of intellectual property;  \n---|---  \n●| social unrest, crime, strikes, riots, civil disturbances and wars;  \n---|---  \n●| regime changes and political upheaval; and  \n---|---  \n●| deterioration of political relations with the United States.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe may not be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we were unable to do so, we may be unable to complete such initial business combination, or, if we complete such initial business combination, our operations might suffer, either of which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n26\n\nRisks Relating to our Securities\n\nThe securities in which we invest the funds held in the Trust Account could bear a negative rate of interest, which could reduce the value of the assets held in trust such that the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders may be less than $10.20 per share.\n\nThe proceeds held in the Trust Account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. While short-term U.S. government treasury obligations currently yield a positive rate of interest, they have briefly yielded negative interest rates in recent years. Central banks in Europe and Japan pursued interest rates below zero in recent years, and the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve has not ruled out the possibility that it may in the future adopt similar policies in the United States. In the event that we are unable to complete our initial business combination or make certain amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, our public shareholders are entitled to receive their pro-rata share of the proceeds held in the Trust Account, plus any interest income, net of taxes paid or payable (less, in the case we are unable to complete our initial business combination, $100,000 of interest). Negative interest rates could reduce the value of the assets held in trust such that the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders may be less than $10.20 per share.\n\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination.\n\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activities may be restricted, including:\n\n●| restrictions on the nature of our investments; and  \n---|---  \n●| restrictions on the issuance of securities;  \n---|---  \n  \neach of which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. In addition, we may have imposed upon us burdensome requirements, including:\n\n●| registration as an investment company with the SEC;  \n---|---  \n●| adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and  \n---|---  \n●| reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations that we are currently not subject to.  \n---|---  \n  \nIn order not to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we must ensure that we are engaged primarily in a business other than investing, reinvesting or trading of securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading “investment securities” constituting more than 40% of our assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Our business will be to identify and complete a business combination and thereafter to operate the post-business combination business or assets for the long term. We do not plan to buy businesses or assets with a view to resale or profit from their resale. We do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive investor.\n\nWe do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in the Trust Account may only be held in an interest-bearing bank demand deposit account, or invested in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Pursuant to the trust agreement, the trustee is not permitted to invest in other securities or assets. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, and by having a business plan targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses in the manner of a merchant bank or private equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an “investment company” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. Our securities are not intended for persons who are seeking a return on investments in government securities or investment securities. The Trust Account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of either: (i) the completion of our initial business combination; (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (a) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination before June 7, 2024 or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity; or (iii) absent an initial business combination before June 7, 2024, our return of the funds held in the Trust Account to our public shareholders as part of our redemption of the public shares. If we do not invest the proceeds as discussed above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to complete a business combination. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.20 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless.\n\n27\n\nIf we do not consummate our initial business combination before June 7, 2024, our public shareholders may be forced to wait beyond such applicable period before redemption from our Trust Account\n\nIf we do not consummate our initial business combination before June 7, 2024 the proceeds then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes paid or payable), will be used to fund the redemption of our public shares, as further described herein. Any redemption of public shareholders from the Trust Account will be effected automatically by function of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association prior to any voluntary winding up. If we are required to wind-up, liquidate the Trust Account and distribute such amount therein, pro rata, to our public shareholders, as part of any liquidation process, such winding up, liquidation and distribution must comply with the applicable provisions of the Companies Act. In that case, investors may be forced to wait beyond the applicable period before the redemption proceeds of our Trust Account become available to them, and they receive the return of their pro rata portion of the proceeds from our Trust Account. We have no obligation to return funds to investors prior to the date of our redemption or liquidation unless, prior thereto, we consummate our initial business combination or amend certain provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, and only then in cases where investors have sought to redeem their Class A ordinary shares. Only upon our redemption or any liquidation will public shareholders be entitled to distributions if we do not complete our initial business combination and do not amend certain provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the Trust Account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law.\n\nOur shareholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares.\n\nIf we are forced to enter into an insolvent liquidation, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed as an unlawful payment if it was proved that immediately following the date on which the distribution was made, we were unable to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. As a result, a liquidator could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to us or our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing themselves and our company to claims, by paying public shareholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. We and our directors and officers who knowingly and willfully authorized or permitted any distribution to be paid out of our share premium account while we were unable to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business would be guilty of an offence and may be liable for a fine of approximately $18,000 and imprisonment for five years in the Cayman Islands.\n\n28\n\nWe have not registered the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and such registration may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its warrants except on a cashless basis and potentially causing such warrants to expire worthless.\n\nWe have not registered the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. However, under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed that, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 20 business days after the closing of our initial business combination, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the issuance of such shares, and we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement to become effective within 60 business days after the closing of our initial business combination and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if, for example, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement or prospectus, the financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current, complete or correct or the SEC issues a stop order. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act in accordance with the above requirements, we will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, in which case, the number of Class A ordinary shares that you will receive upon cashless exercise will be based on a formula subject to a maximum amount of shares equal to 0.361 Class A ordinary shares per warrant (subject to adjustment). However, no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available. Notwithstanding the above, if our Class A ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a “covered security” under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of public warrants who seek to exercise their warrants to do so on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. Exercising the warrants on a cashless basis could have the effect of reducing the potential “upside” of the holder’s investment in our company because the warrant holder will hold a smaller number of Class A ordinary shares upon a cashless exercise of the warrants they hold. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant, or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under applicable state securities laws and no exemption is available. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holder of such warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of Units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units. There may be a circumstance where an exemption from registration exists for holders of our private placement warrants to exercise their warrants while a corresponding exemption does not exist for holders of the public warrants. In such an instance, our sponsor, Apollo and their permitted transferees (which may include our directors and executive officers) would be able to exercise their warrants and sell the ordinary shares underlying their warrants while holders of our public warrants would not be able to exercise their warrants and sell the underlying ordinary shares. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying Class A ordinary shares for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem the warrants as set forth above even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise their warrants.\n\nThe warrants may become exercisable and redeemable for a security other than the Class A ordinary shares, and you will not have any information regarding such other security at this time.\n\nIn certain situations, including if we are not the surviving entity in our initial business combination, the warrants may become exercisable for a security other than the Class A ordinary shares. As a result, if the surviving company redeems your warrants for securities pursuant to the warrant agreement, you may receive a security in a company of which you do not have information at this time. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, the surviving company will be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to register the issuance of the security underlying the warrants within 20 business days of the closing of an initial business combination.\n\n29\n\nCertain of our warrants are accounted for as a warrant liability and are recorded at fair value upon issuance with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our ordinary shares or may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination.\n\nWe have accounted for the 18,712,500 warrants issued in our IPO (the 9,487,500 public warrants and the 9,225,000 private placement warrants) in accordance with the guidance contained in Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (ASC 815-40). Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each warrant must be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, we classify each warrant as a liability at its fair value. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in our statement of operations and therefore our reported earnings. The warrants are also subject to re- evaluation of the proper classification and accounting treatment at each reporting period based on evolving regulatory guidance. The impact of changes in fair value on earnings may have an adverse effect on the market price of our ordinary shares. In addition, potential targets may seek a SPAC that does not have warrants that are accounted for as a warrant liability, which may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination with a target business.\n\nThe grant of registration rights to our initial shareholders and holders of our private placement warrants may make it more difficult to complete our initial business combination, and the future exercise of such rights may adversely affect the market price of our Class A ordinary shares.\n\nWe have entered into an agreement pursuant to which our initial shareholders and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the resale of the Class A ordinary shares into which founder shares are convertible, holders of our private placement warrants and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the private placement warrants and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants and holders of warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans may demand that we register such warrants or the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of such warrants. The registration rights will be exercisable with respect to the founder shares and the private placement warrants and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of such private placement warrants. We will bear the cost of registering these securities. The registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares. In addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial business combination more costly or difficult to conclude. This is because the shareholders of the target business may increase the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of our securities that is expected when the securities owned by our initial shareholders, holders of our private placement warrants or their respective permitted transferees are registered for resale.\n\nBecause we are not limited to evaluating a target business in a particular industry sector, you will be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of any particular target business’s operations.\n\nWe may pursue business combination opportunities in any sector, except that we are not, under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, permitted to effectuate our initial business combination solely with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. To the extent we complete our initial business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which we combine. For example, if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development stage entity. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our Units will ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a business combination target. Accordingly, any shareholders or warrant holders who choose to remain shareholders or warrant holders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such shareholders and warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.\n\n30\n\nWe may seek business combination opportunities in industries or sectors which may or may not be outside of our management’s areas of expertise.\n\nWe will consider a business combination outside of our management’s area of expertise if a business combination candidate is presented to us and we determine that such candidate offers an attractive acquisition opportunity for our company. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular business combination candidate, we cannot assure you that we will adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our Units will not ultimately prove to be less favorable than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in a business combination candidate. In the event we elect to pursue an acquisition outside of the areas of our management’s expertise, our management’s expertise may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation, and the information contained in this report regarding the areas of our management’s expertise would not be relevant to an understanding of the business that we elect to acquire. As a result, our management may not be able to adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. Accordingly, any shareholders or warrant holders who choose to remain shareholders or warrant holders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such shareholders and warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.\n\nWe may issue additional Class A ordinary shares or preference shares to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination. We may also issue Class A ordinary shares upon the conversion of the founder shares at a ratio greater than one-to-one concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination as a result of the anti-dilution provisions contained in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our shareholders and likely present other risks.\n\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association authorize the issuance of up to 200,000,000 Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, 20,000,000 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, and 1,000,000 preference shares, par value $0.0001 per share. As of March 21, 2024, there were 193,842,785 and 15,256,250 authorized but unissued Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares, respectively, available for issuance, which amount does not take into account shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of issued and outstanding warrants or shares issuable upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares. The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder thereof. As of March 21, 2024, there were no preference shares outstanding. We may issue a substantial number of additional Class A ordinary shares or preference shares to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination. We may also issue Class A ordinary shares in connection with our redeeming the warrants or upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares at a ratio greater than one-to-one concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination as a result of the anti-dilution provisions as set forth herein. However, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide, among other things, that prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the Trust Account or (ii) vote as a class with our public shares (a) on any initial business combination or (b) to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the time we have to consummate a business combination beyond before June 7, 2024. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote. The issuance of additional ordinary or preference shares:\n\n●| may significantly dilute the equity interest of public shareholders, which dilution would increase if the anti-dilution provisions in the Class B ordinary shares resulted in the issuance of Class A ordinary shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares;  \n---|---  \n●| may subordinate the rights of holders of Class A ordinary shares if preference shares are issued with rights senior to those afforded our Class A ordinary shares;  \n---|---  \n●| could cause a change in control if a substantial number of Class A ordinary shares are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors;  \n---|---  \n●| may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us;  \n---|---  \n●| may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Units, Class A ordinary shares and/or warrants; and  \n---|---  \n●| may not result in adjustment to the exercise price of our warrants.  \n---|---  \n  \n31\n\nUnlike some other similarly structured special purpose acquisition companies, our initial shareholders will receive additional Class A ordinary shares if we issue shares to consummate an initial business combination.\n\nThe founder shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder thereof, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for share subdivisions, share dividends, rights issuances, reorganizations, recapitalizations and other similar transactions, and subject to further adjustment as provided herein. However, if additional Class A ordinary shares or any other equity-linked securities are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts issued in our IPO and related to the closing of our initial business combination, the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all founder shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of (i) the total number of ordinary shares outstanding at our IPO plus (ii) the total number of Class A ordinary shares issued, or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of the initial business combination, excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A ordinary shares issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial business combination and any private placement warrants issued to our sponsor upon conversion of working capital loans, provided that such conversion of Class B ordinary shares will never occur on a less than one-for-one basis. This is different than some other similarly structured special purpose acquisition companies in which the initial shareholders will only be issued an aggregate of 20% of the total number of shares to be outstanding prior to the initial business combination.\n\nResources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may only receive only approximately $10.20 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our Trust Account, and our warrants will expire worthless.\n\nWe anticipate that the investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we decide not to complete a specific initial business combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to complete our initial business combination for any number of reasons including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.20 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless.\n\nAn investment in our securities, and certain subsequent transactions with respect to our securities, may result in uncertain or adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences for an investor.\n\nAn investment in our securities, and certain subsequent transactions with respect to our securities, may result in uncertain U.S. federal income tax consequences for an investor. For instance, because there are no authorities that directly address the U.S. federal income tax implications of instruments similar to our Units, the allocation an investor makes with respect to the purchase price of a unit between the Class A ordinary shares and the one-half of one warrant to purchase one Class A ordinary share included in each unit could be challenged by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or the courts. Furthermore, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of a cashless exercise of warrants is unclear under current law. Finally, it is unclear whether the redemption rights with respect to our Class A ordinary shares suspend the running of a U.S. Holder’s holding period for purposes of determining whether any gain or loss realized by such holder on the sale or exchange of Class A ordinary shares is long-term capital gain or loss and for determining whether any dividend we pay would be considered “qualified dividends” eligible for favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment. See the section of this report captioned “Taxation-United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” for a summary of the U.S. federal income tax considerations of an investment in our securities. Prospective investors are urged to consult with and rely on their tax advisors with respect to these and other tax consequences when purchasing, holding or disposing of our securities.\n\nWe may be a passive foreign investment company, or “PFIC,” which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. investors.\n\nIf we are a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. Holder of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants, the U.S. Holder may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences and may be subject to additional reporting requirements. Our PFIC status for our current and subsequent taxable years may depend on, among other things, whether we qualify for the PFIC start-up exception, the timing of our business combination, the amount of our passive income and assets in the year of the business combination, and the amount of passive income and assets of the acquired business. Our actual PFIC status for our current taxable year or any subsequent taxable year will not be determinable until after the end of such taxable year (and in the case of our start-up year, possibly not until after the close of the second taxable year following our start-up year). Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will not be a PFIC in our current taxable year or in any future taxable year.\n\n32\n\nIf we determine we are a PFIC for any taxable year, upon written request by a U.S. Holder, we will endeavor to provide to a U.S. Holder such information as the IRS may require, including a PFIC annual information statement, in order to enable the U.S. Holder to make and maintain a “qualified electing fund” (“QEF”) election, but there can be no assurance that we will timely provide such required information, and such election would be unavailable with respect to our warrants in all cases. The rules dealing with PFICs and with the QEF election are very complex and are affected by various factors in addition to those described in this report. Accordingly, U.S. investors are strongly urged to consult with and rely solely upon their own tax advisors regarding the application of the PFIC rules to them in their particular circumstances.\n\nWe are subject to changing law and regulations regarding regulatory mailers, corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of non-compliance.\n\nWe are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies, including, for example, the SEC, which are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded, and to new and evolving regulatory measures under applicable law. Our efforts to comply with new and changing laws and regulations have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\n\nMoreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. If we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes, we may be subject to penalty and our business may be harmed.\n\nWe may reincorporate in another jurisdiction in connection with our initial business combination and such reincorporation may result in taxes imposed on shareholders or warrant holders.\n\nWe may, in connection with our initial business combination and subject to requisite shareholder approval under the Companies Act, reincorporate in the jurisdiction in which the target company or business is located or in another jurisdiction. The transaction may require a shareholder or warrant holder to recognize taxable income in the jurisdiction in which the shareholder or warrant holder is a tax resident or in which its members are resident if it is a tax transparent entity. We do not intend to make any cash distributions to shareholders or warrant holder to pay such taxes. Shareholders or warrant holder may be subject to withholding taxes or other taxes with respect to their ownership of us after the reincorporation.\n\nAfter our initial business combination, it is possible that a majority of our directors and officers will live outside the United States and all of our assets will be located outside the United States; therefore, investors may not be able to enforce federal securities laws or their other legal rights.\n\nIt is possible that after our initial business combination, a majority of our directors and officers will reside outside of the United States and all of our assets will be located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult, or in some cases not possible, for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights, to effect service of process upon all of our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties on our directors and officers under United States laws.\n\nWe may issue notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial debt, to complete a business combination, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our shareholders’ investment in us.\n\nAlthough we have no commitments as of the date of this report to issue any notes or other debt securities, or to otherwise incur outstanding debt, we may choose to incur substantial debt to complete our initial business combination. We and our officers have agreed that we will not incur any indebtedness unless we have obtained from the lender a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to the monies held in the Trust Account. As such, no issuance of debt will affect the per share amount available for redemption from the Trust Account. Nevertheless, the incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including:\n\n●| default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;  \n---|---  \n●| acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;  \n---|---  \n●| our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt is payable on demand;  \n---|---  \n  \n33\n\n●| our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt contains covenants restricting  \n---|---  \n●| our ability to obtain such financing while the debt is outstanding;  \n---|---  \n●| our inability to pay dividends on our Class A ordinary shares;  \n---|---  \n●| using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our Class A ordinary shares if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;  \n---|---  \n●| limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;  \n---|---  \n●| increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation or prevailing interest rates; and  \n---|---  \n●| limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe may seek business combination opportunities with a high degree of complexity that require significant operational improvements, which could delay or prevent us from achieving our desired results.\n\nWe may seek business combination opportunities with large, highly complex companies that we believe would benefit from operational improvements. While we intend to implement such improvements, to the extent that our efforts are delayed or we are unable to achieve the desired improvements, the business combination may not be as successful as we anticipate. To the extent we complete our initial business combination with a large complex business or entity with a complex operating structure, we may also be affected by numerous risks inherent in the operations of the business with which we combine, which could delay or prevent us from implementing our strategy. Although our management team will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business and its operations, we may not be able to properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors until we complete our business combination. If we are not able to achieve our desired operational improvements, or the improvements take longer to implement than anticipated, we may not achieve the gains that we anticipate. Furthermore, some of these risks and complexities may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks and complexities will adversely impact a target business. Such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a smaller, less complex organization.\n\nIn order to effectuate an initial business combination, special purpose acquisition companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and other governing instruments, including their warrant agreements. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or governing instruments in a manner that will make it easier for us to complete an initial business combination that some of our shareholders may not support.\n\nIn order to effectuate a business combination, special purpose acquisition companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and governing instruments, including their warrant agreements. For example, special purpose acquisition companies have amended the definition of business combination, increased redemption thresholds and extended the time to consummate an initial business combination and, with respect to their warrants, amended their warrant agreements to require the warrants to be exchanged for cash and/or other securities. Amending our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association requires at least a special resolution of our shareholders as a matter of Cayman Islands law, meaning the approval of holders of at least two- thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company, and amending our warrant agreement in a manner that would adversely impact the registered holders of public warrants will require a vote of holders of at least 50% of the public warrants and, solely with respect to any amendment to the terms of the private placement warrants or any provision of the warrant agreement with respect to the private placement warrants, at least 50% of the then issued and outstanding private placement warrants. In addition, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association require us to provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash if we propose an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (i) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination before June 7, 2024, or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity. To the extent any of such amendments would be deemed to fundamentally change the nature of any of our publicly offered securities, we would register, or seek an exemption from registration for, the affected securities. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or governing instruments or extend the time to consummate an initial business combination in order to effectuate our initial business combination.\n\n34\n\nOur letter agreement with our initial shareholders, officers, directors and Apollo and registration rights agreement may be amended, and provisions therein may be waived, without shareholder approval.\n\nOur letter agreement with our initial shareholders, officers, directors and Apollo contains provisions relating to transfer restrictions of our founder shares and private placement warrants, indemnification of the Trust Account, waiver of redemption rights and participation in liquidating distributions from the Trust Account. The letter agreement and the registration rights agreement may be amended, and provisions therein may be waived, without shareholder approval (although releasing the parties from the restriction contained in the letter agreement not to transfer any Units, warrants, Class A ordinary shares or any other securities convertible into, or exercisable, or exchangeable for, Class A ordinary shares for 180 days following the date of the prospectus for our IPO will require the prior written consent of Needham & Company, LLC). While we do not expect our board to approve any amendment to or waiver of the letter agreement or registration rights agreement prior to our initial business combination, it may be possible that our board, in exercising its business judgment and subject to its fiduciary duties, chooses to approve one or more amendments to or waivers of such agreements. Any such amendments or waivers would not require approval from our shareholders and may have an adverse effect on the value of an investment in our securities.\n\nWe may be unable to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination or to fund the operations and growth of a target business, which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.20 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless.\n\nAlthough we believe that the net proceeds of our IPO and private placements will be sufficient to allow us to complete our initial business combination, we cannot ascertain the capital requirements for any particular transaction because we have not yet selected any prospective target business. If the net proceeds of our IPO and the Private Placements prove to be insufficient, either because of the size of our initial business combination, the depletion of the available net proceeds in search of a target business, the obligation to repurchase for cash a significant number of shares from shareholders who elect redemption in connection with our initial business combination, the sale of the forward purchase securities does not close or the terms of negotiated transactions to purchase shares in connection with our initial business combination, we may be required to seek additional financing or to abandon the proposed business combination. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The current economic environment may make it difficult for companies to obtain acquisition financing. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to complete our initial business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. If we have not consummated our initial business combination within the required time period, our public shareholders may receive only approximately $10.20 per public share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless. In addition, even if we do not need additional financing to complete our initial business combination, we may require such financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of our officers, directors or shareholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination.\n\n35\n\nOur initial shareholders control a substantial interest in us and thus may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support.\n\nAs of March 21, 2024, our initial shareholders, Apollo and members of our management team owned 48.9% of our outstanding ordinary shares. Accordingly, they may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support, including amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. If our initial shareholders purchase any Units or any additional Class A ordinary shares in the aftermarket or in privately negotiated transactions, this would increase their control. Neither our initial shareholders nor, to our knowledge, any of our officers or directors, have any current intention to purchase additional securities. Factors that would be considered in making such additional purchases would include consideration of the current trading price of our Class A ordinary shares. In addition, our board of directors, whose members were appointed by our sponsor, is divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being appointed in each year. We may not hold an annual general meeting to appoint new directors prior to the completion of our initial business combination, in which case all of the current directors will continue in office until at least the completion of the business combination. If there is an annual general meeting, as a consequence of our “staggered” board of directors, only a minority of the board of directors will be considered for appointment and our initial shareholders, because of their ownership position, will have considerable influence regarding the outcome following our initial business combination. In addition, prior to our initial business combination, only holders of our Class B ordinary shares have the right to vote on the appointment of directors, including in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and holders of a majority of our Class B ordinary shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason. As a result, holders of Class A ordinary shares will not have the right to appoint any directors until after the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. Accordingly, our initial shareholders will continue to exert substantial control at least until the completion of our initial business combination.\n\nWe may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders of public warrants with the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants. As a result, the exercise price of your warrants could be increased, the exercise period could be shortened and the number of Class A ordinary shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant could be decreased, all without your approval.\n\nOur warrants were issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder for the purpose of (i) curing any ambiguity or correcting any mistake, including to conform the provisions of the warrant agreement to the description of the terms of the warrants and the warrant agreement set forth in the prospectus for our IPO, or defective provision (ii) amending the provisions relating to cash dividends on ordinary shares as contemplated by and in accordance with the warrant agreement or (iii) adding or changing any provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the warrant agreement as the parties to the warrant agreement may deem necessary or desirable and that the parties deem to not adversely affect the rights of the registered holders of the warrants, provided that the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants is required to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of public warrants. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment and, solely with respect to any amendment to the terms of the private placement warrants or any provision of the warrant agreement with respect to the private placement warrants, at least 50% of the number of the then outstanding private placement warrants. Although our ability to amend the terms of the public warrants with the consent of the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, convert the warrants into cash, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of Class A ordinary shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant.\n\nOur warrant agreement designates the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company.\n\nOur warrant agreement provides that, subject to applicable law, (i) any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the warrant agreement, including under the Securities Act, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and (ii) that we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. We will waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courts represent an inconvenient forum.\n\n36\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions of the warrant agreement will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our warrants shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our warrant agreement. If any action, the subject matter of which is within the scope the forum provisions of the warrant agreement, is filed in a court other than a court of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (a “foreign action”) in the name of any holder of our warrants, such holder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of New York in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an “enforcement action”), and (y) having service of process made upon such warrant holder in any such enforcement action by service upon such warrant holder’s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such warrant holder.\n\nThis choice-of-forum provision may limit a warrant holder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with our company, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our warrant agreement inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors.\n\nWe may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless.\n\nWe have the ability to redeem the outstanding public warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, _provided_ that the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to proper notice of such redemption and _provided_ that certain other conditions are met. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. As a result, we may redeem the warrants as set forth above even if the holders are otherwise unable to exercise the warrants. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you to (i) exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, we expect would be substantially less than the market value of your warrants. None of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by our sponsor, Apollo or their permitted transferees.\n\nIn addition, we have the ability to redeem the outstanding public warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption provided that the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $10.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to proper notice of such redemption and _provided_ that certain other conditions are met, including that holders will be able to exercise their warrants prior to redemption for a number of Class A ordinary shares determined based on the redemption date and the fair market value of our Class A ordinary shares. The value received upon exercise of the warrants (1) may be less than the value the holders would have received if they had exercised their warrants at a later time where the underlying share price is higher and (2) may not compensate the holders for the value of the warrants, including because the number of ordinary shares received is capped at 0.361 Class A ordinary shares per warrant (subject to adjustment) irrespective of the remaining life of the warrants.\n\nNone of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by our sponsor, Apollo or their permitted transferees.\n\nNone of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us on such terms so long as they are held by their initial purchasers or their permitted transferees.\n\n37\n\nOur warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares and make it more difficult to effectuate our initial business combination.\n\nWe have issued warrants to purchase 9,487,500 Class A ordinary shares as part of the Units offered in our IPO and an aggregate of 9,225,000 private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. In addition, if the sponsor makes any working capital loans, it may convert up to $1,500,000 of such loans into up to an additional 1,500,000 warrants, at the price of $1.00 per warrant. We may also issue Class A ordinary shares in connection with our redemption of warrants. To the extent we issue ordinary shares for any reason, including to effectuate a business combination, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional Class A ordinary shares upon exercise of these warrants could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business. Such warrants, when exercised, will increase the number of outstanding Class A ordinary shares and reduce the value of the Class A ordinary shares issued to complete the business transaction. Therefore, our warrants may make it more difficult to effectuate a business transaction or increase the cost of acquiring the target business.\n\nBecause each unit contains one-half of one warrant and only a whole warrant may be exercised, the Units may be worth less than Units of other special purpose acquisition companies.\n\nEach Unit contains one-half of one warrant. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, no fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units, and only whole Units will trade. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number of Class A ordinary shares to be issued to the warrant holder. This is different from other offerings similar to ours whose Units include one ordinary share and one whole warrant to purchase one whole share. We have established the components of the Units in this way in order to reduce the dilutive effect of the warrants upon completion of a business combination since the warrants will be exercisable in the aggregate for one-half of the number of shares compared to Units that each contain a whole warrant to purchase one whole share, thus making us, we believe, a more attractive merger partner for target businesses. Nevertheless, this unit structure may cause our units to be worth less than if a unit included a warrant to purchase one whole share.\n\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\nWe are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to “emerging growth companies” or “smaller reporting companies,” this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\n\nWe are an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Class A ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30th before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\n\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\n\n38\n\nAdditionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year or the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, It may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.\n\nPast performance of our founders and the other members of our management team, including investments and transactions in which they have participated and businesses with which they have been associated, may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us, and we may be unable to provide positive returns to shareholders.\n\nInformation regarding our founders and the other members of our management team, including investments and transactions in which they have participated and businesses with which they have been associated, is presented for informational purposes only. Any past experience and performance of our founders and the other members of our management team and the businesses with which they have been associated, including related to acquisitions and shareholder returns, is not a guarantee that we will be able to successfully identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination, that we will be able to provide positive returns to our shareholders, or of any results with respect to any initial business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical experiences of our founders or the other members of our management team, including investments and transactions in which they have participated and businesses with which they have been associated, as indicative of the future performance of an investment in us, including whether we can provide an attractive return to our shareholders, or as indicative of every prior investment by each of our founders and the other members of our management team. The market price of our securities may be influenced by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, and our shareholders may experience losses on their investment in our securities.\n\nWe are dependent upon our executive officers and directors and their loss could adversely affect our ability to operate.\n\nOur operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals and, in particular, our executive officers and directors. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our officers and directors, at least until we have completed our initial business combination. In addition, our executive officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating their time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. We do not have an employment agreement with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our directors or executive officers. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or executive officers could have a detrimental effect on us.\n\nOur executive officers, directors, security holders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests.\n\nWe have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, executive officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. In fact, we may enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our sponsor, our directors or executive officers, although we do not intend to do so. Nor do we have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours.\n\nThe personal and financial interests of our directors and officers may influence their motivation in timely identifying and selecting a target business and completing a business combination. Consequently, our directors’ and officers’ discretion in identifying and selecting a suitable target business may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether the terms, conditions and timing of a particular business combination are appropriate and in our shareholders’ best interest. If this were the case, it would be a breach of their fiduciary duties to us as a matter of Cayman Islands law and we or our shareholders might have a claim against such individuals for infringing on our shareholders’ rights. However, we might not ultimately be successful in any claim we may make against them for such reason.\n\n39\n\nCompliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may make it more difficult for us to effectuate a business combination, require substantial financial and management resources, and increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition.\n\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2023. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target business with which we seek to complete our initial business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.\n\n**_We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which, if not corrected, could affect the reliability of our consolidated financial statements, and have other adverse consequences._**\n\nAs described in Item 9A: Controls and Procedures included in this Annual Report, we have identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting relating to the accuracy of accounts payable which has yet to be remediated.\n\nA material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If not remediated, these deficiencies could result in material misstatements to our financial statements that could not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\n\nOur management has concluded that this material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting is due to the fact that we did not have the necessary business processes and related internal controls formally designed and implemented and has taken steps to establish and implement such internal controls.\n\nOur management will monitor the effectiveness of our remediation plans and will make changes management determines to be appropriate as described in Item 9A: Controls and Procedures.\n\nIf we identify any new material weaknesses in the future, any such newly identified material weakness could limit our ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of our accounts or disclosures that could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements. In such case, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, and investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and our stock price may decline as a result. Although we have taken steps to maintain our internal control structure as required, including steps to remediate our material weakness, we cannot guarantee that a control deficiency will not result in a misstatement in the future.\n\nBecause we are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, you may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through the U.S. federal courts may be limited.\n\nWe are an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon our directors or executive officers, or enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against our directors or officers.\n\nOur corporate affairs are governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the Companies Act (as the same may be supplemented or amended from time to time) and the common law of the Cayman Islands. We will also be subject to the federal securities laws of the United States. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority, but are not binding on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are different from what they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and certain states, such as Delaware, may have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholders derivative action in a federal court of the United States.\n\nWe have been advised by Maples and Calder (Cayman) LLP, our Cayman Islands legal counsel, that the courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (i) to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state; and (ii) in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of which is, contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy). A Cayman Islands Court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.\n\nAs a result of all of the above, public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a U.S. company.\n\n40\n\nProvisions in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our Class A ordinary shares and could entrench management.\n\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that shareholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include a staggered board of directors, advance notice procedures, inability of shareholders to call a general meeting, removal of directors only for cause (other than by holders of our Class B ordinary shares prior to our initial business combination) and only by the board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preference shares, and the fact that prior to the completion of our initial business combination only holders of our Class B ordinary shares are entitled to vote on the appointment of directors, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\n\nCyber incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\n\nWe depend on digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, including those of third parties with which we may deal. Sophisticated and deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in, our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud, could lead to corruption or misappropriation of our assets, proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. As an early stage company without significant investments in data security protection, we may not be sufficiently protected against such occurrences. We may not have sufficient resources to adequately protect against, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to, cyber incidents. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have adverse consequences on our business and lead to financial loss.\n\nSince only holders of our founder shares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors, upon the listing of our shares on Nasdaq, Nasdaq may consider us to be a “controlled company” within the meaning of Nasdaq rules and, as a result, we may qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\n\nPrior to consummation of our initial business combination, only holders of our founder shares will have the right to vote on the appointment of directors. As a result, Nasdaq may consider us to be a “controlled company” within the meaning of Nasdaq corporate governance standards. Under Nasdaq corporate governance standards, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that:\n\n●| we have a board that includes a majority of “independent directors,” as defined under Nasdaq rules;  \n---|---  \n●| we have a compensation committee of our board that is comprised entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities; and  \n---|---  \n●| we have independent director oversight of our director nominations.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe do not intend to utilize these exemptions and intend to comply with the corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq, subject to applicable phase-in rules. However, if we determine in the future to utilize some or all of these exemptions, you will not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.\n\nIf our management following our initial business combination is unfamiliar with United States securities laws, they may have to expend time and resources becoming familiar with such laws, which could lead to various regulatory issues.\n\nFollowing our initial business combination, our management may resign from their positions as officers or directors of the company and the management of the target business at the time of the business combination will remain in place. Management of the target business may not be familiar with U.S. securities laws. If new management is unfamiliar with U.S. securities laws, they may have to expend time and resources becoming familiar with such laws. This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues which may adversely affect our operations.\n\n41\n\nAfter our initial business combination, substantially all of our assets may be located in a foreign country and substantially all of our revenue may be derived from our operations in any such country. Accordingly, our results of operations and prospects will be subject, to a significant extent, to the economic, political and social conditions and government policies, developments and conditions in the country in which we operate.\n\nThe economic, political and social conditions, as well as government policies, of the country in which our operations are located could affect our business. Economic growth could be uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy and such growth may not be sustained in the future. If in the future such country’s economy experiences a downturn or grows at a slower rate than expected, there may be less demand for spending in certain industries. A decrease in demand for spending in certain industries could materially and adversely affect our ability to find an attractive target business with which to consummate our initial business combination and if we effect our initial business combination, the ability of that target business to become profitable.\n\nExchange rate fluctuations and currency policies may cause a target business’ ability to succeed in the international markets to be diminished.\n\nIn the event we acquire a non-U.S. target, all revenues and income would likely be received in a foreign currency, and the dollar equivalent of our net assets and distributions, if any, could be adversely affected by reductions in the value of the local currency. The value of the currencies in our target regions fluctuate and are affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions. Any change in the relative value of such currency against our reporting currency may affect the attractiveness of any target business or, following consummation of our initial business combination, our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if a currency appreciates in value against the dollar prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, the cost of a target business as measured in dollars will increase, which may make it less likely that we are able to consummate such transaction.\n\nWe may reincorporate in another jurisdiction in connection with our initial business combination, and the laws of such jurisdiction may govern some or all of our future material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights.\n\nIn connection with our initial business combination, we may relocate the home jurisdiction of our business from the Cayman Islands to another jurisdiction. If we determine to do this, the laws of such jurisdiction may govern some or all of our future material agreements. The system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdiction may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the United States. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our future agreements could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities or capital.\n\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\n\nNone.\n\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity.\n\nWe are a Special Purpose Acquisition Company with no business operations. Since our IPO, our sole business activity has been identifying and evaluating suitable acquisition transaction candidates. Therefore, we do not consider that we face significant cybersecurity risk and have not adopted any cybersecurity risk management program or formal processes for assessing cybersecurity risk. Our board of directors is generally responsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats, if there is any. We have not encountered any cybersecurity incidents since our IPO.\n\nItem 2. Properties.\n\nWe do not own or lease any real estate or other physical properties materially important to our operation. We currently maintain our executive offices at 2 Wisconsin Circle, 7th Floor, Chevy Chase, MD 20815. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.\n\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\n\nTo the knowledge of our management, there is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us, any of our officers or directors in their capacity as such or against any of our property.\n\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\n\n**_Not applicable._**\n\n42\n\nPART II\n\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\n\nMarket Information\n\nOur units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants are each traded on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbols “BOCNU,” “BOCN” and “BOCNW,” respectively. Our units commenced public trading on December 3, 2021, and our Class A ordinary shares and warrants commenced separate public trading on January 24, 2022.\n\nHolders\n\nOn March 21, 2024, there was 1 holder of record of our units, 1 holder of record of our Class A ordinary shares, 3 holders of record of our warrants, and 12 holders of record of our founder shares.\n\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans\n\nNone.\n\nDividends\n\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of our initial business combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of our initial business combination and subject to the company having funds lawfully available for distribution under Cayman Islands law. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to our initial business combination is within the discretion of our board of directors at such time and subject to the company having funds lawfully available for distribution under Cayman Islands law. If we incur any indebtedness in connection with a business combination, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.\n\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\n\nOn April 7, 2021, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 4,312,500 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.006 per share. On December 2, 2021, we effected an ordinary share dividend resulting in our sponsor holding an aggregate of 4,503,750 founder shares. The sale of the founder shares was made pursuant to an exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a) (2) of the Securities Act.\n\nOn December 7, 2021, we consummated the Private Placement, with our sponsor and Apollo, of an aggregate of 8,235,000 private placement warrants at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds to us of $8,235,000. On December 7, 2021, a total of $168,300,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement were deposited in the Trust Account. On December 9, 2021, the Underwriter purchased an additional 2,475,000 Units pursuant to the over-allotment option. On December 9, 2021 we consummated the Additional Private Placement with our sponsor and the Underwriter of an aggregate of an additional 990,000 private placement warrants at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrants, generating gross proceeds to us of $990,000. On December 9, 2021, a total of $25,245,000 of the proceeds from the closing of the Over-Allotment Option Units and the Additional Private Placement were deposited into the Trust Account. The private placement warrants are identical to the warrants sold as part of the units in the IPO except that, so long as they are held by our sponsor, Apollo or their permitted transferees: (1) they will not be redeemable by us, except as otherwise set forth in the terms thereof; (2) they (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of these warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the initial purchasers, until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination; (3) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis; and (4) the holders thereof (including with respect to the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of these warrants) are entitled to registration rights. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sale. The sale of the private placement warrants was made pursuant to an exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.\n\n43\n\nUse of Proceeds from the Initial Public Offering\n\nOn December 7, 2021, we consummated our IPO of 16,500,000 Units. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, and the IPO generated gross proceeds of $165,500,000. Needham & Company, LLC. acted as the sale book-running manager of the IPO. The securities sold in the IPO were registered under the Securities Act on a registration statement on Form S-1 (Nos. 333-260889 and 333-261473). The SEC declared the registration statement effective on December 2, 2021. On December 7, 2021, the Underwriter exercised in full the option granted to them by the Company to purchase up to 2,475,000 additional Units solely to cover over-allotments, which option was granted to them under the underwriting agreement for the IPO. The sale of these 2,475,000 additional Units closed on December 9, 2021, generating gross proceeds of $24,750,000.\n\nWe paid a total of $10,436,250 in underwriting fees related to the IPO, of which, the underwriter agreed to defer $6,641,250 until such time as our initial business combination is completed, if at all.\n\nOn December 7, 2021, a total of $168,300,000 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placements were deposited in the Trust Account. On December 9, 2021, a total of $25,245,000 of the proceeds from the closing of the Over-Allotment Option Units and the Additional Private Placement were deposited into the Trust Account, resulting in a total deposit of $193,545,000 in the Trust Account since the Trust Account was established. The net proceeds deposited into the Trust Account remain on deposit in the Trust Account and are available for a business combination, assuming no redemptions, after payment of up to $6,641,250 of deferred underwriting fees, before fees and expenses associated with our initial business combination. The proceeds held in the Trust Account will be invested only in U.S. government securities with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.\n\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\n\nNone.\n\nItem 6.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\n**Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes related thereto which are included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this annual report on Form 10-K. This section of the annual report on Form 10-K discusses activity as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. For discussion on activity for the period from March 26, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021 and period-over-period analysis on results for the year ended December 31, 2022 to the period from March 26, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, refer to, Part II, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and certainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\n\nOverview\n\nWe are a blank check company incorporated on March 26, 2021 as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. We consummated our IPO on December 7, 2021. We did not commence operations until after the closing of the IPO, and as of December 31, 2023, we have not engaged in any significant operations nor generated any operating revenues to date. We will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial business combination.\n\n44\n\nOn December 7, 2021, we completed our IPO of 16,500,000 Units and the Private Placement of an aggregate of 8,235,000 private placement warrants. On December 7, 2021, the Underwriter exercised in full the option granted to them by the Company to purchase up to 2,475,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, and we issued an additional 990,000 private placement warrants in the Additional Private Placement. An aggregate of $193,545,000 in proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placements has been placed in the Trust Account.\n\nOn June 6, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with The News Lens Co., Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company (“TNL”), and TNL Mediagene, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly owned subsidiary of TNL (“Merger Sub”). On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the parties thereto will enter into a business combination transaction pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of TNL (the “Merger”).\n\nOn August 29, 2023, shareholders of the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the “Extraordinary General Meeting”) in lieu of the 2023 annual general meeting of the shareholders of the Company. At the Extraordinary General Meeting, the Company’s shareholders approved the proposal to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to give the Company the right to extend the date by which it has to consummate a business combination from September 7, 2023 to June 7, 2024, by depositing into the Trust Account $60,000 for each of the nine subsequent one-month extensions. In connection therewith the shareholders of record were provided the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights (the “Extension Amendment”). Holders of 12,817,785 shares of Class A ordinary shareholders exercised their right to redemption at a per share redemption price of approximately $10.67. On September 5, 2023, a total of $136,786,445 in redemption payments were made in connection with this redemption. Following the redemption, the Company had a total of 6,157,215 shares of Class A ordinary shares outstanding.\n\nAt the closing of the Transactions (the “Closing”), by virtue of the Merger, the outstanding shares and warrants will be canceled and converted into the right to receive equivalent shares and warrants of TNL, and TNL is expected to be the publicly traded company with its ordinary shares and warrants listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”).\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had cash of approximately $61,977 and $627,628, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 we had a working capital deficit of $4,204,802 and positive working capital of $176,944, as of December 31, 2022. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to complete our initial business combination will be successful.\n\nResults of Operations\n\nWe have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. We will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial Business Combination. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents. There has been no significant change in our financial or trading position and no material adverse change has occurred since the date of our audited financial statements. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we had net income of $4,422,350 which consists of operating expenses of $4,125,912, $15,833 of interest expense, gain on change in fair value of the warrant liability of $1,029,188, interest earned on marketable securities of $6,864,803, and $670,104 of unrealized gain on marketable securities.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we had net income of $12,658,706 which consists of operating expenses of $1,243,831, gain on change in fair value of the warrant liability of $11,226,187, interest earned on marketable securities of $854,167, and $1,822,183 of unrealized gain on marketable securities.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nOn December 7, 2021, we completed our IPO of 16,500,000 Units and the Private Placement of an aggregate of 8,235,000 private placement warrants, generating gross proceeds of $173,235,000.\n\nOn December 9, 2021, the Underwriter exercised in full the option granted to them by the Company to purchase up to 2,475,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, and we issued an additional 990,000 private placement warrants in the Additional Private Placement, generating total gross proceeds of $25,245,000.\n\n45\n\nFollowing our IPO, the exercise of the over-allotment option and the sale of the private placement warrants, a total of $193,545,000 was placed in the Trust Accounts. We incurred $12,517,335 in transaction costs, including $3,795,000 in cash underwriting fees, $6,641,250 of deferred underwriting fees, $1,248,100 of offering costs related to the fair value of the Founder Shares sold to Anchor Investor, and $832,985 of other offering costs.\n\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, cash used in operating activities was $1,555,597. Net income of $4,422,350 was impacted by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $6,864,803, gain on change in fair value of warrant liability of $1,029,188, unrealized gain on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $670,104, interest expense of $15,833 and changes in operating assets and liabilities which used $2,570,315 from operating activities.\n\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, cash used in operating activities was $411,937. Net income of $12,658,706 was impacted by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $854,167, gain on change in fair value of warrant liability of $11,226,187, unrealized gain on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $1,822,183 and changes in operating assets and liabilities which used $831,893 from operating activities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had investments of $67,214,745 and $196,226,283 held in the Trust Accounts, respectively. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Accounts, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less taxes paid and deferred underwriting commissions) to complete our initial Business Combination. We may withdraw interest to pay taxes. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not withdraw any interest earned on the Trust Accounts to pay taxes.\n\nOn August 29, 2023, shareholders of the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders, in connection holders of 12,817,785 shares of Class A ordinary shareholders exercised their right to redemption. On September 5, 2023, a total of $136,786,445 in redemption payments were made in connection with this redemption from the Trust Account. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Accounts will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had cash of $61,977 and $627,628 outside of the Trust Accounts, respectively. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Accounts primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete our initial Business Combination.\n\nIn addition, in order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. Otherwise, such loans may be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination company at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender.\n\nOn June 20, 2023, the Company entered into a Promissory Note (as defined in Note 5) with the Sponsor pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company up to an aggregate principal amount of up to $1,500,000. The Promissory Note is payable on the earlier of the date on which the Company consummates a Business Combination or June 7, 2024. Upon the consummation of the Business Combination, the Sponsor will have the option, but not the obligation, to convert the entire principal balance of the Promissory Note, in whole or in part, into private placement warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The terms of such private placement warrants (if issued) will be identical to the terms of the private placement warrants issued by the Company in connection with the IPO. The Promissory Note is subject to customary events of default, the occurrence of any of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal and interest balance of the Promissory Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Sponsor Note becoming immediately due and payable. As of December 31, 2023 the outstanding principal balance under the Note amounted to an aggregate of $1,080,000.\n\n46\n\nOn August 3, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to TNL with a principal amount equal to $400,000 (the “TNL Working Capital Note”). The TNL Working Capital Note is a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note that will not be repaid in the event that the Merger agreement is terminated prior to the Business Combination. The TNL Working Capital Note will be paid on the date on which the Company consummates the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The following shall constitute an event of default under the TNL Working Capital Note: (i) a failure to pay the principal within five business days of the maturity date and (ii) the commencement of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy action. As of December 31, 2023 the outstanding principal balance under the TNL Working Capital Note amounted to an aggregate of $149,946.\n\nBased on the foregoing, management believes that the Company will have sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity from the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company’s officers and directors to meet its needs through the earlier of the consummation of a Business Combination or one year from this filing. Over this time period, the Company will be using these funds for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination.\n\nIn connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with the authoritative guidance in FASB ASU 2014-15, “Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.” The Company has until June 7, 2024, to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by the specified period. If a Business Combination is not consummated by June 7, 2024 and the Company decides not to extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution.\n\nThe Company’s evaluation of its liquidity condition and the date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern one year from the date that these financial statements are issued. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements; Commitments and Contractual Obligations\n\nOn December 31, 2023, we did not have any obligations, assets or liabilities that would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations.\n\nContractual Obligations\n\nAdministrative Support Agreement\n\nOn December 2, 2021, the Company entered into an Administrative Support Agreement pursuant to which the Company may reimburse an affiliate of the Sponsor up to an amount of $10,000 per month for office space and secretarial and administrative support. The Company considered this agreement under the guidance of ASC 842, Leases, and determined that this agreement did not meet the definitions of a lease.\n\nRegistration Rights\n\nThe holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and any warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans (and in each case holders of their component securities, as applicable) are entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement effective December 2, 2021, which requires the Company to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to our Class A ordinary shares). The holders of the majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the consummation of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\n\n47\n\nUnderwriter’s Agreement\n\nThe Company paid a cash underwriting discount of 2.00% of the gross proceeds of the IPO, or $3,795,000 due to the exercise of the over-allotment option in full. In addition, the underwriter will be entitled to a deferred fee of three and a half percent (3.50%) of the gross proceeds of the IPO, or $6,641,250. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. The underwriter has reimbursed the Company for $550,000 for offering expenses. The reimbursement of these costs has been accounted for as a reduction to offering costs of the Public Offering.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThis management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to fair value of financial instruments and accrued expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company has identified the following as its critical accounting policies:\n\nWarrant Liabilities\n\nThe Company accounts for the Warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the specific terms of the Warrants and the applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480, “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity” (“ASC 480”), and ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether they are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the Warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common shares and whether the holders of the Warrants could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of issuance of the Warrants and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the Warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, such warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, such warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of liability-classified warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations.\n\nClass A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption\n\nClass A ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Class A ordinary shares (including Class A ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Class A ordinary shares is classified as shareholders’ equity. Our Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 6,157,215 and 18,975,000 shares, respectively, of Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders’ deficit section of the Company’s balance sheet.\n\nNet Income Per Ordinary Share\n\nBasic income per ordinary share is computed by dividing net income applicable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Consistent with ASC 480, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption, as well as their pro rata share of undistributed trust earnings consistent with the two-class method, have been excluded from the calculation of income per ordinary share for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of trust earnings. Diluted income per share includes the incremental number of ordinary shares to be issued to settle warrants, as calculated using the treasury method. For the period from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any dilutive warrants, securities or other contracts that could potentially, be exercised or converted into ordinary shares. As a result, diluted income per ordinary share is the same as basic income per ordinary share for all periods presented.\n\n48\n\nPromissory Note\n\nUpon issuance, we separately account for the liability and equity components of the Promissory Note by estimating the fair values of the i) liability component without a conversion feature and ii) the conversion feature. This results in a bifurcation of a component of the debt, classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in our consolidated statements of income unless the amount is determined to be de minimis. Upon settlement of the Promissory Note instruments, we allocate the total consideration between the liability and equity components based on the fair value of the liability component without the conversion feature. If applicable, the difference between the consideration allocated to the liability component and the net carrying value of the liability component is recognized as an extinguishment loss or gain. The remaining settlement consideration is allocated to the equity component and recognized as a reduction of additional paid-in capital in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\n\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (“ASU 2020-06”) to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity’s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. As a smaller reporting company, ASU 2020-06 is effective January 1, 2024 and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, that ASU 2020-06 would have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.\n\nJOBS Act\n\nOn April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected to irrevocably opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we will adopt the new or revised standard at the time public companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another emerging growth company that has not opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.\n\nAdditionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an “emerging growth company”, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO’s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our IPO or until we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” whichever is earlier.\n\n49\n\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\n\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item.\n\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n\nReference is made to Pages F-1 through F-15 comprising a portion of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\n\nNone.\n\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2023.\n\nDisclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nManagement’s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\n\nOur Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n●| pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our company,  \n---|---  \n●| provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and  \n---|---  \n●| provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements  \n---|---  \n  \n50\n\nIn making these assessments, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2023, due to the material weakness in management’s review of the completeness and accuracy of accounts payable related to the identification and estimation of period end accruals.\n\nA material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of its financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If not remediated, these deficiencies could result in material misstatements to our financial statements that could not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\n\nOur management has concluded that this material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting is due to the fact that we did not have the necessary business processes and related internal controls formally designed and implemented. As a result, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, management believes that the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the period presented.\n\n**_Remediation Activities_**\n\nIn order to address the identified material weakness, our management has instituted enhanced controls including review processes and reconciliations related to accrued expenses and accounts payable. Our management intends to remediate these deficiencies as soon as possible and believes these actions will be sufficient to address the identified material weaknesses and strengthen the Company’s internal control over financial reporting; however, there can be no guarantee that such remediation will be sufficient. Our management will continue to monitor the effectiveness of its controls and will make any further changes management determines appropriate. We do not anticipate the hiring of additional finance and accounting personnel and the implementation of improvements to our accounting systems and controls are unlikely to be costly and time consuming.\n\nIf not remediated, this identified material weakness could result in material misstatements to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that might not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, or in delayed filing of required periodic reports.\n\nThis Report does not include an attestation report of internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm due to our status as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act.\n\n**_Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting_**\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nItem 9B.

Our board of directors is divided into three classes, with only one class of directors being appointed in each year, and with each class (except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual general meeting) serving a three-year term. In accordance with Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual general meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on Nasdaq. The term of office of the first class of directors, consisting of Norman Pearlstine and Sean Glodek, was extended at the EGM in August 2023. The term of office of the second class of directors, consisting of Priscilla Han, Joel Motley and Matt Goldberg, will expire at our second annual general meeting. The term of office of the third class of director, consisting of Marcus Brauchli, will expire at our third annual general meeting.\n\nPrior to the completion of an initial business combination, any vacancy on the board of directors may be filled by a nominee chosen by holders of a majority of our founder shares. In addition, prior to the completion of an initial business combination, holders of a majority of our founder shares may remove a member of the board of directors for any reason.\n\nOur officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of directors are authorized to appoint persons to the offices as set forth in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association as it deems appropriate. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that our officers may consist of one or more chairmen of the board, chief executive officers, a president, chief financial officer, vice presidents, secretary, treasurer and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors.\n\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\n\nOur board of directors has two standing committees: an audit committee and a compensation committee. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, Nasdaq rules and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors, and Nasdaq rules require that the compensation committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. Each committee operates under a charter that was approved by our board of directors and has the composition and responsibilities described below.\n\n_Audit Committee_\n\nWe have established a separately-designated standing audit committee of the board of directors. Joel Motley, Matt Goldberg and Priscilla Han serve as members of our audit committee. Under Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have three members of the audit committee, all of whom must be independent. Joel Motley, Matt Goldberg and Priscilla Han are independent.\n\nJoel Motley serves as the Chairman of the audit committee. Each member of the audit committee is financially literate, and our board of directors has determined that Joel Motley qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” as defined in applicable SEC rules. The primary purposes of our audit committee are to assist the board’s oversight of:\n\n●| the integrity of our financial statements;  \n---|---  \n●| our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;  \n---|---  \n●| the qualifications, engagement, compensation, independence and performance of our independent registered public accounting firm;  \n---|---  \n●| our process relating to risk management and the conduct and systems of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures; and  \n---|---  \n●| the performance of our internal audit function.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe audit committee is governed by a charter that complies with Nasdaq rules.\n\n56\n\n _Compensation Committee_\n\nWe have established a compensation committee of our board of directors. The members of our compensation committee are Matt Goldberg and Priscilla Han, with Matt Goldberg serving as chairman of the compensation committee. Matt Goldberg and Priscilla Han are independent for purposes of Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules.\n\nThe primary purposes of our compensation committee are to assist the board in overseeing our management compensation policies and practices, including:\n\n●| determining and approving the compensation of our executive officers; and  \n---|---  \n●| reviewing and approving incentive compensation and equity compensation policies and programs.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe charter also provides that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC.\n\nThe compensation committee is governed by a charter that complies with Nasdaq rules.\n\n_Director Nominations_\n\nWe do not have a standing nominating committee though we intend to form a corporate governance and nominating committee as and when required to do so by law or Nasdaq rules. In accordance with Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq rules, a majority of the independent directors may recommend a director nominee for selection by the board of directors. The board of directors believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily carry out the responsibility of properly selecting or approving director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee. The directors who participate in the consideration and recommendation of director nominees are Norman Pearlstine, Joel Motley, Matt Goldberg and Priscilla Han. In accordance with Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq rules, all such directors are independent. As there is no standing nominating committee, we do not have a nominating committee charter in place.\n\nWe have not formally established any specific minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, our board of directors considers educational background, diversity of professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom and the ability to represent the best interests of our shareholders.\n\n_Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation_\n\nNone of our executive officers currently serves, and in the past year has not served, as a member of the compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our board of directors.\n\nCode of Ethics\n\nWe have adopted a code of ethics and business conduct applicable to our directors, officers and employees.\n\nAvailability of Documents\n\nWe have filed a copy of our Code of Ethics, our audit committee charter and our compensation committee charter as exhibits to the registration statement relating to our IPO and they are referred to in the exhibit index of this report. You will be able to review these documents by accessing our public filings at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. In addition, a copy of these documents will be provided without charge upon request from us. We intend to disclose any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our Code of Ethics in a Current Report on Form 8-K. Please see “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”\n\n57\n\nItem 11. Executive Compensation.\n\nExecutive Officer and Director Compensation\n\nNone of our executive officers or directors has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us, other than Messrs. Leggett and Lasov who receive fees pursuant to separate consulting agreements with the Company as described below; provided that our sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating, negotiating and completing an initial business combination.\n\nPursuant to a consulting agreement entered into by the Company and Mr. Leggett on October 11, 2022, as amended July 31, 2023 (the “Leggett Consulting Agreement”), Mr. Leggett is entitled to $20,000 per month for certain services Mr. Leggett provides to the Company and its affiliates. Mr. Leggett is further entitled to a success bonus of $250,000 to be paid within 10 business days of the close of the business combination, subject to adjustment as described in the Leggett Consulting Agreement. Pursuant to a consulting agreement entered into by the Company and Mr. Lasov on November 22, 2022, as amended July 31, 2023 (the “Lasov Consulting Agreement”), Mr. Lasov is entitled to $32,500 per month for certain services Mr. Lasov provides to the Company and its affiliates. Mr. Lasov is further entitled to a success bonus of $150,000 to be paid within 10 business days of the close of the business combination, subject to adjustment as described in the Lasov Consulting Agreement.\n\nIn the future, we, upon consultation with the compensation committee of our board of directors, may decide to compensate our executive officers and other employees. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or our or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial business combination will be made using funds held outside the Trust Account. We do not expect to have any additional controls in place governing our reimbursement payments to our directors and executive officers for their out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating, negotiating and completing an initial business combination other than the audit committee’s quarterly review of such payments. Other than these payments, reimbursements and the consulting fees described above, no compensation of any kind, including finder’s fees, will be paid by the Company to our sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, prior to completion of our initial business combination.\n\nAfter the completion of our initial business combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting or management fees from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to shareholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation materials or tender offer materials furnished to our shareholders in connection with a proposed business combination. We have not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our directors or members of management. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed business combination, because the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining executive officer and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our executive officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors.\n\nWe do not intend to take any action to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the consummation of our initial business combination, although it is possible that some or all of our executive officers and directors may remain in their positions or negotiate employment or consulting arrangements to remain with us in the same or a different capacity after our initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements may influence our management’s motivation in identifying or selecting a target business but we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after the consummation of our initial business combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business combination. We are not party to any agreements with our executive officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment.\n\nItem 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Shareholder Matters.\n\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our ordinary shares as of March 21, 2024, based on\n\n●| information obtained from the persons named below, with respect to the beneficial ownership of our ordinary shares by:  \n---|---  \n  \n58\n\n●| each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our issued outstanding ordinary shares;  \n---|---  \n●| each of our executive officers and directors; and  \n---|---  \n●| all our executive officers and directors as a group.  \n---|---  \n  \nUnless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all of our ordinary shares beneficially owned by them.

Each of Marcus Brauchli and Richard Leggett are the managers of Blue Ocean Sponsor LLC. As such, each of Marcus Brauchli and Richard Leggett may be deemed to have beneficial ownership of the Class B ordinary shares held directly by Blue Ocean Sponsor LLC. Each of Marcus Brauchli and Paul Bascobert disclaim beneficial ownership over any securities owned by our sponsor in which he does not have any pecuniary interest.  \n---|---  \n(5)| Does not include any shares indirectly owned by this individual as a result of his or her partnership interest in our sponsor or its affiliates.  \n---|---  \n(6)| Interests shown consist of Class A ordinary shares.  \n---|---  \n(7)| Based upon its Schedule 13G/A filed February 13, 2024 with the SEC with respect to Class A ordinary shares, which will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares concurrently with or immediately following the initial business combination, held as of December 31, 2023, Apollo has shared voting and dispositive power as to 858,817 Class B ordinary shares and each of (i) Apollo Credit Strategies Master Fund Ltd. (“Credit Strategies”), (ii) Apollo ST Fund Management LLC (“ST Management”), (iii) Apollo ST Operating LP (“ST Operating”), (iv) Apollo ST Capital LLC (“ST Capital”), (v) ST Management Holdings, LLC (“ST Management Holdings”), (vi) Apollo Capital Management, L.P. (“Capital Management”); (vii) Apollo Capital Management GP, LLC (“Capital Management GP”); (viii) Apollo Management Holdings, L.P. (“Management Holdings”); and (ix) Apollo Management Holdings GP, LLC (“Management Holdings GP”), also have shared voting and dispositive power as to 858,817 Class B ordinary shares held by Apollo. ST Management serves as the investment manager for Credit Strategies. ST Operating is the sole member of ST Management. The general partner of ST Operating is ST Capital.

Capital Management GP serves as the general partner of Capital Management. Management Holdings serves as the sole member and manager of Capital Management GP, and Management Holdings GP serves as the general partner of Management Holdings. Each of the entities except Credit Strategies disclaims beneficial ownership of all securities.  \n---|---  \n  \n59\n\nOur initial shareholders, Apollo and members of our management team beneficially own approximately 48.9% of the outstanding ordinary shares and will have the right to appoint all of our directors prior to our initial business combination. Holders of our public shares do not have the right to appoint any directors to our board of directors prior to our initial business combination. Because of this ownership block, our initial shareholders, Apollo and members of our management team may be able to effectively influence the outcome of all other matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and approval of significant corporate transactions including our initial business combination.\n\nOur sponsor and Apollo have purchased an aggregate of 9,225,000 private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, at a price of $1.00 per warrant ($9,225,000 in aggregate), in private placements that closed substantially concurrent with the closing of our IPO (including the over-allotment). As of March 30, 2023, our sponsor holds 9,125,000 private placement warrants and Apollo holds 100,000 private placement warrants. If we do not complete our initial business combination before June 7, 2024, the private placement warrants will expire worthless. The private placement warrants are subject to the transfer restrictions described below. The private placement warrants will not be redeemable by us so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. Our sponsor, Apollo or their permitted transferees, have the option to exercise the private placement warrants on a cashless basis. If the private placement warrants are held by holders other than initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the units sold in our IPO. Otherwise, the private placement warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants sold in our IPO.\n\nIn the event that our sponsor deems it necessary in order to facilitate our initial business combination for the sponsor to forfeit, transfer, exchange or amend the terms of all or any portion of the private placement warrants or to enter into any other arrangements with respect to the private placement warrants (including, without limitation, a transfer of the sponsor’s membership interests representing an interest in the private placement warrants) to facilitate the consummation of such business combination, such change shall apply pro rata to Apollo and our sponsor based on the relative number of private placement warrants held by each. By way of example, in the event 50% of the sponsor’s private placement warrants are forfeited or transferred by the sponsor as part of such business combination, Apollo shall forfeit or transfer 50% of its private placement warrants on substantially the same terms and conditions as the sponsor, in which case the reduction shall equal 50% of the private placement warrants held by Apollo at such time.\n\nOur sponsor, and our officers and directors are deemed to be our “promoters” as such term is defined under the federal securities laws.\n\nTransfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants\n\nThe founder shares, private placement warrants and any Class A ordinary shares issued upon conversion or exercise thereof are each subject to transfer restrictions pursuant to lock-up provisions in the letter agreement entered into by our initial shareholders, directors, officers and Apollo. Pursuant to such letter agreement, our initial shareholders, directors, officers and Apollo have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell (i) any of their founder shares until the earlier to occur of: (a) one year after the completion of our initial business combination; and (b) subsequent to our initial business combination (x) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property or (y) if the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and other similar transactions) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination and (ii) any of their private placement warrants and the respective Class A ordinary shares underlying such warrants until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. The foregoing restrictions are not applicable to transfers (a) to our officers or directors, any affiliates or family members of any of our officers or directors, any members of our sponsor or their affiliates, or any affiliates of our sponsor or of Apollo, (b) in the case of an individual, by gift to a member of one of the individual’s immediate family or to a trust, the beneficiary of that is a member of the individual’s immediate family, an affiliate of such person or to a charitable organization, (c) in the case of an individual, by virtue of laws of descent and distribution upon death of the individual, (d) in the case of an individual, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, (e) by private sales or transfers made in connection with any forward purchase agreement or similar arrangement or in connection with the consummation of a business combination at prices no greater than the price at which the applicable securities were originally purchased, (f) by virtue of the laws of the Cayman Islands or the limited liability company agreement of our sponsor upon dissolution of the sponsor, (g) in the event of the company’s liquidation prior to the completion of a business combination, (h) to the company for no value for cancellation in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, or (i) in the event of our completion of a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property subsequent to our completion of our initial business combination; provided, however, that in the case of clauses (a) through (f) these permitted transferees must enter into a written agreement agreeing to be bound by these transfer restrictions and the other restrictions contained in the letter agreements.\n\n60\n\nRegistration Rights\n\nThe holders of the founder shares, private placement warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans (and any Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the private placement warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our completion of our initial business combination. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\n\nItem 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\n\nOn April 7, 2021, we issued to our sponsor an aggregate of 4,312,500 founder shares in exchange for a payment of $25,000 from our sponsor to cover certain expenses on behalf of us, or approximately $0.006 per share. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by the sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The per share price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash the sponsor paid for the founder shares by the number of founder shares issued. Our sponsor transferred 30,000 founder shares to each of Joel Motley, Matt Goldberg, and Priscilla Han, and 25,000 founder shares to each of Norman Pearlstine and Dale Mathias, our independent directors, at the same price originally paid for such shares. Dale Mathias transferred her founder shares back to our sponsor upon her leaving the board of directors. In addition, our sponsor transferred an aggregate of 100,000 founder shares to six advisors at the same price as originally paid for such shares. Our sponsor also surrendered 618,750 founder shares to us for no consideration due to the underwriter’s exercise of the over-allotment option. The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder thereof, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment. On December 2, 2021, we effected an ordinary share dividend resulting in our sponsor receiving an additional 191,250 founders shares, in order to maintain the number of founder shares, on an as-converted basis, at 20% of the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares outstanding at such time.\n\nOur sponsor and Apollo purchased an aggregate of 9,225,000 private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one ordinary share at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, at a price of $1.00 per warrant ($9,225,000 in the aggregate), in a private placement that closed substantially concurrent with our IPO. Our sponsor purchased 9,125,000 private placement warrants and Apollo purchased 100,000 private placement warrants. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder to purchase one ordinary share at $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The private placement warrants (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor.\n\nIn the event that our sponsor deems it necessary in order to facilitate our initial business combination for the sponsor to forfeit, transfer, exchange or amend the terms of all or any portion of the private placement warrants or to enter into any other arrangements with respect to the private placement warrants (including, without limitation, a transfer of the sponsor’s membership interests representing an interest in the private placement warrants) to facilitate the consummation of such business combination, such change shall apply pro rata to Apollo and our sponsor based on the relative number of private placement warrants held by each. By way of example, in the event 50% of the sponsor’s private placement warrants are forfeited or transferred by the sponsor as part of such business combination, Apollo shall forfeit or transfer 50% of its private placement warrants on substantially the same terms and conditions as the sponsor, in which case the reduction shall equal 50% of the private placement warrants held by Apollo at such time.\n\n61\n\nIf any of our founders, officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he, she or it has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, then, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, he, she or it will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity.\n\nOther than these fees, no compensation of any kind, including finder’s and consulting fees, will be paid by the company to our sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the completion of an initial business combination. However, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating, negotiating and completing an initial business combination. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made by us to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates.\n\nWe agreed to pay an affiliate of our sponsor $10,000 per month for office space, administrative and support services, and are accruing that obligation.\n\nIn order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required on a non-interest basis. If we complete our initial business combination, we may repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds held in the Trust Account released to us. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. Except as set forth above, the terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our Trust Account.\n\nAfter our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our shareholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, furnished to our shareholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a general meeting held to consider our initial business combination, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation.\n\nAt the closing of our initial business combination, we will issue and sell an additional 125,000 founder shares to Apollo subject to a reduction in ownership (as described below). The purchase price for the founder shares in each case will be $0.0058 per share and our sponsor will automatically forfeit to the company for cancellation, for $0.0058 per share, a number of founder shares equal to the number of founder shares purchased by Apollo. However, if Apollo does not enter into a binding commitment to purchase an amount of Class A ordinary shares with a value of at least $25,000,000 (or equivalent securities of the target of the business combination or the successor registrant of the Company) in a private placement financing that will close concurrently with the closing of the initial business combination, the number of founder shares that Apollo will be entitled to purchase at the closing of our initial business combination will be reduced up to 125,000 founder shares on a pro rata basis. Additionally, if immediately following the closing of the initial business combination, (i) Apollo owns less than 100% but more than 50% of the 9.99% of the Class A ordinary shares sold in our IPO, then Apollo will forfeit its right to purchase up to 50,000 founder shares on a pro rata basis, or (ii) Apollo owns less than 50% of the 9.99% of the Class A ordinary shares sold in our IPO, then Apollo will forfeit its right to purchase up to 75,000 founder shares in addition to the forfeiture of 50,000 founder shares pursuant to (i) on a pro rata basis. In the event our sponsor deems it necessary in order to facilitate an initial business combination for the sponsor to forfeit, transfer, exchange or amend the terms of all or any portion of the founder shares or to enter into any other arrangements with respect to the founder shares (including, without limitation, a transfer of the sponsor’s membership interests representing an interest in any of the foregoing), such change in investment will apply pro rata to Apollo and our sponsor based on the relative number of founder shares to be held by each, and, accordingly, Apollo will forfeit its right to purchase up to 125,000 founder shares as necessary to facilitate the foregoing. In the event that a reduction of ownership in Apollo’s founder shares exceeds the 125,000 additional founder shares eligible for purchase by Apollo, effective on the closing of an initial business combination, Apollo will forfeit to us, for reissuance to our sponsor, an amount of its additional founder shares previously purchased equal to such excess, provided that Apollo will not be required to forfeit more than 125,000 of the additional founder shares purchased (such that Apollo will in all circumstances be allowed to retain at least 50,000 founder shares).\n\n62\n\nWe have agreed to reissue to our sponsor, at a price of $0.0058 per share, a number of founder shares equal to any founder shares or rights to purchase founder shares forfeited by Apollo.\n\nIn the event that Apollo votes its public shares in favor of our initial business combination, a smaller portion of affirmative votes from other public shareholders would be required to approve our initial business combination. However, because Apollo is not obligated to continue owning any public shares, we cannot assure you that Apollo will be a shareholder at the time of our initial business combination.\n\nIn addition, the units (including the underlying public shares and warrants) Apollo may purchase will not be subject to any agreements restricting their transfer.\n\nRefer to Note 5 of our financial statements for more information regarding our related party transactions.\n\nPolicy for Approval of Related Party Transactions\n\nThe audit committee of our board of directors will adopt a charter, providing for the review, approval and/or ratification of “related party transactions,” which are those transactions required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K as promulgated by the SEC, by the audit committee. At its meetings, the audit committee shall be provided with the details of each new, existing, or proposed related party transaction, including the terms of the transaction, any contractual restrictions that the company has already committed to, the business purpose of the transaction, and the benefits of the transaction to the company and to the relevant related party. Any member of the committee who has an interest in the related party transaction under review by the committee shall abstain from voting on the approval of the related party transaction, but may, if so requested by the chairman of the committee, participate in some or all of the committee’s discussions of the related party transaction. Upon completion of its review of the related party transaction, the committee may determine to permit or to prohibit the related party transaction.\n\nManagement will present to the audit committee each proposed related party transaction, including all relevant facts and circumstances relating thereto. Under the policy, we may consummate related party transactions only if our audit committee approves or ratifies the transaction in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the policy. The policy will not permit any director or executive officer to participate in the discussion of, or decision concerning, a related person transaction in which he or she is the related party.\n\nDirector Independence\n\nNasdaq listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors be independent. An “independent director” is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the company’s board of directors, would interfere with the director’s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our board of directors has determined that Norman Pearlstine, Joel Motley, Matt Goldberg and Priscilla Han are “independent directors” as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.\n\n63\n\nItem 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services.\n\nThe following is a summary of fees paid or to be paid to Marcum LLP, or Marcum, for services rendered in 2022 and 2023:\n\nType of Fee | Year Ended December 31, 2023 | Year Ended December 31, 2022  \n---|---|---  \nAudit Fees | 91,110 | 88,942  \nAudit-Related Fees | - | -  \nTax Fees | - | -  \nAll Other Fees | 12,875 | -  \n  \nPre-Approval Policy\n\nOur audit committee was formed upon the consummation of our IPO. As a result, the audit committee did not pre-approve all of the foregoing services, although any services rendered prior to the formation of our audit committee were approved by our board of directors. Since the formation of our audit committee, and on a going-forward basis, the audit committee has and will pre-approve all auditing services and permitted non-audit services to be performed for us by our auditors, including the fees and terms thereof (subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in the Exchange Act which are approved by the audit committee prior to the completion of the audit).\n\n64\n\nPART IV\n\nItem 15.

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related statements of operations, changes in shareholders’ deficit and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n**Explanatory Paragraph – Going Concern**\n\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company is a Special Purpose Acquisition Corporation that was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities on or before June 7, 2024 by depositing into the Trust Account a specified amount for each of the one-month extensions through June 7, 2024. The Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger with a business combination target on June 6, 2023; however, the completion of this transaction is subject to the approval of the Company’s stockholders among other conditions. There is no assurance that the Company will obtain the necessary approvals, satisfy the required closing conditions, or raise the additional capital it needs to fund further business operations prior to June 7, 2024, if at all. The Company also has no approved plan in place to extend the business combination deadline and fund operations for any period of time after June 7, 2024 in the event that it is unable to complete a business combination by that date. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans with regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\n\n**Basis for Opinion**\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n/s/ Marcum llp\n\nMarcum llp\n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021.\n\nNew York, NY\n\nMarch 21, 2024\n\nF-2\n\nBLUE OCEAN ACQUISITION CORP.\n\nBALANCE SHEETs\n\nDecember 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \n**Assets**  \nCurrent Assets:  \nCash | $| 61,977 | $| 627,628  \nPrepaid expenses and other assets | 66,214 | 236,042  \nTotal current assets | 128,191 | 863,670  \nNon-current assets  \nCash held in trust account | 67,214,745 | 196,226,283  \nTotal assets | $| 67,342,936 | $| 197,089,953  \nLiabilities, Redeemable Ordinary Shares and Shareholders’ Deficit  \nCurrent Liabilities:  \nAccounts payable and accrued expenses | $| 2,857,214 | $| 576,727  \nAccounts Payable -

DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS\n\nBlue Ocean Acquisition Corp (the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on March 26, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”). The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had not yet commenced any operations. All activity for the period March 26, 2021 (inception), through December 31, 2023, relates to the Company’s formation and the initial public offering (the “Public Offering”) which is described below. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Public Offering. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end.\n\nThe registration statement for the Company’s Public Offering was declared effective on December 6, 2021 (the “Effective Date”). On December 7, 2021, the Company consummated the Public Offering of 16,500,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the shares of Class A ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the “Public Shares”), generating gross proceeds of $165,000,000 which is described in Note 3. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company (the “Public Shares”) and one-half of one redeemable warrant (the “Public Warrants”). On December 9, 2021, the underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option and purchased 2,475,000 units (the “Over-Allotment Option Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Over-Allotment Option Unit, generating gross proceeds of $24,750,000.\n\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 8,235,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant that closed in a private placement to Blue Ocean Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”) and Apollo SPAC Fund I, L.P. (“Apollo” or “Anchor Investor”) simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering (see Note 4). On December 9, 2021, the Company consummated the sale of additional 990,000 Private Placement Warrants (the “Additional Private Placement Warrants”) with the Sponsor at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of $990,000.\n\nTransaction costs amounted to $12,517,335, consisting of $3,795,000 in cash underwriting fees, $6,641,250 of deferred underwriting fees, $1,248,100 of offering costs related to the fair value of the Founder Shares sold to Anchor Investor, and $832,985 of other offering costs.\n\nFollowing the closing of the Public Offering, the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, the sale of the Over-Allotment Option Units and the sale of the Additional Private Placement Shares, an amount of $193,545,000 ($10.20 per Public Unit) was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”), located in the United States and will be invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds held in the Trust Account, as described below.\n\nOn August 29, 2023, shareholders of the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the “Extraordinary General Meeting”) in lieu of the 2023 annual general meeting of the shareholders of the Company. At the Extraordinary General Meeting, the Company’s shareholders approved the proposal to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to give the Company the right to extend the date by which it has to consummate a business combination from September 7, 2023 to June 7, 2024, by depositing into the Trust Account $60,000 for each of the nine subsequent one-month extensions. In connection therewith the shareholders of record were provided the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights (the “Extension Amendment”). Holders of 12,817,785 shares of Class A ordinary shareholders exercised their right to redemption at a per share redemption price of approximately $10.67. On September 5, 2023, a total of $136,786,445 in redemption payments were made in connection with this redemption. Following the redemption, the Company had a total of 6,157,215 shares of Class A ordinary shares outstanding.\n\nF-7\n\nThe Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. NASDAQ rules provide that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (as defined below) (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing a definitive agreement to enter a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. Upon the closing of the Public Offering, management has agreed that $10.20 per Unit sold in the Public Offering, including the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, will be held in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) and may or may not be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company’s shareholders, as described below.\n\nThe Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the “public shareholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. In connection with a proposed Business Combination, the Company may seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against a Business Combination. The Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks shareholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that, a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to 15% or more of the Public Shares without the Company’s prior written consent.\n\nThe public shareholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially $10.20 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The per-share amount to be distributed to shareholders who redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriter (as discussed in Note 7). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company’s warrants. These shares of Class A ordinary shares are recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.”\n\nIf a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Memorandum and Articles of Association, offer such redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination.\n\nThe Company’s Sponsor and Apollo have agreed (a) to vote their Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination, (b) not to propose an amendment to the Company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association with respect to the Company’s pre-Business Combination activities prior to the consummation of a Business Combination unless the Company provides dissenting public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment; (c) not to redeem any shares (including the Founder Shares) into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a Business Combination (or to sell any shares in a tender offer in connection with a Business Combination if the Company does not seek shareholder approval in connection therewith) or a vote to amend the provisions of the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association relating to shareholders’ rights of pre-Business Combination activity and (d) that the Founder Shares shall not participate in any liquidating distributions upon winding up if a Business Combination is not consummated. However, the Sponsor and Apollo will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares purchased during or after the Public Offering if the Company fails to complete its Business Combination.\n\nF-8\n\nIf the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Company’s board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company, subject in each case to its obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law.\n\nThe underwriter has agreed to waive its rights to the deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).\n\nThe Sponsor and Apollo have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to the Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants it will receive if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor, Apollo or any of their respective affiliates acquire Public Shares, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, and in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).\n\nIn order to protect the amounts held in the trust, the Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.20 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the day of liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.20 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriter of Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and believe that the Sponsor’s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot assure its shareholders that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of the Company’s officers or directors will indemnify the Company for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.\n\nBusiness Combination\n\nOn June 6, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with The News Lens Co., Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company (“TNL”), and TNL Mediagene, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly owned subsidiary of TNL (“Merger Sub”). On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the parties thereto will enter into a business combination transaction pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of TNL (the “Merger”).\n\nF-9\n\nAt the closing of the Transactions (the “Closing”), by virtue of the Merger, the outstanding shares and warrants will be canceled and converted into the right to receive equivalent shares and warrants of TNL, and TNL is expected to be the publicly traded company with its ordinary shares and warrants listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”).\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $61,977, and $627,628 in its operating bank account, respectively. At December 31, 2023 the Company had working capital deficit of $4,204,802, and positive working capital of $176,944 as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe Company’s liquidity needs to date have been satisfied through a payment of $25,000 from the Sponsor to purchase the Founder Shares, the loan from the Sponsor under the Note (as defined in Note 5), and the proceeds from the consummation of the Private Placement not held in the Trust Account of $2.2 million. The Company repaid the Note in full on December 6, 2021. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company Working Capital Loans (as defined in Note 5). As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were no amounts outstanding under any Working Capital Loans.\n\nAdditionally, on June 20, 2023, the Company entered into a Promissory Note (as defined in Note 5) with the Sponsor pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company up to an aggregate principal amount of up to $1,500,000. The Promissory Note is payable on the earlier of the date on which the Company consummates a Business Combination or June 7, 2024. Upon the consummation of the Business Combination, the Sponsor will have the option, but not the obligation, to convert the entire principal balance of the Promissory Note, in whole or in part, into private placement warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The terms of such private placement warrants (if issued) will be identical to the terms of the private placement warrants issued by the Company in connection with the IPO. The Promissory Note is subject to customary events of default, the occurrence of any of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal and interest balance of the Promissory Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Sponsor Note becoming immediately due and payable. As of December 31, 2023 the outstanding principal balance under the Note amounted to an aggregate of $1,080,000.\n\nOn August 3, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to TNL with a principal amount equal to $400,000 (the “TNL Working Capital Note”). The TNL Working Capital Note is a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note that will not be repaid in the event that the Merger agreement is terminated prior to the Business Combination. The TNL Working Capital Note will be paid on the date on which the Company consummates the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The TNL Working Capital Notes is subject to events of default, the occurrence of any of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal and interest balance of the Promissory Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Sponsor Note becoming immediately due and payable. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal balance under the Note amounted to an aggregate of $149,946.\n\nBased on the foregoing, management believes that the Company will have insufficient working capital and borrowing capacity from the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company’s officers and directors to meet its needs through the earlier of the consummation of a Business Combination or one year from this filing. Over this time period, the Company will be using these funds for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination.\n\nIn connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with the authoritative guidance in FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-15, “Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.” The Company has until June 7, 2024, to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by that specified period. If a Business Combination is not consummated by June 7, 2024, and the Company decides not to extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution.\n\nThe Company’s evaluation of its liquidity condition and the date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern one year from the date that these financial statements are issued. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\n\nF-10\n\nRisks and Uncertainties\n\nManagement is currently evaluating the impact of the rising interest rates, inflation due to the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict between Israel and Palestine on the industry and has concluded the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IR Act”) was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a U.S. federal 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. Because the Company may acquire a domestic corporation or engage in a transaction in which a domestic corporation becomes our parent or our affiliate and our securities trade on US stock exchange, the Company may become a “covered corporation” within the meaning of the IR Act. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax.\n\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying financial statements are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results and cash flows for the periods presented.\n\nEmerging Growth Company\n\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\n\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company, which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\n\nF-11\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\n\nConcentration of Credit Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Coverage of $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on this account and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account.\n\nCash Held in Trust Account\n\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, substantially all the assets held in the Trust Account were held in money market funds, which primarily invest in U.S. Treasury securities. On December 1, 2023, the substantially all of the assets held in the Trust Account were deposited into an interest-bearing demand deposit account.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company had $61,977 and $627,628 in cash held in its operating account as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\n\nASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position.\n\nThere is currently no taxation imposed on income by the Government of the Cayman Islands. In accordance with Cayman income tax regulations, income taxes are not levied on the Company. Consequently, income taxes are not reflected in the Company’s financial statements. The Company’s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.\n\nThe Company may be subject to potential examination by federal and state taxing authorities in the areas of income taxes. These potential examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal and state tax laws. The Company has completed a nexus study and believes that it is appropriately filing tax returns in which it has nexus.\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” (“ASC 820”) approximates the carrying amounts represented in the balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature.\n\nF-12\n\nFair Value Measurements\n\nThe Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually.\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities).\n\nThe following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities:\n\nLevel 1: | Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.  \n---|---  \nLevel 2: | Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.  \nLevel 3: | Unobservable inputs based on our assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  \n  \nIn some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”). Derivative instruments are initially recorded at fair value on the grant date and re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statement of operations. Derivative assets and liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\n\nWarrant Liabilities\n\nThe Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815. The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own ordinary shares, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.\n\nFor issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations.\n\nThe Company evaluated the Public Warrants (as defined in Note 7) and the Private Placement Warrants (collectively, the “Warrants”) in accordance with ASC 815, and concluded that a provision in the warrant agreement, dated December 2, 2021 (the “Warrant Agreement”) related to certain tender or exchange offers precludes the Warrants from being accounted for as components of equity. As the Warrants meet the definition of a derivative as contemplated in ASC 815, the Warrants are recorded as derivative liabilities on the condensed balance sheets and measured at fair value at inception (on the date of the IPO) and at each reporting date in accordance with ASC 820 with changes in fair value recognized in the condensed statement of operations in the period of change.\n\nF-13\n\nOffering Costs Associated with the Public Offering\n\nThe Company complies with the requirements of ASC 340-10-S99-1, SEC Staff Accounting bulletin Topic 5A - “Expenses of Offering”, and SEC Staff Accounting bulletin Topic 5T - “Accounting for Expenses or Liabilities Paid by Principal Stockholder(s)”. Offering costs consist principally of professional and registration fees incurred through the balance sheet date that are related to the IPO. Offering costs directly attributable to the issuance of an equity contract to be classified in equity are recorded as a reduction of equity. Offering costs for equity contracts that are classified as assets and liabilities are expensed immediately. The Company incurred offering costs amounting to $12,517,335 as a result of the IPO (consisting of $3,795,000 of underwriting fees, $6,641,250 of deferred underwriting fees, $1,248,100 for the excess fair value of Founder Shares attributable to the Anchor Investor, and $832,985 of other offering costs). The Company recorded $10,788,729 of offering costs as a reduction of equity in connection with the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units. The Company immediately expensed $480,506 of offering costs in connection with the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants that were classified as liabilities.\n\nClass A Shares Subject to Possible Redemption\n\nThe Company accounts for its Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC 480. Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption are classified as a liability instrument and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders’ equity. The Company’s Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption is presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders’ deficit section of the Company’s balance sheet.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the amount of Class A ordinary shares reflected on the balance sheet are reconciled in the following table:\n\n**Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption as of December 31, 2021** | $| 193,545,000  \n---|---|---  \nPlus:  \nAdjust carrying value to redemption value | 2,681,283  \nClass A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption as of December 31, 2022 | $| 196,226,283  \nPlus:  \nAdjust carrying value to redemption value | 7,774,907  \nLess:  \nShares redeemed in September 2023 | (136,786,445| )  \nClass A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption as of December 31, 2023 | $| 67,214,745  \n  \nNet Income Per Ordinary Share\n\nBasic income per ordinary share is computed by dividing net income applicable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Consistent with FASB 480, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption, as well as their pro rata share of undistributed trust earnings consistent with the two-class method, have been excluded from the calculation of income per ordinary share for the year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of trust earnings. Diluted income per share includes the incremental number of ordinary shares to be issued to settle warrants, as calculated using the treasury method. For the year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any dilutive warrants, securities or other contracts that could potentially, be exercised or converted into ordinary shares. As a result, diluted income per ordinary share is the same as basic income per ordinary share for all periods presented.\n\nF-14\n\nA reconciliation of net income per ordinary share is as follows:\n\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 | For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \nClass A | Class B | Class A | Class B  \nEPS  \nNumerator: Net Income  \nAllocation of net income | $| 3,352,565 | $| 1,069,785 | $| 10,126,965 | $| 2,531,741  \nDenominator: Weighted Average share  \nBasic and diluted weighted average ordinary shares outstanding | 14,866,285 | 4,743,750 | 18,975,000 | 4,743,750  \nBasic and diluted net income per ordinary share | $| 0.23 | $| 0.23 | $| 0.53 | $| 0.53  \n  \nStock Compensation Expense\n\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”). Under ASC 718, stock-based compensation associated with equity-classified awards is measured at fair value upon the grant date and recognized over the requisite service period. To the extent a stock-based award is subject to a performance condition, the amount of expense recorded in a given period, if any, reflects an assessment of the probability of achieving such performance condition, with compensation recognized once the event is deemed probable to occur. Forfeitures are recognized as incurred. The Company has recognized no stock-based compensation expense during the period from inception to December 31, 2023.\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\n\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (“ASU 2020-06”) to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity’s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. As a smaller reporting company, ASU 2020-06 is effective January 1, 2024 and should be applied on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted beginning on January 1, 2021.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. ASU 2023-09 requires additional quantitative and qualitative income tax disclosures to enable financial statements users better assess how an entity’s operations and related tax risks and tax planning and operational opportunities affect its tax rate and prospects for future cash flows. For public business entities, ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, which will be fiscal 2025 for us. The Company expects the adoption to result in disclosure changes only.\n\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.\n\nNOTE 3. PUBLIC OFFERING\n\nPursuant to the Public Offering, the Company sold 16,500,000 Units at $10.00 per Unit. On December 9, 2021, the underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option and purchased 2,475,000 Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $24,750,000. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, $0.0001 par value, and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“Public Warrant”). Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share (see Note 7).\n\nF-15\n\nAn Anchor Investor unaffiliated with any member of our management team purchased an aggregate of 1,895,602 of the Units sold in the Public Offering. These Units purchased by Apollo in this offering are not be subject to any agreements restricting their transfer. Further, Apollo purchased 175,000 founder shares at $0.0058 per share.\n\nThe Company considers the excess fair value of the Founder Shares issued to the Anchor Investor above the purchase price as offering costs and will reduce the gross proceeds by this amount. The Company has valued the excess fair value over consideration of the founder shares offered to the Anchor Investor at $1,248,100. The excess of the fair value over consideration of the Founder Shares was determined to be an offering cost in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A and 5T and were allocated to shareholders’ equity and expenses upon the completion of the Public Offering.\n\nNOTE 4. PRIVATE PLACEMENT\n\nSimultaneously with the closing of Public Offering, the Sponsor and Anchor Investor have agreed to purchase an aggregate of 8,235,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. On December 9, 2021, the Company consummated the sale of additional 990,000 Private Placement Warrants with the Sponsor at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of $990,000.\n\nEach Private Placement Warrant is identical to the warrants offered in the Public Offering, except there is no redemption rights or liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to Private Placement Warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company does not consummate a Business Combination within the Combination Period. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants were added to the net proceeds from the Public Offering held in the Trust Account.\n\nNOTE 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\n\nFounder Shares\n\nOn March 26, 2021, the Company issued an aggregate of 4,312,500 shares of Class B ordinary shares (the “Founder Shares”) to the Sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. On December 2, 2021, the Company effected a share capitalization of an additional 431,250 Class B ordinary shares, resulting in an aggregate of 4,743,750 Class B ordinary shares outstanding. All share and per-share amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect the share capitalization. The Founder Shares include an aggregate of up to 618,750 shares subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor to the extent that the underwriter’s overallotment is not exercised in full or in part, so that the Sponsor will collectively own, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares after the Public Offering. \n\nThe Sponsor and Anchor Investor have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of its Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) one year after the completion of a Business Combination or (B) subsequent to our initial business combination (x) if the last reported sale price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, share dividends, rights issuances, consolidations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and other similar transactions) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination or (y) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of our public shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property.\n\nAnchor Investor has not been granted any shareholder or other rights in addition to those afforded to the Company’s other public shareholders. Further, Anchor Investor is not required to (i) hold any Units, Class A ordinary shares or warrants purchased in the Public Offering or thereafter for any amount of time, (ii) vote any Class A ordinary shares they may own at the applicable time in favor of the Business Combination or (iii) refrain from exercising their right to redeem their public shares at the time of the Business Combination. Anchor Investor has the same rights to the funds held in the Trust Account with respect to the Class A ordinary shares underlying the Units they purchased in the Public Offering as the rights afforded to the Company’s other public shareholders.\n\nF-16\n\nPromissory Note-Related Party\n\nOn June 20, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the “Note”) to the Sponsor for borrowings from time to time of up to an aggregate of $1,500,000 which may be drawn by the Company to finance costs incurred in connection with a potential initial business combination and for working capital purposes and/or to finance monthly deposits into the Trust Account for each public share that is not redeemed in connection with the extension of the Company’s termination date from September 7, 2023 to June 7, 2024. The Note is interest bearing and is payable on the earlier of (i) June 7, 2024; (ii) the date on which the Company consummates a Business Combination or (iii) the Company liquidates the Trust Account upon the failure to consummate an initial business combination within the requisite time period. Upon consummation of the Company’s initial business combination, the Note may be converted, at the Sponsor’s discretion, into private placement warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. As of December 31, 2023 the outstanding principal balance under the Note amounted to an aggregate of $1,080,000.\n\nRelated Party Loans\n\nIn order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Company’s Sponsor, an affiliate of the Sponsor, or the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (the “Working Capital Loans”). Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of notes may be converted upon consummation of a Business Combination into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. There are no Working Capital Loans outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\nAdministrative Support Agreement\n\nOn December 2, 2021, the Company entered into an Administrative Support Agreement pursuant to which the Company’s initial business combination or liquidation, the Company may reimburse an affiliate of the Sponsor up to an amount of $10,000 per month for office space and secretarial and administrative support. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there have been $120,000 and $110,000 and in charges, respectively, related to this agreement, $10,000 of which have been reimbursed.\n\n**Consulting Agreements**\n\nThe Company and Mr. Leggett entered into a consulting agreement on October 11, 2022, as amended July 31, 2023 (the “Leggett Consulting Agreement”). Mr. Leggett is entitled to $20,000 per month for certain services Mr. Leggett provides to the Company and its affiliates. Mr. Leggett is further entitled to a success bonus of $250,000 to be paid within 10 business days of the close of the business combination, subject to adjustment as described in the Leggett Consulting Agreement. The Company and Mr. Lasov entered into a consulting agreement on November 22, 2022, as amended July 31, 2023 (the “Lasov Consulting Agreement”). Mr. Lasov is entitled to $32,500 per month for certain services Mr. Lasov provides to the Company and its affiliates. Mr. Lasov is further entitled to a success bonus of $150,000 to be paid within 10 business days of the close of the business combination, subject to adjustment as described in the Lasov Consulting Agreement.\n\nNOTE 6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\nRegistration Rights\n\nThe holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and any warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans (and in each case holders of their component securities, as applicable) are entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement effective December 2, 2021, which requires the Company to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to our Class A ordinary shares). The holders of the majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the consummation of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\n\nUnderwriter’s Agreement\n\nThe Company paid a cash underwriting discount of 2.00% of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering, or $3,795,000 due to the exercise of the over-allotment option in full. In addition, the underwriter will be entitled to a deferred fee of three and a half percent (3.50%) of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering, or $6,641,250. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. The underwriter has reimbursed the Company for $550,000 for offering expenses. The reimbursement of these costs has been accounted for as a reduction to offering costs of the Public Offering.\n\nF-17\n\nNOTE 7. WARRANTS\n\nThe Company accounted for the 18,712,500 warrants issued in connection with the Public Offering (the 9,487,500 Public Warrants and the 9,225,000 Private Placement Warrants) in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40. Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each warrant much be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, the Company has classified each warrant as a liability at its fair value. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the Company’s statement of operations.\n\n**_Warrants_ - **Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants will become exercisable 30 days after the consummation of a Business Combination. The Public Warrants will expire five years from the consummation of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.\n\nThe Company will not be obligated to deliver any Class A ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a Public Warrant and will have no obligation to settle such Public Warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration. No Public Warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their Public Warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available.\n\nThe Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days, after the closing of a Business Combination, it will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement registering the issuance, under the Securities Act, of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the shares of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants, to cause such registration statement to become effective and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the shares of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th business day after the closing of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption.\n\n**_Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $ 18.00. _**Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the Warrants for redemption:\n\n●| in whole and not in part;  \n---|---  \n●| at a price of $0.01 per Public Warrant;  \n---|---  \n●| upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder and  \n---|---  \n●| if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company will not redeem the warrants as described above unless an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares is available throughout the 30-day redemption period. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, the Company may exercise its redemption right even if the Company is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.\n\nF-18\n\n** _Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $ 10.00. _**Once the Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the Warrants for redemption:\n\n●| in whole and not in part;  \n---|---  \n●| at $0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption provided that holders will be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares determined by reference to the table based on the redemption date and the “fair market value” of our Class A ordinary shares;  \n---|---  \n●| if, and only if, the Reference Value (as defined above under “Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $18.00”) equals or exceeds $10.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant); and  \n---|---  \n●| if the Reference Value is less than $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant), the private placement warrants must also concurrently be called for redemption on the same terms as the outstanding public warrants, as described above.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf and when the Public Warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may not exercise its redemption right if the issuance of shares of ordinary shares upon exercise of the warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or the Company is unable to effect such registration or qualification.\n\nThe exercise price and number of shares of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Public Warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless. If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless.\n\nIn addition, if (x) the Company issues additional shares of Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of its initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of Class A ordinary shares (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company’s board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the Sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the “Newly Issued Price”), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the Company’s initial Business Combination on the date of the consummation of such initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price and the $18.00 per share redemption trigger price described above will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the greater of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.\n\nThe Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants included in the Units sold in the Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants are and the shares of ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants are not transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis and are non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.\n\nF-19\n\nNOTE 8. SHAREHOLDERS’ DEFICIT\n\n**_Preferred Shares_** -The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value preferred shares. On December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022 there were no preferred shares issued or outstanding.\n\n**_Class A Ordinary shares_** -The Company is authorized to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of Class A, $0.0001 par value ordinary shares. Holders of the Company’s ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share.\n\n**_Class B Ordinary shares_** -The Company is authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of Class B, $0.0001 par value ordinary shares. Holders of the Company’s ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share. On December 2, 2021, the Company effected a share capitalization of an additional 431,250 Class B ordinary shares, resulting in an aggregate of 4,743,750 Class B ordinary shares outstanding. All share and per-share amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect the share capitalization.\n\nHolders of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all other matters submitted to a vote of shareholders, except as required by law; provided that only holders of Class B ordinary shares have the right to vote for the election of directors prior to the Company’s initial Business Combination.\n\nThe shares of Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of our initial business combination, or earlier at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for share sub-divisions, share dividends, rights issuances, consolidations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like, and subject to further adjustment as provided herein. In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts issued in this offering and related to the closing of our initial business combination, the ratio at which the Class B ordinary shares will convert into Class A ordinary shares will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding Class B ordinary shares agree to waive such anti-dilution adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Class B ordinary shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of all ordinary shares issued and outstanding upon the completion of this offering plus all Class A ordinary shares and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with our initial business combination, excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in our initial business combination. The term “equity-linked securities” refers to any debt or equity securities that are convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for our Class A ordinary shares issued in a financing transaction in connection with our initial business combination, including but not limited to a private placement of equity or debt.\n\nPursuant to and concurrently with the Public Offering, the Company sold 18,975,000 Units. In connection with Extraordinary General Meeting, the shareholders of record were provided the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights. Holders of 12,817,785 shares of Class A ordinary shareholders exercised their right to redemption. Following the redemption, the Company had a total of 6,157,215 shares of Class A ordinary shares outstanding.\n\nAt December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were no Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding, excluding 6,157,215 and 18,975,000 Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption and 4,743,750 Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding.\n\nF-20\n\nNOTE 9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n\nThe following table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis on December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value:\n\n**December 31, 2023** | **Quoted Prices In Active Markets (Level 1)** | Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) | Significant Other Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  \n---|---|---|---  \nAssets:  \nCash held in Trust Account | $| 67,214,745 | $| 67,214,745 | $| - | $| -  \nLiabilities:  \nWarrant liabilities - Public Warrants | $| 189,750 | $| - | $| 189,750 | $| -  \nWarrant liabilities - Private Placement Warrants | $| 184,500 | $| - | $| - | $| 184,500  \nDecember 31, 2022 | Quoted Prices In Active Markets (Level 1) | Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) | Significant Other Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  \n---|---|---|---  \nAssets:  \nMarketable securities held in Trust Account | $| 196,226,283 | $| 196,226,283 | $| - | $| -  \nLiabilities:  \nWarrant liabilities - Public Warrants | $| 711,563 | $| - | $| 711,563 | $| -  \nWarrant liabilities - Private Placement Warrants | $| 691,875 | $| - | $| - | $| 691,875  \n  \nThe Warrants are accounted for as liabilities in accordance with ASC 815 and are presented within warrant liabilities on the balance sheets. The warrant liabilities are measured at fair value at inception and on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented within change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the statements of operations. Transfers to/from Levels 1, 2 and 3 are recognized at the beginning of the reporting period in which a change in valuation technique or methodology occurs.\n\nThe Company established the initial fair value for the warrant liabilities on December 7, 2021, the date of the Company’s Public Offering, using a Binomial Lattice-based model for the Public Warrants, and a Black-Scholes option pricing model for the Private Placement Warrants. The Private Placement Warrants and Public Warrants were classified as Level 3 at the initial measurement date due to the use of unobservable inputs. The estimated fair value of Public Warrants was transferred from a Level 3 measurement to a Level 1 measurement when the Public Warrants were separately listed and traded in an active market in January 2022.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of Public Warrants was transferred from a Level 1 measurement to a Level 2 measurement when the Public Warrants were considered to no longer have an active market.\n\nThe Private Placement Warrants were valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is considered to be a Level 3 fair value measurement. The key inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the Private Placement Warrants were as follows as of December 31, 2023:\n\nDecember 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \nInput  \nRisk-free interest rate | - | -  \nExpected term (years) | 4.78 | 5.20  \nExpected volatility | - | -  \nExercise price | $| 11.50 | $| 11.50  \nFair value of Class A ordinary shares | $| 10.78 | $| 10.28  \n  \nThe Company’s use of both models required the use of subjective assumptions:\n\n●| The risk-free interest rate assumption was based on the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rate for the expected term of the warrants.  \n---|---  \n  \nF-21\n\n●| The expected term was determined utilizing a probability weighted term input to be consistent with the stock price and volatility inputs which are reflective of the probability of successful merger.  \n---|---  \n●| The expected volatility assumption was based on the implied volatility solved by calibrating the warrant value output from a Binomial Lattice based model to the publicly observed, traded price on each valuation date. An increase in the expected volatility, in isolation, would result in an increase in the fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities and vice versa.  \n---|---  \n●| The fair value of one Class A ordinary share is inferred by solving to the publicly-traded stock price.  \n---|---  \n  \nBased on the applied volatility assumption and the expected term to a business combination noted above, the Company determined that the risk-neutral probability of exceeding the $18.00 redemption value by the start of the exercise period resulted in a nominal difference in value between the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants across the valuation dates utilized in the Binomial Lattice-based model. Therefore, the resulting valuations for the Private Placement Warrants and Public Warrants were determined to be within $0.01.\n\nThe following table presents the changes in the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments that are measured at fair value:\n\nFair value as of January 1, 2022 | $| 12,629,625  \n---|---|---  \nTransfer of Public Warrants to Level 3 measurement | (6,356,625| )  \nChange in fair value | (3,228,750| )  \nFair value as of March 31, 2022 | $| 3,044,250  \nChange in fair value | (1,845,000| )  \nFair value as of June 30, 2022 | $| 1,199,250  \nChange in fair value | (184,500| )  \nFair value as of September 30, 2022 | $| 1,014,750  \nChange in fair value | (322,875| )  \nFair value as of December 31, 2022 | $| 691,875  \nChange in fair value | 139,298  \nFair value as of March 31, 2023 | $| 831,173  \nChange in fair value | (433,575| )  \nFair value as of June 30, 2023 | $| 397,598  \nChange in fair value | 119,925  \nFair value as of September 30, 2023 | $| 517,523  \nChange in fair value | (333,023| )  \nFair value as of December 31, 2023 | $| 184,500  \n  \nNOTE 10. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\nManagement of the Company evaluated events that have occurred after the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were issued. Based upon this review, management did not identify any recognized or non-recognized subsequent events, other than below, that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.\n\nIn accordance with the Extension Amendment on January 2, 2024 and February 2, 2024 and March 1, 2024 the Company deposited $60,000 into the Trust Account in order to effect the additional one-month extensions, which has extended the deadline to April 7, 2024 to consummate the Business Combination.\n\nOn January 8, 2024 and February 6, 2024 the Company made additional draws of $100,000 and $110,000, respectively, on the Working Capital Promissory Note. On January 8, 2024 and February 16, 2024 the Company made additional draws of $49,980 on the TNL Working Capital Note. The funds will be used to finance working capital needs and to fund the required extension payments into the trust account.\n\nF-22\n\nSIGNATURES\n\nPursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d)

DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS**\n\nBlue Ocean Acquisition Corp (the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on March 26, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”). The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.\n\nOn June 6, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with The News Lens Co., Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company (“TNL”), and TNL Mediagene, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly owned subsidiary of TNL (“Merger Sub”). On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the parties thereto will enter into a business combination transaction pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of TNL (the “Merger”).\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company had not yet commenced any operations. All activity through March 31, 2024, relates to the Company’s formation and the initial public offering (the “Public Offering”) which is described below, and subsequent to the Public Offering, identifying a target for a Business Combination, including the negotiation of the Merger Agreement. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end.\n\nThe registration statement for the Company’s Public Offering was declared effective on December 6, 2021 (the “Effective Date”). On December 7, 2021, the Company consummated the Public Offering of 16,500,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the shares of Class A ordinary shares included in the Units offered, the “Public Shares”), generating gross proceeds of $165,000,000 which is described in Note 3. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company and one-half of one redeemable warrant (the “Public Warrants”). On December 9, 2021, the underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option and purchased 2,475,000 units (the “Over-Allotment Option Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Over-Allotment Option Unit, generating gross proceeds of $24,750,000.\n\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 8,235,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant that closed in a private placement to Blue Ocean Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”) and Apollo SPAC Fund I, L.P. (“Apollo” or “Anchor Investor”) simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering (see Note 4). On December 9, 2021, the Company consummated the sale of additional 990,000 Private Placement Warrants (the “Additional Private Placement Warrants”) with the Sponsor at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of $990,000.\n\nTransaction costs amounted to $12,517,335, consisting of $3,795,000 in cash underwriting fees, $6,641,250 of deferred underwriting fees, $1,248,100 of offering costs related to the fair value of the Founder Shares sold to Anchor Investor, and $832,985 of other offering costs. \n\nFollowing the closing of the Public Offering, the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, the sale of the Over-Allotment Option Units and the sale of the Additional Private Placement Shares, an amount of $193,545,000 ($10.20 per Public Unit) was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”), located in the United States and until November 2023, was invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in a money market fund meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, which invests only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds held in the Trust Account, as described below.\n\n5\n\nOn August 29, 2023, shareholders of the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the “Extraordinary General Meeting”) in lieu of the 2023 annual general meeting of the shareholders of the Company. At the Extraordinary General Meeting, the Company’s shareholders approved the proposal to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to give the Company the right to extend the date by which it has to consummate a business combination from September 7, 2023 to June 7, 2024, by depositing into the Trust Account $60,000 for each of the nine subsequent one-month extensions. In connection therewith the shareholders of record were provided the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights (the “Extension Amendment”). Holders of 12,817,785 shares of Class A ordinary shareholders exercised their right to redemption at a per share redemption price of approximately $10.67. On September 5, 2023, a total of $136,786,445 in redemption payments were made in connection with this redemption. Following the redemption, the Company had a total of 6,157,215 shares of Class A ordinary shares outstanding.\n\nOn January 24, 2024, the SEC issued final rules (the “SPAC Rules”) relating to, among other things, disclosures in business combination transactions between special purpose acquisition companies (“SPACs”) such as us and private operating companies; the condensed financial statement requirements applicable to transactions involving shell companies; and the use of projections by SPACs in SEC filings in connection with proposed business combination transactions. In connection with the issuance of the SPAC Rules, the SEC also issued guidance (the “SPAC Guidance”) regarding the potential liability of certain participants in proposed business combination transactions and the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“Investment Company Act”) based on certain facts and circumstances such as duration, asset composition, sources of income, business purpose and activities of the SPAC and its management team in furtherance of such goals.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of us being deemed to be an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act) and thus subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, in November 2023, the Company instructed Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the trustee with respect to the Trust Account, to liquidate the U.S. government treasury obligations or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter deposited the cash from the liquidation of the trust assets into an interest-bearing demand deposit account until the earlier of the consummation of the initial Business Combination or the Company’s liquidation, with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company continuing to act as trustee. As a result, following such liquidation, we would receive minimal interest, if any, on the funds held in the trust account, which would reduce the dollar amount our public shareholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company.\n\nThe Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. NASDAQ rules provide that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing a definitive agreement to enter a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination.\n\nThe Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the “public shareholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. In connection with a proposed Business Combination, the Company may seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against a Business Combination. Subject to the condition of the Merger Agreement, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the TNL has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately after the Effective Time, as determined by the Merger Agreement, upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks shareholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination.\n\n6\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that, a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to 15% or more of the Public Shares without the Company’s prior written consent.\n\nThe public shareholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially $10.20 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The per-share amount to be distributed to shareholders who redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriter (as discussed in Note 7). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company’s warrants. These shares of Class A ordinary shares are recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity” (“ASC 480”).\n\nIf a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Memorandum and Articles of Association, offer such redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination.\n\nThe Company’s Sponsor and Apollo have agreed (a) to vote their Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination, (b) not to propose an amendment to the Company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association with respect to the Company’s pre-Business Combination activities prior to the consummation of a Business Combination unless the Company provides dissenting Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment; (c) not to redeem any shares (including the Founder Shares) into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a Business Combination (or to sell any shares in a tender offer in connection with a Business Combination if the Company does not seek shareholder approval in connection therewith) or a vote to amend the provisions of the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association relating to shareholders’ rights of pre-Business Combination activity; and (d) that the Founder Shares shall not participate in any liquidating distributions upon winding up if a Business Combination is not consummated. However, the Sponsor and Apollo will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares purchased during or after the Public Offering if the Company fails to complete its Business Combination.\n\nIf the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Company’s board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company, subject in each case to its obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law.\n\nThe underwriter has agreed to waive its rights to the deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).\n\n7\n\nThe Sponsor and Apollo have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to the Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants it will receive if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor, Apollo or any of their respective affiliates acquire Public Shares, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, and in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).\n\nIn order to protect the amounts held in the trust, the Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.20 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the day of liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.20 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriter of Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and believe that the Sponsor’s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot assure its shareholders that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of the Company’s officers or directors will indemnify the Company for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.\n\n**Business Combination**\n\nOn June 6, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with The News Lens Co., Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company (“TNL”), and TNL Mediagene, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly owned subsidiary of TNL (“Merger Sub”). On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the parties thereto will enter into a business combination transaction pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of TNL (the “Merger”).\n\nAt the closing of the Transactions (the “Closing”), by virtue of the Merger, the outstanding shares and warrants will be canceled and converted into the right to receive equivalent shares and warrants of TNL, and TNL is expected to be the publicly traded company with its ordinary shares and warrants listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”).\n\nThe Merger Agreement and related agreements are further described in the Form 8-K filed by the Company on June 6, 2023.\n\n**Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern**\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $38,609 and $61,977 in its operating bank account, respectively, and working capital deficiency of approximately $5,372,722 as of March 31, 2024.\n\n8\n\nThe Company’s liquidity needs to date have been satisfied through a payment of $25,000 from the Sponsor to purchase the Founder Shares, the loan from the Sponsor under the Note (as defined in Note 4), and the proceeds from the consummation of the Private Placement not held in the Trust Account of $2.2 million. The Company repaid the Note in full on December 6, 2021. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company Working Capital Loans (as defined in Note 5). As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no amounts outstanding under any Working Capital Loans.\n\nOn June 20, 2023, the Company entered into a Promissory Note (as defined in Note 5) with the Sponsor pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company up to an aggregate principal amount of up to $1,500,000. The Promissory Note is payable on the earlier of the date on which the Company consummates a Business Combination or June 7, 2024. Upon the consummation of the Business Combination, the Sponsor will have the option, but not the obligation, to convert the entire principal balance of the Promissory Note, in whole or in part, into private placement warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The terms of such private placement warrants (if issued) will be identical to the terms of the private placement warrants issued by the Company in connection with the IPO. The Promissory Note is subject to customary events of default, the occurrence of any of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal and interest balance of the Promissory Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Sponsor Note becoming immediately due and payable. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal balance under the Note amounted to an aggregate of $1,410,000 and 1,080,000, respectively.\n\nOn August 3, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to TNL with a principal amount equal to $400,000 (the “TNL Working Capital Note”). The TNL Working Capital Note is a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note that will not be repaid in the event that the Merger agreement is terminated prior to the Business Combination. The TNL Working Capital Note will be paid on the date on which the Company consummates the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The TNL Working Capital Notes is subject to events of default, the occurrence of any of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal and interest balance of the Promissory Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Sponsor Note becoming immediately due and payable. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal balance under the Note amounted to an aggregate of $249,906 and $149,946, respectively.\n\nOn April 5, 2024, the Company entered into a promissory note with the Sponsor pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company a principal amount equal to $750,000 (the “Sponsor Promissory Note”). The Sponsor Promissory Note is a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note which may be drawn down by the Company from time to time to be used for costs and expenses related to the Company’s initial merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company and one or more businesses or entities. Pursuant to the terms of the Sponsor Promissory Note, if the Business Combination is not consummated, the Sponsor Promissory Note will be repaid solely to the extent that the Company has funds available to it outside of its Trust Account, and that all other amounts will be contributed to capital, forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven or eliminated. The Sponsor Promissory Note is subject to events of default, the occurrence of any of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal of the Sponsor Promissory Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Sponsor Note becoming immediately due and payable. As of March 31, 2024, there was no amount outstanding balance under the Sponsor Promissory Note.\n\nIn accordance with the Extension Amendment, on January 2, 2024, February 2, 2024, March 1, 2024, April 1, 2024 and May 1, 2024, the Company deposited $60,000 into the Trust Account in order to effect additional one month extensions, which extended the deadline to June 7, 2024 to consummate the Business Combination.\n\nOver this time period, the Company will be using these funds for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination.\n\n9\n\nIn connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with the authoritative guidance in FASB Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-15, “Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.” The Company has until June 7, 2024, to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by the specified period. If a Business Combination is not consummated by June 7, 2024, and the Company decides not to extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution.\n\nThe Company’s evaluation of its liquidity condition and the date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern one year from the date that these condensed financial statements are issued. These condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\n\n**Risks and Uncertainties**\n\nManagement is currently evaluating the impact of rising interest rates, inflation, the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in Israel and Palestine on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that any of these could have a negative effect on the Company’s financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these unaudited condensed financial statements. The unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\n**Inflation Reduction Act of 2022**\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IR Act”) was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a U.S. federal 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. Because we may acquire a domestic corporation or engage in a transaction in which a domestic corporation becomes our parent or our affiliate and our securities trade on US stock exchange, we may become a “covered corporation” within the meaning of the IR Act. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax.\n\n**NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\n**Basis of Presentation**\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results and cash flows for the periods presented.\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Current Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024. The interim results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024 or for any future interim periods.\n\n10\n\n**Emerging Growth Company**\n\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\n\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company, which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\n\n**Use of Estimates**\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\n\n**Concentration of Credit Risk**\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Coverage of $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on this account and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account.\n\n**Cash Held in Trust Account**\n\nAt March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all of the assets held in the Trust Account were held in a demand deposit account. Prior to November 2023, the Trust Account was invested in marketable securities and money market funds.\n\n**Cash and Cash Equivalents**\n\nThe Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company had $38,609 and $61,977 in cash held in its operating account as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\n11\n\n**Income Taxes**\n\nThe Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\n\nASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position.\n\nThere is currently no taxation imposed on income by the Government of the Cayman Islands. In accordance with Cayman income tax regulations, income taxes are not levied on the Company. Consequently, income taxes are not reflected in the Company’s financial statements. The Company’s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.\n\n**Fair Value of Financial Instruments**\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” (“ASC 820”) approximates the carrying amounts represented in the condensed balance sheets, primarily due to their short-term nature.\n\n**Fair Value Measurements**\n\nThe Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually.\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities).\n\nThe following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities:\n\nLevel 1: | Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.  \n---|---  \nLevel 2: | Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.  \n---|---  \nLevel 3: | Unobservable inputs based on our assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  \n---|---  \n  \n12\n\nIn some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n\n**Derivative Financial Instruments**\n\nThe Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”). For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value on the grant date and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\n\n**Warrant Liabilities**\n\nThe Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815. The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments, meet the definition of a liability, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own ordinary shares, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.\n\nFor issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statement of operations.\n\nThe Company evaluated the Public Warrants (as defined in Note 7) and the Private Placement Warrants (collectively, the “Warrants”) in accordance with ASC 815, and concluded that a provision in the warrant agreement, dated December 2, 2021 (the “Warrant Agreement”) related to certain tender or exchange offers precludes the Warrants from being accounted for as components of equity. As the Warrants meet the definition of a derivative as contemplated in ASC 815, the Warrants are recorded as derivative liabilities on the condensed balance sheets and measured at fair value at inception (on the date of the IPO) and at each reporting date in accordance with ASC 820 with changes in fair value recognized in the condensed statement of operations in the period of change.\n\n**Offering Costs Associated with the Public Offering**\n\nThe Company complies with the requirements of ASC 340-10-S99-1, SEC Staff Accounting bulletin Topic 5A – “Expenses of Offering”, and SEC Staff Accounting bulletin Topic 5T – “Accounting for Expenses or Liabilities Paid by Principal Stockholder(s)”. Offering costs consist principally of professional and registration fees incurred through the balance sheet date that are related to the IPO. Offering costs directly attributable to the issuance of an equity contract to be classified in equity are recorded as a reduction of equity. Offering costs for equity contracts that are classified as assets and liabilities are expensed immediately. The Company incurred offering costs amounting to $12,517,335 as a result of the Public Offering (consisting of $3,795,000 of underwriting fees, $6,641,250 of deferred underwriting fees, $1,248,100 for the excess fair value of Founder Shares attributable to the Anchor Investor, and $832,985 of other offering costs). The Company recorded $10,788,729 of offering costs as a reduction of equity in connection with the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units. The Company immediately expensed $480,506 of offering costs in connection with the Warrants that were classified as liabilities.\n\n13\n\n**Class A Shares Subject to Possible Redemption**\n\nThe Company accounts for its Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC 480. Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption are classified as a liability instrument and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders’ equity. The Company’s Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption is presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders’ deficit section of the Company’s condensed balance sheets.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount of Class A ordinary shares reflected on the balance sheet are reconciled in the following table:\n\nClass A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption as of December 31, 2022 | $| 196,226,283  \n---|---|---  \nPlus  \nAdjust carrying value to initial redemption value | 7,774,907  \nLess  \nShares redeemed in September 2023 | (136,786,445| )  \nClass A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption as of December 31, 2023 | $| 67,214,745  \n---|---|---  \nPlus  \nAdjust carrying value to initial redemption value | 1,056,674  \nClass A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption as of March 31, 2024 | $| 68,271,419  \n  \n**Net (Loss) Income Per Ordinary Share**\n\nBasic (loss) income per ordinary share is computed by dividing net (loss) income applicable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Consistent with ASC 480, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption, as well as their pro rata share of undistributed trust earnings consistent with the two-class method, have been excluded from the calculation of (loss) income per ordinary share for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of trust earnings. Diluted (loss) income per share includes the incremental number of ordinary shares to be issued to settle warrants, as calculated for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The Company did not have any dilutive warrants, securities or other contracts that could potentially be exercised or converted into ordinary shares. As a result, diluted (loss) income per ordinary share is the same as basic (loss) income per ordinary share for all periods presented.\n\nA reconciliation of net (loss) income per ordinary share is as follows:\n\nFor the Three Months ended March 31, 2024 | For the Three Months ended March 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nClass A | Class B | Class A | Class B  \nEPS  \nNumerator: Net (Loss) Income  \nAllocation of net (loss) income | $| (54,380| ) | $| (41,896| ) | $| 1,311,721 | $| 327,930  \nDenominator: Weighted Average share  \nBasic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding | 6,157,215 | 4,743,750 | 18,975,000 | 4,743,750  \nBasic and diluted net (loss) income per ordinary share | $| (0.01| ) | $| (0.01| ) | $| 0.07 | $| 0.07  \n  \n14\n\n**Stock Compensation Expense**\n\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”). Under ASC 718, stock-based compensation associated with equity-classified awards is measured at fair value upon the grant date and recognized over the requisite service period. To the extent a stock-based award is subject to a performance condition, the amount of expense recorded in a given period, if any, reflects an assessment of the probability of achieving such performance condition, with compensation recognized once the event is deemed probable to occur. Forfeitures are recognized as incurred. The Company has not recognized any stock-based compensation expense during the three months ended March 31, 2024, and the period from inception to December 31, 2023.\n\n**Accounting Standards Recently Implemented**\n\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06 Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815–40) (“ASU 2020-06”). ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity’s own equity. The ASU is part of the FASB’s simplification initiative, which aims to reduce unnecessary complexity in GAAP. The ASU’s amendments are effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2024. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have a material impact on the Company’s unaudited condensed financial statements and disclosures.\n\n**Recently Issued Accounting Standards**\n\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.\n\n**NOTE 3. PUBLIC OFFERING**\n\nPursuant to the Public Offering, the Company sold 16,500,000 Units at $10.00 per Unit. On December 9, 2021, the underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option and purchased 2,475,000 Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $24,750,000. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, $0.0001 par value, and one-half of one redeemable warrant. Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share (see Note 7).\n\nAn Anchor Investor unaffiliated with any member of our management team purchased an aggregate of 1,895,602 of the Units sold in the Public Offering. These Units purchased by Apollo in this offering are not subject to any agreements restricting their transfer. Further, Apollo purchased 175,000 founder shares at $0.0058 per share.\n\nThe Company considers the excess fair value of the Founder Shares issued to the Anchor Investor above the purchase price as offering costs and will reduce the gross proceeds by this amount. The Company has valued the excess fair value over consideration of the founder shares offered to the Anchor Investor at $1,248,100. The excess of the fair value over consideration of the Founder Shares was determined to be an offering cost in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A and 5T and were allocated to shareholders’ equity and expenses upon the completion of the Public Offering.\n\n**NOTE 4. PRIVATE PLACEMENT**\n\nSimultaneously with the closing of Public Offering, the Sponsor and Anchor Investor purchased an aggregate of 8,235,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. On December 9, 2021, the Company consummated the sale of additional 990,000 Private Placement Warrants with the Sponsor at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of $990,000.\n\n15\n\nEach Private Placement Warrant is identical to the warrants offered in the Public Offering, except there is no redemption rights or liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to Private Placement Warrants, which will expire worthless if we do not consummate a Business Combination within the Combination Period. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants were added to the net proceeds from the Public Offering held in the Trust Account.\n\n**NOTE 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**\n\n**Founder Shares**\n\nOn March 26, 2021, the Company issued an aggregate of 4,312,500 shares of Class B ordinary shares (the “Founder Shares”) to the Sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. On December 2, 2021, the Company effected a share capitalization of an additional 431,250 Class B ordinary shares, resulting in an aggregate of 4,743,750 Class B ordinary shares outstanding. All share and per-share amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect the share capitalization.\n\nThe Sponsor and Anchor Investor have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of its Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) one year after the completion of a Business Combination or (B) subsequent to our initial Business Combination (x) if the last reported sale price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, share dividends, rights issuances, consolidations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and other similar transactions) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial Business Combination or (y) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of our Public Shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property.\n\nThe Anchor Investor has not been granted any shareholder or other rights in addition to those afforded to the Company’s other public shareholders. Further, the Anchor Investor is not required to (i) hold any Units, Class A ordinary shares or warrants purchased in the Public Offering or thereafter for any amount of time, (ii) vote any Class A ordinary shares they may own at the applicable time in favor of the Business Combination or (iii) refrain from exercising their right to redeem their public shares at the time of the Business Combination. The Anchor Investor has the same rights to the funds held in the Trust Account with respect to the Class A ordinary shares underlying the Units they purchased in the Public Offering as the rights afforded to the Company’s other public shareholders.\n\n**Related Party Loans**\n\nIn order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Company’s Sponsor, an affiliate of the Sponsor, or the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (the “Working Capital Loans”). Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of notes may be converted upon consummation of a Business Combination into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. There are no Working Capital Loans outstanding as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\n**Promissory Note – Related Party**\n\nOn June 20, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note (the “Note”) to the Sponsor for borrowings from time to time of up to an aggregate of $1,500,000 which may be drawn by the Company to finance costs incurred in connection with a potential initial business combination and for working capital purposes and/or to finance monthly deposits into the Trust Account for each public share that is not redeemed in connection with the extension of the Company’s termination date from September 7, 2023 to June 7, 2024. The Note is interest bearing and is payable on the earlier of (i) June 7, 2024; (ii) the date on which the Company consummates a Business Combination or (iii) the Company liquidates the Trust Account upon the failure to consummate an initial business combination within the requisite time period. Upon consummation of the Company’s initial business combination, the Note may be converted, at the Sponsor’s discretion, into private placement warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal balance under the Note amounted to an aggregate of $1,410,000 and 1,080,000, respectively.\n\n16\n\n**Sponsor Promissory Note**\n\nOn April 5, 2024, the Company entered into a promissory note with the Sponsor pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company a principal amount equal to $750,000 (the “Sponsor Promissory Note”). The Sponsor Promissory Note is a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note which may be drawn down by the Company from time to time to be used for costs and expenses related to the Company’s initial merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company and one or more businesses or entities. Pursuant to the terms of the Sponsor Promissory Note, if the Business Combination is not consummated, the Sponsor Promissory Note will be repaid solely to the extent that the Company has funds available to it outside of its Trust Account, and that all other amounts will be contributed to capital, forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven or eliminated. The Sponsor Promissory Note is subject to events of default, the occurrence of any of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal of the Sponsor Promissory Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Sponsor Note becoming immediately due and payable. As of March 31, 2024, there was no amount outstanding principal balance under the Sponsor Promissory Note.\n\n**Administrative Support Agreement**\n\nOn December 2, 2021, the Company entered into an administrative support agreement pursuant to which, until the Company’s initial business combination or liquidation, the Company may reimburse an affiliate of the Sponsor up to an amount of $10,000 per month for office space and secretarial and administrative support (the “Administrative Support Agreement”). As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there have been $30,000 and $120,000 in charges incurred, respectively.\n\n**Consulting Agreements**\n\nThe Company and Mr. Leggett entered into a consulting agreement on October 11, 2022, as amended July 31, 2023 (the “Leggett Consulting Agreement”). Under the Leggett Consulting Agreement, Mr. Leggett is entitled to $20,000 per month for certain services Mr. Leggett provides to the Company and its affiliates. Mr. Leggett is separately entitled under the Leggett Consulting Agreement to a success bonus of $250,000 to be paid within 10 business days of the close of the business combination, subject to a reduction by $17,500 for each month in which the Company pays Mr. Leggett a consulting service fee under the Leggett Consulting Agreement. The Company and Mr. Lasov entered into a consulting agreement on November 22, 2022, as amended July 31, 2023 (the “Lasov Consulting Agreement”). Under the Lasov Consulting Agreement, Mr. Lasov is entitled to $32,500 per month for certain services Mr. Lasov provides to the Company and its affiliates. Mr. Lasov is separately entitled under the Lasov Consulting Agreement to a success bonus of $150,000 to be paid within 10 business days of the close of the business combination, subject to a reduction by the amount of each consulting service fee paid to Mr. Lasov by the Company under the Lasov Consulting Agreement. Mr. Lasov has agreed that as of February 1, 2024, he will not be invoicing the Company for services performed under the Lasov Consulting Agreement with the Company. Mr. Leggett has agreed that as of April 1, 2024, he will reduce his monthly service fee under the Leggett Consulting Agreement to $5,000.\n\n17\n\n**NOTE 6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**\n\n**Registration Rights**\n\nThe holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and any warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans (and in each case holders of their component securities, as applicable) are entitled to registration rights pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, effective December 2, 2021, which requires the Company to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to our Class A ordinary shares). The holders of the majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the consummation of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. \n\n**Underwriter’s Agreement**\n\nThe Company paid a cash underwriting discount of 2.00% of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering, or $3,795,000 due to the exercise of the over-allotment option in full. In addition, the underwriter is entitled to a deferred fee of three and a half percent (3.50%) of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering, or $6,641,250. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. The underwriter has reimbursed the Company for $550,000 for offering expenses. The reimbursement of these costs has been accounted for as a reduction to offering costs of the Public Offering.\n\n**NOTE 7. WARRANTS**\n\nThe Company accounted for the 18,712,500 warrants issued in connection with the Public Offering (the 9,487,500 Public Warrants and the 9,225,000 Private Placement Warrants) in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815. Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each warrant much be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, the Company has classified each warrant as a liability at its fair value. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the Company’s statement of operations.\n\n18\n\n** _Warrants-_** Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants will become exercisable 30 days after the consummation of a Business Combination. The Public Warrants will expire five years from the consummation of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.\n\nThe Company will not be obligated to deliver any Class A ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a Public Warrant and will have no obligation to settle such Public Warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration. No Public Warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their Public Warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available.\n\nThe Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days, after the closing of a Business Combination, it will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement registering the issuance, under the Securities Act, of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the shares of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants, to cause such registration statement to become effective and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the Warrant Agreement. If a registration statement covering the shares of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th business day after the closing of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption.\n\n**_Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $ 18.00. _**\n\nOnce the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the Warrants for redemption:\n\n●| in whole and not in part;  \n---|---  \n●| at a price of $0.01 per Public Warrant;  \n---|---  \n●| upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder and  \n---|---  \n●| if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company will not redeem the warrants as described above unless an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares is available throughout the 30-day redemption period. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, the Company may exercise its redemption right even if the Company is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.\n\n**_Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $ 10.00._**\n\nOnce the Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the Warrants for redemption: \n\n●| in whole and not in part;  \n---|---  \n●| at $0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption provided that holders will be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares determined by reference to the table based on the redemption date and the “fair market value” of our Class A ordinary shares;  \n---|---  \n  \n19\n\n●| if, and only if, the Reference Value (as defined above under “Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $18.00”) equals or exceeds $10.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant); and  \n---|---  \n●| if the Reference Value is less than $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant), the Private Placement Warrants must also concurrently be called for redemption on the same terms as the outstanding Public Warrants, as described above.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf and when the Public Warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may not exercise its redemption right if the issuance of shares of ordinary shares upon exercise of the warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or the Company is unable to effect such registration or qualification. \n\nThe exercise price and number of shares of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Public Warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless. If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the Warrant Agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless.\n\nIn addition, if (x) the Company issues additional shares of Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of its initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of Class A ordinary shares (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company’s board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the Sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the “Newly Issued Price”), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the Company’s initial Business Combination on the date of the consummation of such initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price and the $18.00 per share redemption trigger price described above will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the greater of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.\n\nThe Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants included in the Units sold in the Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants and the shares of ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants are not transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis and are non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.\n\n**NOTE 8. SHAREHOLDERS’ DEFICIT**\n\n**_Preferred Shares_** -The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value preferred shares. On March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no preferred shares issued or outstanding.\n\n**_Class A Ordinary shares_** -The Company is authorized to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of Class A, $0.0001 par value ordinary shares. Holders of the Company’s ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share.\n\n20\n\n** _Class B Ordinary shares_** -The Company is authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of Class B, $0.0001 par value ordinary shares. Holders of the Company’s ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share. On December 2, 2021, the Company effected a share capitalization of an additional 431,250 Class B ordinary shares, resulting in an aggregate of 4,743,750 Class B ordinary shares outstanding, after giving effect to the repurchase by the Sponsor of 25,000 Class B ordinary shares from Dale Mathias upon her resignation from the Board. All share and per-share amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect the share capitalization.\n\nHolders of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all other matters submitted to a vote of shareholders, except as required by law; provided that only holders of Class B ordinary shares have the right to vote for the election of directors prior to the Company’s initial Business Combination.\n\nThe shares of Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of our initial Business Combination, or earlier at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for share sub-divisions, share dividends, rights issuances, consolidations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like, and subject to further adjustment as provided herein. In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts issued in this offering and related to the closing of our initial Business Combination, the ratio at which the Class B ordinary shares will convert into Class A ordinary shares will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding Class B ordinary shares agree to waive such anti-dilution adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Class B ordinary shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of all ordinary shares issued and outstanding upon the completion of this offering plus all Class A ordinary shares and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with our initial Business Combination, excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in our initial Business Combination. The term “equity-linked securities” refers to any debt or equity securities that are convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for our Class A ordinary shares issued in a financing transaction in connection with our initial business combination, including but not limited to a private placement of equity or debt.\n\nPursuant to and concurrently with the Public Offering, the Company sold 18,975,000 Units. In connection with Extraordinary General Meeting, the shareholders of record were provided the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights. Holders of 12,817,785 shares of Class A ordinary shareholders exercised their right to redemption. Following the redemption, the Company had a total of 6,157,215 shares of Class A ordinary shares outstanding.\n\nAt March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding, excluding 6,157,215 of Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption (see Note 2), and 4,743,750 of Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding.\n\n**NOTE 9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS**\n\nThe following table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis on March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value:\n\nMarch 31, 2024 | Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) | Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) | Significant Other Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  \n---|---|---|---  \nAssets:  \nCash held in Trust Account | $| 68,271,419 | $| 68,271,419 | $| — | $| —  \nLiabilities:  \nWarrant liabilities – Public Warrants | $| 182,160 | $| — | $| 182,160 | $| —  \nWarrant liabilities – Private Placement Warrants | $| 177,120 | $| — | $| — | $| 177,120  \nDecember 31, 2023 | Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) | Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) | Significant Other Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  \n---|---|---|---  \nAssets:  \nCash held in Trust Account | $| 67,214,745 | $| 67,214,745 | $| — | $| —  \nLiabilities:  \nWarrant liabilities – Public Warrants | $| 189,750 | $| — | $| 189,750 | $| —  \nWarrant liabilities – Private Placement Warrants | $| 184,500 | $| — | $| — | $| 184,500  \n  \n21\n\nThe Warrants are accounted for as liabilities in accordance with ASC 815 and are presented within warrant liabilities on the condensed balance sheets. The warrant liabilities are measured at fair value at inception and on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented within change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the condensed statements of operations. Transfers to/from Levels 1, 2 and 3 are recognized at the beginning of the reporting period in which a change in valuation technique or methodology occurs.\n\nThe Company established the initial fair value for the warrant liabilities on December 7, 2021, the date of the Company’s Public Offering, using a Binomial Lattice-based model for the Public Warrants, and a Black-Scholes option pricing model for the Private Placement Warrants. The Private Placement Warrants and Public Warrants were classified as Level 3 at the initial measurement date due to the use of unobservable inputs. The estimated fair value of Public Warrants was transferred from a Level 3 measurement to a Level 1 measurement when the Public Warrants were separately listed and traded in an active market in January 2022.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of Public Warrants was transferred from a Level 1 measurement to a Level 2 measurement when the Public Warrants were considered to no longer have an active market.\n\nThe Private Placement Warrants were valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is considered to be a Level 3 fair value measurement. The key inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the Private Placement Warrants were as follows as of March 31, 2024:\n\nInput | March 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---|---  \nRisk-free interest rate | — | —  \nExpected term (years) | 4.50 | 4.78  \nExpected volatility | — | —  \nExercise price | $| 11.50 | $| 11.50  \nFair value of Class A ordinary shares | $| 11.05 | $| 10.28  \n  \nThe Company’s use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model required the use of subjective assumptions:\n\n● | The risk-free interest rate assumption was based on the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rate for the expected term of the warrants.  \n---|---  \n● | The expected term was determined utilizing a probability weighted term input to be consistent with the stock price and volatility inputs which are reflective of the probability of successful merger.  \n---|---  \n● | The expected volatility assumption was based on the implied volatility solved by calibrating the warrant value output from a Binomial Lattice based model to the publicly observed, traded price on each valuation date. An increase in the expected volatility, in isolation, would result in an increase in the fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities and vice versa.  \n---|---  \n● | The fair value of one Class A ordinary share is the publicly-traded stock price.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe following table presents the changes in the fair value of the Company’s Level 3 financial instruments that are measured at fair value:\n\nFair value as of December 31, 2022 | $| 691,875  \n---|---|---  \nChange in fair value | 139,298  \nFair value as of March 31, 2023 | $| 831,173  \nChange in fair value | (433,575| )  \nFair value as of June 30, 2023 | $| 397,598  \nChange in fair value | 119,925  \nFair value as of September 30, 2023 | $| 517,523  \nChange in fair value | (333,023| )  \nFair value as of December 31, 2023 | $| 184,500  \nChange in fair value | (7,380| )  \nFair value as of March 31, 2024 | $| 177,120  \n  \n22\n\n**NOTE 10. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**\n\nManagement of the Company evaluated events that have occurred after the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were issued. Based upon this review, management did not identify any recognized or unrecognized subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.\n\nIn accordance with the Extension Amendment, on April 1, 2024 and May 1, 2024, the Company deposited $60,000 into the Trust Account in order to effect additional one month extensions, which extended the deadline to June 7, 2024 to consummate the Business Combination. \n\nAs noted in Note 5 above, Mr. Leggett has agreed that as of April 1, 2024 he will reduce his monthly service fee under the Leggett Consulting Agreement to $5,000.\n\nOn April 5, 2024 the Company entered into a promissory note with the Sponsor pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company a principal amount equal to $750,000 (the “Sponsor Promissory Note”). The Sponsor Promissory Note is a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note which may be drawn down by the Company from time to time to be used for costs and expenses related to the Company’s initial merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company and one or more businesses or entities.\n\n23\n\n**Item 2.

In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “would” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described under the heading “Risk Factors” of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 21, 2024 and under the heading “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Quarterly Report. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.\n\n**Overview**\n\nWe are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities.\n\nOn June 6, 2023, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with The News Lens Co., Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company (“TNL”), and TNL Mediagene, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly owned subsidiary of TNL (“Merger Sub”). On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the parties thereto will enter into a business combination transaction (the “Business Combination” and together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Transactions”), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into us, with us surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of TNL (the “Merger”).\n\nAt the closing of the Transactions (the “Closing”), by virtue of the Merger, our outstanding shares and warrants will be canceled and converted into the right to receive equivalent shares and warrants of TNL, and TNL is expected to be the publicly traded company with its ordinary shares and warrants listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”).\n\n24\n\nWe intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of the Public Offering, the sale of the Private Placement Warrants and the Additional Private Placement Warrants, our capital shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt. The Company is an “emerging growth company”, and as such, the Company is subject to all risks associated with emerging growth companies.\n\nOn August 29, 2023, shareholders of the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the “Extraordinary General Meeting”) in lieu of the 2023 annual general meeting of the shareholders of the Company. At the Extraordinary General Meeting, the Company’s shareholders approved the proposal to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to give the Company the right to extend the date by which it has to consummate a business combination from September 7, 2023 to June 7, 2024, by depositing into the Trust Account $60,000 for each of the nine subsequent one-month extensions. In connection therewith the shareholders of record were provided the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights (the “Extension Amendment”). Holders of 12,817,785 shares of Class A ordinary shareholders exercised their right to redemption at a per share redemption price of approximately $10.67. On September 5, 2023, a total of $136,786,445 in redemption payments were made in connection with this redemption. Following the redemption, the Company had a total of 6,157,215 shares of Class A ordinary shares outstanding\n\nAs of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash of approximately $38,609 and $61,977 respectively. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 we had a working capital deficit of approximately $5,372,722 and $4,204,802, respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to complete a business combination will be successful.\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\nWe did not commence operations until after the closing of our Public Offering in December 2021, and as of March 31, 2024, we have not engaged in any significant operations nor generated any operating revenues to date. We will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial Business Combination. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents. There has been no significant change in our financial or trading position and no material adverse change has occurred since the date of our audited financial statements. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, we had net loss of $96,276 which was impacted by the change in fair value of warrant liability of $14,970, interest earned on cash held in trust account of $876,674 offset by interest expense of $2,630 and a loss from operations of $985,290.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, we had net income of $1,639,651 which was impacted by interest earned on marketable securities held in the trust account of $2,138,122, change in fair value of warrant liability of $282,559, unrealized gain on marketable securities held in the trust account of $92,492, and a loss from operations of $308,404.\n\n25\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nOn December 7, 2021, we consummated our Public Offering of 16,500,000 Units and the Private Placement of an aggregate of 8,235,000 private placement warrants, generating gross proceeds of $173,235,000. On December 9, 2021, the Underwriter exercised in full the option granted to them by the Company to purchase up to 2,475,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, and we issued an additional 990,000 Private Placement Warrants in the Additional Private Placement, generating total gross proceeds of $25,245,000.\n\nFollowing our Public Offering, the exercise of the over-allotment option and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, a total of $193,545,000 was placed in the Trust Account. We incurred $12,517,335 in transaction costs, including $3,795,000 in cash underwriting fees, $6,641,250 of deferred underwriting fees, $1,248,100 of offering costs related to the fair value of the Founder Shares sold to Anchor Investor, and $832,985 of other offering costs.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, cash used in operating activities was $273,328. Net loss of $96,276 was impacted by interest earned on cash held in the Trust Account of $876,674, change in fair value of warrant liability of $14,970, interest expense of $2,630 and changes in operating assets and liabilities, $711,962.\n\nAs of Mach 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had investments of $68,271,419 and $67,214,745 held in the Trust Account, respectively. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less taxes paid and deferred underwriting commissions) to complete our initial Business Combination. We may withdraw interest to pay taxes.\n\nIn connection with Extraordinary General Meeting, the shareholders of record were provided the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights. Holders of 12,817,785 shares of Class A ordinary shareholders exercised their right to redemption, subsequently a total of $136,786,445 in redemption payments were made in connection with this redemption from the Trust Account. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, we did not withdraw any other interest earned on the Trust Account. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash of $38,609 and $61,977 outside of the Trust Account, respectively. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete our initial Business Combination.\n\nIn addition, in order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial Business Combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. Otherwise, such loans may be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that our initial Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination company, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender.\n\nOn June 20, 2023, the Company entered into a Promissory Note (as defined in Note 5) with the Sponsor pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company up to an aggregate principal amount of up to $1,500,000. The Promissory Note is payable on the earlier of the date on which the Company consummates a Business Combination or June 7, 2024. Upon the consummation of the Business Combination, the Sponsor will have the option, but not the obligation, to convert the entire principal balance of the Promissory Note, in whole or in part, into private placement warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The terms of such private placement warrants (if issued) will be identical to the terms of the private placement warrants issued by the Company in connection with the IPO. The Promissory Note is subject to customary events of default, the occurrence of any of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal and interest balance of the Promissory Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Sponsor Note becoming immediately due and payable. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the outstanding principal balance under the Note amounted to an aggregate of $1,410,000 and $1,080,000, respectively.\n\n26\n\nOn August 3, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to TNL with a principal amount equal to $400,000 (the “TNL Working Capital Note”). The TNL Working Capital Note is a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note that will not be repaid in the event that the Merger agreement is terminated prior to the Business Combination. The TNL Working Capital Note will be paid on the date on which the Company consummates the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The following shall constitute an event of default under the TNL Working Capital Note: (i) a failure to pay the principal within five business days of the maturity date and (ii) the commencement of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy action. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the outstanding principal balance under the TNL Working Capital Note amounted to an aggregate of $249,906 and $149,946, respectively.\n\nOn April 5, 2024, the Company entered into a promissory note with the Sponsor pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company a principal amount equal to $750,000 (the “Sponsor Promissory Note”). The Sponsor Promissory Note is a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note which may be drawn down by the Company from time to time to be used for costs and expenses related to the Company’s initial merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company and one or more businesses or entities. Pursuant to the terms of the Sponsor Promissory Note, if the Business Combination is not consummated, the Sponsor Promissory Note will be repaid solely to the extent that the Company has funds available to it outside of its Trust Account, and that all other amounts will be contributed to capital, forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven or eliminated. The Sponsor Promissory Note is subject to events of default, the occurrence of any of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal of the Sponsor Promissory Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Sponsor Note becoming immediately due and payable. As of March 31, 2024, there was no amount outstanding under the Sponsor Promissory Note.\n\nOver this time period, the Company will be using these funds for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination.\n\nIn connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with the authoritative guidance in FASB ASU 2014-15, “Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.” The Company has until June 7, 2024, to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by the specified period. If a Business Combination is not consummated by June 7, 2024 and the Company decides not to extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution.\n\nThe Company’s evaluation of its liquidity condition and the date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern one year from the date that these condensed financial statements are issued. These condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\n\n**Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements**\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, we did not have any obligations, assets or liabilities that would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations.\n\n**Contractual Obligations**\n\n _Administrative Support Agreement_\n\nThe Company has an Administrative Support Agreement pursuant to which the Company may reimburse an affiliate of the Sponsor up to an amount of $10,000 per month for office space and secretarial and administrative support.\n\n27\n\n _Registration Rights_\n\nThe holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and any warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans (and in each case holders of their component securities, as applicable) are entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement effective December 2, 2021, which requires the Company to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to our Class A ordinary shares). The holders of the majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the consummation of a business combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\n\n_Underwriter’s Agreement_\n\nThe Company paid a cash underwriting discount of 2.00% of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering, or $3,795,000 due to the exercise of the over-allotment option in full. In addition, the underwriter will be entitled to a deferred fee of three and a half percent (3.50%) of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering, or $6,641,250. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. The underwriter has reimbursed the Company for $550,000 for offering expenses. The reimbursement of these costs has been accounted for as a reduction to offering costs of the Public Offering.\n\n_Consulting Agreements_\n\nThe Company and Mr. Leggett entered into a consulting agreement on October 11, 2022, as amended July 31, 2023 (the “Leggett Consulting Agreement”). Under the Leggett Consulting Agreement, Mr. Leggett is entitled to $20,000 per month for certain services Mr. Leggett provides to the Company and its affiliates. Mr. Leggett is separately entitled under the Leggett Consulting Agreement to a success bonus of $250,000 to be paid within 10 business days of the close of the business combination, subject to a reduction by $17,500 for each month in which the Company pays Mr. Leggett a consulting service fee under the Leggett Consulting Agreement. The Company and Mr. Lasov entered into a consulting agreement on November 22, 2022, as amended July 31, 2023 (the “Lasov Consulting Agreement”). Under the Lasov Consulting Agreement, Mr. Lasov is entitled to $32,500 per month for certain services Mr. Lasov provides to the Company and its affiliates. Mr. Lasov is separately entitled under the Lasov Consulting Agreement to a success bonus of $150,000 to be paid within 10 business days of the close of the business combination, subject to a reduction by the amount of each consulting service fee paid to Mr. Lasov by the Company under the Lasov Consulting Agreement. Mr. Lasov has agreed that as of February 1, 2024, he will not be invoicing the Company for services performed under the Lasov Consulting Agreement with the Company. Mr. Leggett has agreed that as of April 1, 2024, he will reduce his monthly service fee under the Leggett Consulting Agreement to $5,000.\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**\n\nThis management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our unaudited financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our unaudited financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to fair value of financial instruments and accrued expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\n_Warrant Liabilities_\n\nThe Company accounts for the Warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the specific terms of the Warrants and the applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815. The assessment considers whether they are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the Warrants are indexed to the Company’s own ordinary shares and whether the holders of the Warrants could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of issuance of the Warrants and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the Warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, such warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, such warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of liability-classified warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statement of operations.\n\n28\n\n _Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption_\n\nClass A ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Class A ordinary shares (including Class A ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Class A ordinary shares are classified as shareholders’ equity. Our Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 6,175,215 shares of Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented as temporary equity, respectively, outside of the shareholders’ deficit section of the Company’s condensed balance sheets.\n\n_Net (Loss) Income Per Ordinary Share_\n\nBasic (loss) income per ordinary share is computed by dividing net (loss) income applicable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Consistent with ASC 480, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption, as well as their pro rata share of undistributed trust earnings consistent with the two-class method, have been excluded from the calculation of (loss) income per ordinary share for the three month period ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. Such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of trust earnings. Diluted (loss) income per share includes the incremental number of ordinary shares to be issued to settle warrants, as calculated using the treasury method. For the period from December 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024, the Company did not have any dilutive warrants, securities or other contracts that could potentially, be exercised or converted into ordinary shares. As a result, diluted (loss) income per ordinary share is the same as basic (loss) income per ordinary share for all periods presented.\n\n_Recently Adopted Accounting Standard_\n\nIn August 2020 the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06 Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815–40) (“ASU 2020-06”). ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity’s own equity. The ASU is part of the FASB’s simplification initiative, which aims to reduce unnecessary complexity in GAAP. The ASU’s amendments are effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2024. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have a material impact on the Company’s unaudited condensed financial statements and disclosures.\n\n_Recently Issued Accounting Standards_\n\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.\n\n_JOBS Act_\n\nOn April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected to irrevocably opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we will adopt the new or revised standard at the time public companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another emerging growth company that has not opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.\n\nAdditionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an “emerging growth company”, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive Officer’s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our Public Offering or until we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” whichever is earlier.\n\n29\n\n**Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.**\n\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item.\n\n**Item 4. Controls and Procedures.**\n\n_Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures_\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below.\n\nAs previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, that was filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024, our management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting due to the fact that we did not have the necessary business processes and related internal controls formally designed and implemented related to accrued expenses and accounts payable. As a result, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles including implementing the remediation activities as described below. Accordingly, management believes that the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the period presented.\n\nDisclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\n_Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting_\n\n _Historical Remediation Activities_\n\nAs previously disclosed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, management identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting related to accrued expenses and accounts payable.\n\nThe Company has performed the following remediation activities to confirm its accounts payable obligations:\n\n●| We confirmed that no member of management or advisor providing services to the Company has unsubmitted or unreimbursed expenses or fees, and  \n---|---  \n●| we confirmed that the Company was current with its payables to its service providers.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe are committed to ensuring that our internal controls are designed and operating effectively. Management believes the efforts taken to date and the planned remediation will improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. While these remediation efforts are ongoing, the controls must also be operating effectively for a sufficient period of time and be tested by management in order to consider them remediated and conclude that the controls are operating effectively to address the risks of material misstatement.\n\n_Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting_\n\nExcept for the steps taken as part of the remediation activities described above, there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n30\n\n**PART II - OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**Item 1. Legal Proceedings.**\n\nWe are not a party to any material legal proceedings and no material legal proceedings have been threatened by us or, to the best of our knowledge, against us.\n\n**Item 1A. Risk Factors.**\n\nFactors that could cause our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition to differ materially from the descriptions provided in this report include the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024. In addition, the following risk factor could also have such an effect.\n\n**_A 1% U.S. federal excise tax may decrease the value of our securities following an initial business combination, or hinder our ability to consummate an initial business combination._**\n\nPursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IR Act”), commencing in 2023, a 1% U.S. federal excise tax is imposed on certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock by publicly traded domestic (i.e., U.S.) corporations and certain domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation and not on its shareholders. The amount of the excise tax is equal to 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. Although we are a Cayman Islands company, the excise tax may apply in connection with redemptions or other repurchases that occur in connection with an initial business combination that involves our combination with a U.S. entity and/or our domestication as a U.S. corporation (a “Redemption Event”). In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by us and not by the redeeming holders, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax remains to be determined. Any excise tax payable by us in connection with a Redemption Event may cause a reduction in the cash available to us to complete an initial business combination and could affect our ability to complete an initial business combination** _._**\n\n**_The SEC has recently issued final rules to regulate special purpose acquisition companies. Certain of the procedures that we, a potential business combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with such proposals may increase our costs and the time needed to complete our initial business combination and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete a business combination._**\n\nOn January 24, 2024, the SEC issued final rules (the “SPAC Rules”) relating to, among other things, disclosures in business combination transactions between special purpose acquisition companies (“SPACs”) such as us and private operating companies; the condensed financial statement requirements applicable to transactions involving shell companies; and the use of projections by SPACs in SEC filings in connection with proposed business combination transactions. The SPAC Rules will become effective 125 days after their publication in the Federal Register. In connection with the issuance of the SPAC Rules, the SEC also issued guidance (the “SPAC Guidance”) regarding the potential liability of certain participants in proposed business combination transactions and the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“Investment Company Act”) based on certain facts and circumstances such as duration, asset composition, sources of income, business purpose and activities of the SPAC and its management team in furtherance of such goals.\n\nCertain of the procedures that we, a potential business combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with the SPAC Rules, or pursuant to the SEC’s views expressed in the SPAC Guidance, may increase the costs and the time required to consummate a business combination, and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete a business combination.\n\n**_If we were deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we may be forced to abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead be required to liquidate and dissolve the Company._**\n\nAs described above, the SPAC Guidance relates to, among other things, the circumstances in which SPACs such as us could potentially be subject to the Investment Company Act and the regulations thereunder. Whether a SPAC is an investment company will be a question of facts and circumstances under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act. A specific duration period of a SPAC is not the sole determinant, but one of the long-standing factors to consider in determination of a SPAC’s status under the Investment Company Act. A SPAC could be deemed as an investment company at any stage of its operation. The determination of a SPAC’s status as an investment company includes analysis of a SPAC’s activities, depending upon the facts and circumstances, including but not limited to, the nature of SPAC assets and income, the activities of a SPAC’s officers, directors and employees, the duration of a SPAC, the manner a SPAC holding itself out to investors, and the merging with an investment company.\n\n31\n\nIt is possible that a claim could be made that we have been operating as an unregistered investment company, including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, based on the current views of the SEC. If we were deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we might be forced to abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead be required to liquidate the Company. If we are required to liquidate the Company, our investors would not be able to realize the benefits of owning shares in a successor operating business, including the potential appreciation in the value of our shares and warrants following such a transaction, and our warrants would expire worthless.\n\nIn an effort to mitigate the risk that we may be deemed to have been operating as an unregistered investment company under the Investment Company Act, we instructed Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the trustee with respect to the Trust Account, to liquidate the U.S. government securities held in the Trust Account in November 2023 and to thereafter hold all funds in the Trust Account in an interest bearing demand deposit account until the earlier of the consummation of our Business Combination or our liquidation. There can be no assurance that this action will foreclose a judicial or regulatory finding, or an allegation, that the Company is an investment company.\n\n**_Termination of the Transactions could negatively impact Blue Ocean._**\n\nIf the Transactions are not completed for any reason, including as a result of our shareholders declining to approve the proposals required to effect the Transactions, our ongoing business may be adversely impacted and, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Transactions, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\n●| we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our share price (including to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Transactions will be completed);  \n---|---  \n●| we will have incurred substantial expenses and will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Transactions, whether or not the Transactions are completed; and  \n---|---  \n●| since the Merger Agreement restricts the conduct of our businesses prior to completion of the Merger, we may not be able to take certain actions during the pendency of the Merger that would benefit us as an independent company, and the opportunity to take such actions may no longer be available.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf the Transactions are terminated and our board of directors seeks another business combination target, our shareholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find another acquisition target that would constitute a business combination or that such other business combination will be completed.\n\n**_The Transactions may be more difficult, costly, or time-consuming than expected, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Transactions._**\n\nTo realize the anticipated benefits from the Transactions, we must successfully integrate and combine our business with that of TNL Mediagene. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the Transactions may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, the actual benefits of the Transactions could be less than anticipated, and integration may result in additional unforeseen expenses. In addition, we and TNL Mediagene have operated and, until the completion of the Transactions, must continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of one or more key employees, the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies that adversely affect each company’s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Transactions. Integration efforts between the companies may also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the Company during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the Transactions.\n\n**Item 2.

DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS**\n\nBlue Ocean Acquisition Corp (the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on March 26, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”). The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.\n\nOn June 6, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Original Merger Agreement”) with TNL Mediagene (formerly, “The News Lens Co., Ltd.”), a Cayman Islands exempted company and TNLMG (formerly “TNL Mediagene”), a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly owned subsidiary of TNL Mediagene (“Merger Sub”), as amended by the Amendment to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 29, 2024 (the “Amendment” and together with the Original Merger Agreement, the “Merger Agreement”). On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the parties thereto will enter into a business combination transaction pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of TNL Mediagene (the “Merger”).\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had not yet commenced any operations. All activity through June 30, 2024, relates to the Company’s formation and the initial public offering (the “Public Offering”) which is described below, and subsequent to the Public Offering, identifying a target for a Business Combination, including the negotiation of the Merger Agreement. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end.\n\nThe registration statement for the Company’s Public Offering was declared effective on December 6, 2021 (the “Effective Date”). On December 7, 2021, the Company consummated the Public Offering of 16,500,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units offered, the “Public Shares”), generating gross proceeds of $165,000,000 which is described in Note 3. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company and one-half of one redeemable warrant (the “Public Warrants”). On December 9, 2021, the underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option and purchased 2,475,000 units (the “Over-Allotment Option Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Over-Allotment Option Unit, generating gross proceeds of $24,750,000.\n\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 8,235,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant that closed in a private placement to Blue Ocean Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”) and Apollo SPAC Fund I, L.P. (“Apollo” or “Anchor Investor”) simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering (see Note 4). On December 9, 2021, the Company consummated the sale of additional 990,000 Private Placement Warrants (the “Additional Private Placement Warrants”) with the Sponsor at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of $990,000.\n\nTransaction costs amounted to $12,517,335, consisting of $3,795,000 in cash underwriting fees, $6,641,250 of deferred underwriting fees, $1,248,100 of offering costs related to the fair value of the Founder Shares sold to Anchor Investor, and $832,985 of other offering costs.\n\nFollowing the closing of the Public Offering, the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, the sale of the Over-Allotment Option Units and the sale of the Additional Private Placement Shares, an amount of $193,545,000 ($10.20 per Public Unit) was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”), located in the United States and will be invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds held in the Trust Account, as described below.\n\n5\n\nExtraordinary General Meeting and Redemption of Class A Shares \n\nOn August 29, 2023, shareholders of the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the “Extraordinary General Meeting”) in lieu of the 2023 annual general meeting of the shareholders of the Company. At the Extraordinary General Meeting, the Company’s shareholders approved the proposal to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to give the Company the right to extend the date by which it has to consummate a business combination from September 7, 2023 to June 7, 2024, by depositing into the Trust Account $60,000 for each of the nine subsequent one-month extensions. In connection therewith the shareholders of record were provided the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights (the “Extension Amendment”). Holders of 12,817,785 Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redemption at a per share redemption price of approximately $10.67. On September 5, 2023, a total of $136,786,445 in redemption payments were made in connection with this redemption. Following the redemption, the Company had a total of 6,157,215 Class A ordinary shares outstanding.\n\nOn May 29, 2024, shareholders of the Company held an Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders in lieu of the 2024 annual general meeting of the shareholders of the company (the “Second Extension Meeting”). At the Second Extension Meeting, the Company’s shareholders approved the proposal to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to give the Company the right to further extend the date by which it has to consummate a business combination from June 7, 2024 to December 7, 2024, by depositing into the Trust Account $30,000 for each of the six subsequent one-month extensions. In connection therewith the shareholders of record were provided the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights (the “Second Extension Amendment”). Holders of 4,315,265 Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redemption at a per share redemption price of approximately $11.20. On June 3, 2024, a total of $48,321,747 in redemption payments were made in connection with this redemption. Following the redemption, the Company had a total of 1,841,950 Class A ordinary shares outstanding.\n\nOn January 24, 2024, the SEC issued final rules (the “SPAC Rules”) relating to, among other things, disclosures in business combination transactions between special purpose acquisition companies (“SPACs”) such as us and private operating companies; the condensed financial statement requirements applicable to transactions involving shell companies; and the use of projections by SPACs in SEC filings in connection with proposed business combination transactions. In connection with the issuance of the SPAC Rules, the SEC also issued guidance (the “SPAC Guidance”) regarding the potential liability of certain participants in proposed business combination transactions and the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“Investment Company Act”) based on certain facts and circumstances such as duration, asset composition, sources of income, business purpose and activities of the SPAC and its management team in furtherance of such goals.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of us being deemed to be an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act) and thus subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, in November 2023, the Company instructed Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the trustee with respect to the Trust Account, to liquidate the U.S. government treasury obligations or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter deposited the cash from the liquidation of the trust assets into an interest-bearing demand deposit account until the earlier of the consummation of the initial Business Combination or the Company’s liquidation, with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company continuing to act as trustee. As a result, following such liquidation, we would receive minimal interest, if any, on the funds held in the trust account, which would reduce the dollar amount our public shareholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company.\n\nThe Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. NASDAQ rules provide that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing a definitive agreement to enter a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination.\n\n6\n\nThe Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the “public shareholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. In connection with a proposed Business Combination, the Company may seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against a Business Combination. The Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if TNL Mediagene has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks shareholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that, a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to 15% or more of the Public Shares without the Company’s prior written consent.\n\nThe public shareholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially $10.20 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The per-share amount to be distributed to shareholders who redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriter (as discussed in Note 7). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company’s warrants. These Class A ordinary shares are recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity” (“ASC 480”).\n\nIf a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Memorandum and Articles of Association, offer such redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination.\n\nThe Company’s Sponsor and Apollo have agreed (a) to vote their Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination, (b) not to propose an amendment to the Company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association with respect to the Company’s pre-Business Combination activities prior to the consummation of a Business Combination unless the Company provides dissenting Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment; (c) not to redeem any shares (including the Founder Shares) into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a Business Combination (or to sell any shares in a tender offer in connection with a Business Combination if the Company does not seek shareholder approval in connection therewith) or a vote to amend the provisions of the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association relating to shareholders’ rights of pre-Business Combination activity and (d) that the Founder Shares shall not participate in any liquidating distributions upon winding up if a Business Combination is not consummated. However, the Sponsor and Apollo will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares purchased during or after the Public Offering if the Company fails to complete its Business Combination.\n\nIf the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Company’s board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company, subject in each case to its obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law.\n\n7\n\nThe underwriter has agreed to waive its rights to the deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).\n\nThe Sponsor and Apollo have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to the Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants it will receive if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor, Apollo or any of their respective affiliates acquire Public Shares, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.\n\nIn order to protect the amounts held in the trust, the Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.20 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the day of liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.20 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriter of Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and believe that the Sponsor’s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot assure its shareholders that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of the Company’s officers or directors will indemnify the Company for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.\n\n**Business Combination**\n\nOn June 6, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Original Merger Agreement”) with TNL Mediagene (formerly “The News Lens Co., Ltd.”) a Cayman Islands exempted company and TNLMG (formerly “TNL Mediagene”), a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly owned subsidiary of TNL Mediagene (“Merger Sub”), as amended by the Amendment to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of May 29, 2024 (the “Amendment” and together with the Original Merger Agreement, the “Merger Agreement”). On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the parties thereto will enter into a business combination transaction pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of TNL Mediagene (the “Merger”).\n\nAt the closing of the Transactions (the “Closing”), by virtue of the Merger, the outstanding shares and warrants will be canceled and converted into the right to receive equivalent shares and warrants of TNL Mediagene, and TNL Mediagene is expected to be the publicly traded company with its ordinary shares and warrants listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”).\n\nOn May 29, 2024, the Company, TNL Mediagene and Merger Sub executed the Amendment to the Merger Agreement to extend the date to complete the Merger from June 7, 2024 to December 7, 2024.\n\n8\n\n**Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $60,159 and $61,977 in its operating bank account, respectively, and had a working capital deficiency of $7,266,566 and $4,204,802, respectively.\n\nThe Company’s liquidity needs to date have been satisfied through a payment of $25,000 from the Sponsor to purchase the Founder Shares, an initial loan of $165,340 from the Sponsor, and the proceeds from the consummation of the Private Placement not held in the Trust Account of $2.2 million. The Company repaid the initial loan from the Sponsor in full on December 6, 2021. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company Working Capital Loans (as defined in Note 5). As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 there were no amounts outstanding under any Working Capital Loans.\n\nOn June 20, 2023, the Company entered into a Promissory Note, (as defined in Note 5) with the Sponsor pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company up to an aggregate principal amount of up to $1,500,000. The Promissory Note is payable on the earlier of the date on which the Company consummates a Business Combination or June 7, 2024. On May 30, 2024, the Promissory Note was amended to extend the maturity date to December 7, 2024. Upon the consummation of the Business Combination, the Sponsor will have the option, but not the obligation, to convert the entire principal balance of the Promissory Note, in whole or in part, into private placement warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The terms of such private placement warrants (if issued) will be identical to the terms of the private placement warrants issued by the Company in connection with the IPO. The Promissory Note is subject to customary events of default, the occurrence of any of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal and interest balance of the Promissory Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Sponsor Note becoming immediately due and payable. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal balance including interest under the Promissory Note amounted to an aggregate of $1,461,675 and 1,095,833, respectively.\n\nOn August 3, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to TNL Mediagene with a principal amount available of up to $400,000, which was later amended and restated on July 15, 2024 to increase the aggregate principal amount available for drawdowns to up to $650,000 (as amended and restated, the “TNL Working Capital Note”). Borrowings under the TNL Working Capital Note are available on a monthly basis in increments of at least $25,000 and no more than $32,000 for any individual month and for any earlier individual months in which no borrowings were requested during the term of the TNL Working Capital Note. For the avoidance of doubt, requests by the Company to TNL Mediagene for borrowings under the TNL Mediagene Working Capital Note corresponding to months in which the Company did not previously request any borrowings are permitted to exceed $32,000 in aggregate. The monthly borrowings will be available until the earlier of (i) December 7, 2024, (ii) the date of consummation of the Merger, (iii) termination of the Merger Agreement and (iv) termination of the note by TNL Mediagene upon thirty days written notice by the Company. The TNL Working Capital Note is a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note that will not be repaid in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to consummation of the Business Combination. The TNL Working Capital Note will be paid on the date on which the Company consummates the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The TNL Working Capital Note is subject to events of default, the occurrence of any of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal and interest balance of the Promissory Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Sponsor Note becoming immediately due and payable. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal balance under the TNL Working Capital Note amounted to an aggregate of $249,906 and $149,946, respectively. \n\nOn April 5, 2024, the Company entered into a promissory note with the Sponsor pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company a principal amount of up to $750,000 (the “Sponsor Promissory Note”). The Sponsor Promissory Note is a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note which may be drawn down by the Company from time to time to be used for costs and expenses related to the Company’s initial merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company and one or more businesses or entities. Pursuant to the terms of the Sponsor Promissory Note, if the Business Combination is not consummated, the Sponsor Promissory Note will be repaid solely to the extent that the Company has funds available to it outside of its Trust Account, and that all other amounts will be contributed to capital, forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. The Sponsor Promissory Note is subject to events of default, the occurrence of any of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal of the Sponsor Promissory Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Sponsor Note becoming immediately due and payable. As of June 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance under the Sponsor Promissory Note amounted to an aggregate of $425,306.\n\n9\n\nIn accordance with the Extension Amendment, on January 2, 2024, February 2, 2024, March 1, 2024, April 1, 2024 and May 1, 2024, the Company deposited $60,000 into the Trust Account in order to effect additional one month extensions, which extended the deadline to June 7, 2024 to consummate the Business Combination. In accordance with the Second Extension Amendment, on June 3, 2024, July 24, 2024 and August 1, 2024, the Company deposited $30,000 into the Trust account, which extended the deadline to September 7, 2024.\n\nBased on the foregoing, management believes that the Company will have sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity from TNL Mediagene, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company’s officers and directors to meet its needs through the consummation of a Business Combination. Over this time period, the Company will be using these funds for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination.\n\nThe provisions of FASB ASC Topic 205-40, _Presentation of Financial Statements_ – Going Concern, requires management to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. The Company has until December 7, 2024, to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by the specified period. If a Business Combination is not consummated by December 7, 2024, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution\n\nThe Company’s evaluation of its liquidity condition and the date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern through December 7, 2024. These condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\n\n**Risks and Uncertainties**\n\nManagement is currently evaluating the impact of rising interest rates, inflation, the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in Israel and Palestine on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that any of these could have a negative effect on the Company’s financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these unaudited condensed financial statements. The unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\n**Inflation Reduction Act of 2022**\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IR Act”) was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. Because we may acquire a domestic corporation or engage in a transaction in which a domestic corporation becomes our parent or our affiliate and our securities trade on US stock exchange, we may become a “covered corporation” within the meaning of the IR Act. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax.\n\n10\n\n**NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\n**Basis of Presentation**\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results and cash flows for the periods presented.\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Current Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024. The interim results for the six months ended June 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024 or for any future interim periods.\n\n**Emerging Growth Company**\n\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\n\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company, which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\n\n**Use of Estimates**\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\n\n11\n\n**Concentration of Credit Risk**\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Coverage of $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on this account and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account.\n\n**Cash Held in Trust Account**\n\nAt June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all of the assets held in the Trust Account were held in a demand deposit account. Prior to November 2023, the Trust Account was invested in marketable securities and money market funds.\n\n**Cash and Cash Equivalents**\n\nThe Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company had $60,159 and $61,977 in cash held in its operating account as of June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.\n\n**Income Taxes**\n\nThe Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\n\nASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position.\n\nThere is currently no taxation imposed on income by the Government of the Cayman Islands. In accordance with Cayman income tax regulations, income taxes are not levied on the Company. Consequently, income taxes are not reflected in the Company’s financial statements. The Company’s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.\n\n**Fair Value of Financial Instruments**\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” (“ASC 820”) approximates the carrying amounts represented in the condensed balance sheets, primarily due to their short-term nature.\n\n12\n\n**Fair Value Measurements**\n\nThe Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually.\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities).\n\nThe following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities:\n\nLevel 1:| Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.  \n---|---  \nLevel 2:| Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.  \n---|---  \nLevel 3:| Unobservable inputs based on our assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  \n---|---  \n  \nIn some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n\n**Derivative Financial Instruments**\n\nThe Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”). For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value on the grant date and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\n\n**Warrant Liabilities**\n\nThe Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815. The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments, meet the definition of a liability, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own ordinary shares, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.\n\n13\n\nFor issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statement of operations.\n\nThe Company evaluated the Public Warrants (as defined in Note 7) and the Private Placement Warrants (collectively, the “Warrants”) in accordance with ASC 815, and concluded that a provision in the warrant agreement, dated December 2, 2021 (the “Warrant Agreement”) related to certain tender or exchange offers precludes the Warrants from being accounted for as components of equity. As the Warrants meet the definition of a derivative as contemplated in ASC 815, the Warrants are recorded as derivative liabilities on the condensed balance sheets and measured at fair value at inception (on the date of the IPO) and at each reporting date in accordance with ASC 820 with changes in fair value recognized in the condensed statement of operations in the period of change.\n\n**Offering Costs Associated with the Public Offering**\n\nThe Company complies with the requirements of ASC 340-10-S99-1, SEC Staff Accounting bulletin Topic 5A – “Expenses of Offering”, and SEC Staff Accounting bulletin Topic 5T – “Accounting for Expenses or Liabilities Paid by Principal Stockholder(s)”. Offering costs consist principally of professional and registration fees incurred through the balance sheet date that are related to the IPO. Offering costs directly attributable to the issuance of an equity contract to be classified in equity are recorded as a reduction of equity. Offering costs for equity contracts that are classified as assets and liabilities are expensed immediately. The Company incurred offering costs amounting to $12,517,335 as a result of the Public Offering (consisting of $3,795,000 of underwriting fees, $6,641,250 of deferred underwriting fees, $1,248,100 for the excess fair value of Founder Shares attributable to the Anchor Investor, and $832,985 of other offering costs). The Company recorded $10,788,729 of offering costs as a reduction of equity in connection with the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units. The Company immediately expensed $480,506 of offering costs in connection with the Warrants that were classified as liabilities.\n\n**Class A Shares Subject to Possible Redemption**\n\nThe Company accounts for its Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC 480. Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption are classified as a liability instrument and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders’ equity. The Company’s Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption is presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders’ deficit section of the Company’s condensed balance sheets.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount of Class A ordinary shares reflected on the balance sheet are reconciled in the following table:\n\nClass A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption as of December 31, 2022 | $| 196,226,283  \n---|---|---  \nPlus  \nAdjust carrying value to initial redemption value | 7,774,907  \nLess  \nShares redeemed in September 2023 | (136,786,445| )  \nClass A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption as of December 31, 2023 | $| 67,214,745  \nPlus  \nAdjust carrying value to initial redemption value | 1,056,674  \nLess  \nClass A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption as of March 31, 2024 | 68,271,419  \nPlus  \nAdjust carrying value to initial redemption value | 861,333  \nLess  \nShares redeemed in June 2024 | (48,321,747| )  \nClass A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption as of June 30, 2024 | $| 20,811,005  \n  \n14\n\n**Net Income (loss) Per Ordinary Share**\n\nBasic income (loss) per ordinary share is computed by dividing net income applicable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Consistent with ASC 480, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption, as well as their pro rata share of undistributed trust earnings consistent with the two-class method, have been excluded from the calculation of income per ordinary share for the six months ended June 30, 2024. Such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of trust earnings. Diluted income per share includes the incremental number of ordinary shares to be issued to settle warrants, as calculated for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The Company did not have any dilutive warrants, securities or other contracts that could potentially be exercised or converted into ordinary shares. As a result, diluted income per ordinary share is the same as income (loss) per ordinary share for all periods presented.\n\nA reconciliation of net income (loss) per ordinary share is as follows:\n\nFor the Three Months ended June 30, 2024 | For the Three Months ended June 30, 2023  \n---|---  \nClass A – Subject to Redemption | Class A and Class B – non-Redeemable | Class A – Subject to Redemption | Class B  \nEPS  \nNumerator: Net Income (Loss)  \nAllocation of net income (loss) | $| (492,938| ) | $| (470,337| ) | $| 719,552 | $| 179,888  \nDenominator: Weighted Average share  \nBasic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding | 4,971,703 | 4,743,750 | 18,975,000 | 4,743,750  \nBasic and diluted net income (loss) per ordinary share | $| (0.10| ) | $| (0.10| ) | $| 0.04 | $| 0.04  \nFor the Six Months ended June 30, 2024 | For the Six Months ended June 30, 2023  \n---|---  \nClass A – Subject to Redemption | Class A and Class B – Non-redeemable | Class A – Subject to Redemption | Class B  \nEPS  \nNumerator: Net Income (Loss)  \nAllocation of net income (loss) | $| (571,955| ) | $| (487,596| ) | $| 2,031,274 | $| 507,818  \nDenominator: Weighted Average share  \nBasic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding | 5,564,459 | 4,743,750 | 18,975,000 | 4,743,750  \nBasic and diluted net income (loss) per ordinary share | $| (0.10| ) | $| (0.10| ) | $| 0.11 | $| 0.11  \n  \nThe Class A ordinary shares issued upon conversion of the founder Class B ordinary shares are non-redeemable (see Note 8).\n\n**Stock Compensation Expense**\n\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”). Under ASC 718, stock-based compensation associated with equity-classified awards is measured at fair value upon the grant date and recognized over the requisite service period. To the extent a stock-based award is subject to a performance condition, the amount of expense recorded in a given period, if any, reflects an assessment of the probability of achieving such performance condition, with compensation recognized once the event is deemed probable to occur. Forfeitures are recognized as incurred. The Company has not recognized any stock-based compensation expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\n**Accounting Standards Recently Implemented**\n\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06 Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815–40) (“ASU 2020-06”). ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity’s own equity. The ASU is part of the FASB’s simplification initiative, which aims to reduce unnecessary complexity in GAAP. The ASU’s amendments are effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2024. The Company’s management does not believe that the adoption of ASU 2020-06 had a material impact on the Company’s unaudited condensed financial statements and disclosures.\n\n**Recently Issued Accounting Standards**\n\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.\n\n15\n\n**NOTE 3. PUBLIC OFFERING**\n\nPursuant to the Public Offering, the Company sold 16,500,000 Units at $10.00 per Unit. On December 9, 2021, the underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option and purchased 2,475,000 Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $24,750,000. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, $0.0001 par value, and one-half of one redeemable warrant. Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share (see Note 7).\n\nAn Anchor Investor unaffiliated with any member of our management team purchased an aggregate of 1,895,602 of the Units sold in the Public Offering. These Units purchased by Apollo in this offering are not subject to any agreements restricting their transfer. Further, Apollo purchased 175,000 founder shares at $0.0058 per share.\n\nThe Company considers the excess fair value of the Founder Shares issued to the Anchor Investor above the purchase price as offering costs and will reduce the gross proceeds by this amount. The Company has valued the excess fair value over consideration of the founder shares offered to the Anchor Investor at $1,248,100. The excess of the fair value over consideration of the Founder Shares was determined to be an offering cost in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A and 5T and were allocated to shareholders’ equity and expenses upon the completion of the Public Offering.\n\n**NOTE 4. PRIVATE PLACEMENT**\n\nSimultaneously with the closing of Public Offering, the Sponsor and Anchor Investor purchased an aggregate of 8,235,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. On December 9, 2021, the Company consummated the sale of additional 990,000 Private Placement Warrants with the Sponsor at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of $990,000.\n\nEach Private Placement Warrant is identical to the warrants offered in the Public Offering, except there is no redemption rights or liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to Private Placement Warrants, which will expire worthless if we do not consummate a Business Combination within the Combination Period. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants were added to the net proceeds from the Public Offering held in the Trust Account.\n\n**NOTE 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**\n\n**Founder Shares**\n\nOn March 26, 2021, the Company issued an aggregate of 4,312,500 Class B ordinary shares (the “Founder Shares”) to the Sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. On December 2, 2021, the Company effected a share capitalization of an additional 431,250 Class B ordinary shares, resulting in an aggregate of 4,743,750 Class B ordinary shares outstanding. All share and per-share amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect the share capitalization. \n\nOn June 21, 2024, the Company issued an aggregate of 4,353,749 Class A ordinary shares to the Sponsor upon the conversion of an equal number of Class B ordinary shares and an aggregate of 390,000 Class A ordinary shares to Norman Pearlstine, Joel Motley, Matt Goldberg, Priscilla Han, Apollo Credit Strategies Master Fund Ltd. and other holders of the Company's Class B ordinary shares upon the conversion of an equal number of Class B ordinary shares. The Class A ordinary shares issued in connection with the Conversion are subject to the same restrictions applicable to the Class B ordinary shares prior to the Conversion, including, among other things, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of an initial business combination. Following the Conversion, the Company had a total of 6,585,699 Class A ordinary shares outstanding, of which 1,841,950 were redeemable Class A ordinary shares, and one Class B ordinary share outstanding.\n\n16\n\nThe Sponsor and Anchor Investor have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of its Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) one year after the completion of a Business Combination or (B) subsequent to our initial Business Combination (x) if the last reported sale price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, share dividends, rights issuances, consolidations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and other similar transactions) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial Business Combination or (y) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of our Public Shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property.\n\nThe Anchor Investor has not been granted any shareholder or other rights in addition to those afforded to the Company’s other public shareholders. Further, the Anchor Investor is not required to (i) hold any Units, Class A ordinary shares or warrants purchased in the Public Offering or thereafter for any amount of time, (ii) vote any Class A ordinary shares they may own at the applicable time in favor of the Business Combination or (iii) refrain from exercising their right to redeem their public shares at the time of the Business Combination. The Anchor Investor has the same rights to the funds held in the Trust Account with respect to the Class A ordinary shares underlying the Units they purchased in the Public Offering as the rights afforded to the Company’s other public shareholders.\n\n**Related Party Loans**\n\nIn order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Company’s Sponsor, an affiliate of the Sponsor, or the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (the “Working Capital Loans”). Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of notes may be converted upon consummation of a Business Combination into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. There are no Working Capital Loans outstanding as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\n**Convertible Promissory Note**\n\nOn June 20, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured convertible promissory note (the “ Promissory Note”) to the Sponsor for borrowings from time to time of up to an aggregate of $1,500,000 which may be drawn by the Company to finance costs incurred in connection with a potential initial business combination and for working capital purposes and/or to finance monthly deposits into the Trust Account for each public share that is not redeemed in connection with the extension of the Company’s termination date from September 7, 2023 to June 7, 2024. On May 30, 2024, in connection with the extension of the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination from July 7, 2024, to December 7, 2024, the Promissory Note was amended to provide for payment on the earlier of the date on which the Company consummates a Business Combination or December 7, 2024. The Promissory Note is interest bearing, at the applicable federal interest rate, compounded per annum, and is payable on the earlier of (i) December 7, 2024; (ii) the date on which the Company consummates a Business Combination or (iii) the Company liquidates the Trust Account upon the failure to consummate an initial business combination within the requisite time period. Upon consummation of the Company’s initial business combination, the Promissory Note may be converted, at the Sponsor’s discretion, into private placement warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal balance including interest under the Promissory Note amounted to an aggregate of $1,461,675 and $1,095,833, respectively. Interest expense amounted to $31,327 and $33,958 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. There was no interest incurred during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.\n\n**Sponsor Promissory Note**\n\nOn April 5, 2024, the Company entered into a promissory note with the Sponsor pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company a principal amount equal to $750,000 (the “Sponsor Promissory Note”). The Sponsor Promissory Note is a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note which may be drawn down by the Company from time to time to be used for costs and expenses related to the Company’s initial merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company and one or more businesses or entities. Pursuant to the terms of the Sponsor Promissory Note, if the Business Combination is not consummated, the Sponsor Promissory Note will be repaid solely to the extent that the Company has funds available to it outside of its Trust Account, and that all other amounts will be contributed to capital, forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven or eliminated. The Sponsor Promissory Note is subject to events of default, the occurrence of any of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal of the Sponsor Promissory Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Sponsor Note becoming immediately due and payable. As of June 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance under the Sponsor Promissory Note amounted to $425,306.\n\n**Administrative Support Agreement**\n\nOn December 2, 2021, the Company entered into an administrative support agreement with the Sponsor pursuant to which, until the Company’s initial business combination or liquidation, the Company may reimburse an affiliate of the Sponsor up to an amount of $10,000 per month for office space and secretarial and administrative support (the “Administrative Support Agreement”). The Company recognized $30,000 and $60,000 of expense, for each of the three- and six month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which are included in “General and administrative expenses” in the accompanying condensed statements of operations. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 a total of $290,000 and $230,000, respectively are included in “Accounts payable and accrued expenses”.\n\n17\n\n**Consulting Agreements**\n\nThe Company and Mr. Leggett entered into a consulting agreement on October 11, 2022, as amended July 31, 2023 (the “Leggett Consulting Agreement”). Under the Leggett Consulting Agreement, Mr. Leggett is entitled to $20,000 per month for certain services Mr. Leggett provides to the Company and its affiliates. Mr. Leggett is separately entitled under the Leggett Consulting Agreement to a success bonus of $250,000 to be paid within 10 business days of the close of the business combination, subject to a reduction by $17,500 for each month in which the Company pays Mr. Leggett a consulting service fee under the Leggett Consulting Agreement. The Company and Mr. Lasov entered into a consulting agreement on November 22, 2022, as amended July 31, 2023 (the “Lasov Consulting Agreement”). Under the Lasov Consulting Agreement, Mr. Lasov is entitled to $32,500 per month for certain services Mr. Lasov provides to the Company and its affiliates. Mr. Lasov is separately entitled under the Lasov Consulting Agreement to a success bonus of $150,000 to be paid within 10 business days of the close of the business combination, subject to a reduction by the amount of each consulting service fee paid to Mr. Lasov by the Company under the Lasov Consulting Agreement. Mr. Lasov has agreed that as of February 1, 2024, he will not be invoicing the Company for services performed under the Lasov Consulting Agreement with the Company. Mr. Leggett has agreed that as of April 1, 2024, he will reduce his monthly service fee under the Leggett Consulting Agreement to $5,000. The Company recognized an aggregate expense of $112,500 and $270,000, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, which are included in “General and administrative” expenses in the accompanying condensed statements of operations. The aggregate amount due of $167,500 and $52,500 are included in “Accounts payable and accrued expenses” on the accompanying condensed balance sheets at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nThere were no consulting fees incurred during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, related to these consulting agreements.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company is no longer obligated to pay a success bonus upon the consummation of a business combination, as the amounts previously expensed under these agreements have exceeded the bonus amounts.\n\n**NOTE 6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**\n\n**Registration Rights**\n\nThe holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and any warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans (and in each case holders of their component securities, as applicable) are entitled to registration rights pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, effective December 2, 2021, which requires the Company to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to our Class A ordinary shares). The holders of the majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the consummation of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\n\n**Underwriter’s Agreement**\n\nThe Company paid a cash underwriting discount of 2.00% of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering, or $3,795,000 due to the exercise of the over-allotment option in full. In addition, the underwriter is entitled to a deferred fee of three and a half percent (3.50%) of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering, or $6,641,250. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. The underwriter has reimbursed the Company for $550,000 for offering expenses. The reimbursement of these costs has been accounted for as a reduction to offering costs of the Public Offering.\n\n**NOTE 7. WARRANTS**\n\nThe Company accounted for the 18,712,500 warrants issued in connection with the Public Offering (the 9,487,500 Public Warrants and the 9,225,000 Private Placement Warrants) in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815. Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each warrant much be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, the Company has classified each warrant as a liability at its fair value. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the Company’s statement of operations.\n\n**_Warrants -_** Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants will become exercisable 30 days after the consummation of a Business Combination. The Public Warrants will expire five years from the consummation of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.\n\n18\n\nThe Company will not be obligated to deliver any Class A ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a Public Warrant and will have no obligation to settle such Public Warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration. No Public Warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their Public Warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available.\n\nThe Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days, after the closing of a Business Combination, it will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement registering the issuance, under the Securities Act, of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants, to cause such registration statement to become effective and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the Warrant Agreement. If a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th business day after the closing of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption.\n\n**_Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $ 18.00. _**\n\nOnce the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the Warrants for redemption:\n\n●| in whole and not in part;  \n---|---  \n●| at a price of $0.01 per Public Warrant;  \n---|---  \n●| upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder and  \n---|---  \n●| if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company will not redeem the warrants as described above unless an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares is available throughout the 30-day redemption period. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, the Company may exercise its redemption right even if the Company is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.\n\n**_Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $ 10.00._**\n\nOnce the Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the Warrants for redemption:\n\n●| in whole and not in part;  \n---|---  \n●| at $0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption provided that holders will be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares determined by reference to the table based on the redemption date and the “fair market value” of our Class A ordinary shares;  \n---|---  \n● | if, and only if, the Reference Value (as defined above under “Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $18.00”) equals or exceeds $10.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant); and  \n---|---  \n● | if the Reference Value is less than $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant), the Private Placement Warrants must also concurrently be called for redemption on the same terms as the outstanding Public Warrants, as described above.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf and when the Public Warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may not exercise its redemption right if the issuance of shares of ordinary shares upon exercise of the warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or the Company is unable to effect such registration or qualification. \n\n19\n\nThe exercise price and number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Public Warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless. If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the Warrant Agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless.\n\nIn addition, if (x) the Company issues additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of its initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of Class A ordinary shares (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company’s board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the Sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the “Newly Issued Price”), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the Company’s initial Business Combination on the date of the consummation of such initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price and the $18.00 per share redemption trigger price described above will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the greater of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.\n\nThe Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants included in the Units sold in the Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants and the shares of ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants are not transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis and are non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.\n\n**NOTE 8. SHAREHOLDERS’ DEFICIT**\n\n**_Preferred Shares_** -The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value, preferred shares. On June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no preferred shares issued or outstanding.\n\n**_Class A Ordinary shares_** -The Company is authorized to issue up to 200,000,000 Class A, $0.0001 par value, ordinary shares. Holders of the Company’s ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share.\n\n**_Class B Ordinary shares_** -The Company is authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 Class B, $0.0001 par value, ordinary shares. Holders of the Company’s ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share. On December 2, 2021, the Company effected a share capitalization of an additional 431,250 Class B ordinary shares, resulting in an aggregate of 4,743,750 Class B ordinary shares outstanding.\n\nHolders of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all other matters submitted to a vote of shareholders, except as required by law; provided that only holders of Class B ordinary shares have the right to vote for the election of directors prior to the Company’s initial Business Combination.\n\nThe Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of the initial Business Combination, or earlier at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for share sub-divisions, share dividends, rights issuances, consolidations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like, and subject to further adjustment as provided herein. In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts issued and related to the closing of the initial Business Combination, the ratio at which the Class B ordinary shares will convert into Class A ordinary shares will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding Class B ordinary shares agree to waive such anti-dilution adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Class B ordinary shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of all shares issued and outstanding plus all Class A ordinary shares and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the initial Business Combination, excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial Business Combination. The term “equity-linked securities” refers to any debt or equity securities that are convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for the Company’s Class A ordinary shares issued in a financing transaction in connection with the initial business combination, including but not limited to a private placement of equity or debt.\n\n20\n\nOn June 21, 2024, pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company, the Sponsor and certain directors, of the Company elected to convert an aggregate of 4,353,749 and 390,000, respectively, of outstanding Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share on a one-for-one basis into non-redeemable Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share of the Company, with immediate effect. The non-redeemable Class A Ordinary Shares issued in connection with the conversion are subject to the same restrictions as applied to the Class B ordinary shares before the conversion, including, and among other things, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of a Business Combination as described in the prospectus for the Company’s IPO. The Company modified its balance sheet and statements of shareholders’ equity to reflect the impact of these conversions. Following such conversion, as of June 30, 2024, the Company had an aggregate of 4,743,749 non-redeemable Class A ordinary shares and one Class B ordinary share issued and outstanding.\n\nPursuant to and concurrently with the Public Offering, the Company sold 18,975,000 Units. In connection with the Extraordinary General Meeting and Second Extension Meeting, the shareholders of record were provided the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights. On June 3, 2024 and September 5, 2023, holders of 4,315,265 and 12,817,785 Class A ordinary shares, respectively, exercised their right to redemption. Following the redemptions, as of June 30, 2024, the Company had a total of 1,841,950 Class A ordinary shares outstanding subject to possible redemption (see Note 2).\n\n**NOTE 9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS**\n\nThe following table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis on June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value:\n\n**June 30, 2024** | **Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1)** | **Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)** | **Significant Other Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)**  \n---|---|---|---  \nAssets:  \nCash held in Trust Account | $ | 20,811,005 | $ | 20,811,005 | $ | — | $ | —  \nLiabilities:  \nWarrant liabilities – Public Warrants | $ | 147,056 | $ | — | $ | 147,056 | $ | —  \nWarrant liabilities – Private Placement Warrants | $ | 142,988 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 142,988  \nDecember 31, 2023 | **Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1)** | **Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)** | **Significant Other Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)**  \n---|---|---|---  \nAssets:  \nMarketable securities held in Trust Account | $ | 67,214,745 | $ | 67,214,745 | $ | — | $ | —  \nLiabilities:  \nWarrant liabilities – Public Warrants | $ | 189,750 | $ | — | $ | 189,750 | $ | —  \nWarrant liabilities – Private Placement Warrants | $ | 184,500 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 184,500  \n  \nThe Warrants are accounted for as liabilities in accordance with ASC 815 and are presented within warrant liabilities on the condensed balance sheets. The warrant liabilities are measured at fair value at inception and on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented within change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the condensed statements of operations. Transfers to/from Levels 1, 2 and 3 are recognized at the beginning of the reporting period in which a change in valuation technique or methodology occurs.\n\nThe Private Placement Warrants were valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is considered to be a Level 3 fair value measurement. The key inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the Private Placement Warrants were as follows as of June 30, 2024:\n\nInput | June 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---|---  \nRisk-free interest rate | — | —  \nExpected term (years) | 4.5 | 4.78  \nExpected volatility | — | —  \nExercise price | $| 11.50 | $| 11.50  \nFair value of Class A ordinary shares | $| 11.16 | $| 10.78  \n  \n21\n\nThe Company’s use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model required the use of subjective assumptions:\n\n●| The risk-free interest rate assumption was based on the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rate for the expected term of the warrants.  \n---|---  \n●| The expected term was determined utilizing a probability weighted term input to be consistent with the stock price and volatility inputs which are reflective of the probability of successful merger.  \n---|---  \n●| The expected volatility assumption was based on the implied volatility solved by calibrating the warrant value output from a Binomial Lattice based model to the publicly observed, traded price on each valuation date. An increase in the expected volatility, in isolation, would result in an increase in the fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities and vice versa.  \n---|---  \n●| The fair value of one Class A ordinary share is the publicly-traded stock price.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe following table presents the changes in the fair value of the Company’s Level 3 financial instruments that are measured at fair value:\n\nFair value as of December 31, 2022 | $| 691,875  \n---|---|---  \nChange in fair value | 139,298  \nFair value as of March 31, 2023 | $| 831,173  \nChange in fair value | (433,575| )  \nFair value as of June 30, 2023 | $| 397,598  \nChange in fair value | 119,925  \nFair value as of September 30, 2023 | $| 517,523  \nChange in fair value | (333,023| )  \nFair value as of December 31, 2023 | $| 184,500  \nChange in fair value | (7,380| )  \nFair value as of March 31, 2024 | $| 177,120  \nChange in fair value | (34,132| )  \nFair value as of June 30, 2024 | $| 142,988  \n  \n**NOTE 10. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**\n\nManagement of the Company evaluated events that have occurred after the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were issued. Based upon this review, other than below, management did not identify any recognized or non-recognized subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.\n\nIn accordance with the Second Extension Amendment, on July 24 and August 1, 2024, the Company deposited $30,000 into the Trust account, which extended the deadline to September 7, 2024.\n\nOn July 15, 2024, the Company and TNL Mediagene amended the TNL Mediagene Working Capital Note, to increase borrowings available under the note from $400,000 to $650,000, such borrowings to be available in monthly increments of at least $25,000 and no more than $32,000 for fund expenses incurred in connection with the Merger.

On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the parties thereto will enter into a business combination transaction (the “Business Combination” and together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Transactions”), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into us, with us surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of TNL Mediagene (the “Merger”).\n\nAt the closing of the Transactions (the “Closing”), by virtue of the Merger, our outstanding shares and warrants will be canceled and converted into the right to receive equivalent shares and warrants of TNL Mediagene, and TNL Mediagene is expected to be the publicly traded company with its ordinary shares and warrants listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”).\n\nWe intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of the Public Offering, the sale of the Private Placement Warrants and the Additional Private Placement Warrants, our capital shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt. The Company is an “emerging growth company”, and as such, the Company is subject to all risks associated with emerging growth companies.\n\nOn August 29, 2023, shareholders of the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the “Extraordinary General Meeting”) in lieu of the 2023 annual general meeting of the shareholders of the Company. At the Extraordinary General Meeting, the Company’s shareholders approved the proposal to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to give the Company the right to extend the date by which it has to consummate a business combination from September 7, 2023 to June 7, 2024, by depositing into the Trust Account $60,000 for each of the nine subsequent one-month extensions. In connection therewith the shareholders of record were provided the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights (the “Extension Amendment”). Holders of 12,817,785 Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redemption at a per share redemption price of approximately $10.67. On September 5, 2023, a total of $136,786,445 in redemption payments were made in connection with this redemption. Following the redemption, the Company had a total of 6,157,215 Class A ordinary shares outstanding\n\n23\n\nOn May 29, 2024, shareholders of the Company held an Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders in lieu of the 2024 annual general meeting of the shareholders of the company (the “Second Extension Meeting”).

In connection therewith the shareholders of record were provided the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights (the “Second Extension Amendment”). Holders of 4,315,265 Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redemption at a per share redemption price of approximately $11.20. On June 3, 2024, a total of $48,321,747 in redemption payments were made in connection with the Second Extension Amendment.

The Class A ordinary shares issued in connection with the Conversion are subject to the same restrictions applicable to the Class B ordinary shares prior to the Conversion, including, among other things, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of an initial\n\nbusiness combination. Following the Conversion, the Company had a total of 6,585,699 Class A ordinary shares outstanding, of which 1,841,950 were redeemable Class A ordinary shares, and one Class B ordinary share outstanding.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had cash of $60,159 and had a working capital deficit of $7,266,566. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to complete a business combination will be successful.\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\nWe did not commence operations until after the closing of our Public Offering in December 2021, and as of June 30, 2024, we have not engaged in any significant operations nor generated any operating revenues to date. We will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial Business Combination. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents. There has been no significant change in our financial or trading position and no material adverse change has occurred since the date of our audited financial statements. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.\n\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, we had net losses of $963,275 and $1,059,551, respectively, which were impacted by the change in fair value of warrant liability of $69,236 and $84,206, respectively, interest expense of $31,327 and $33,958, respectively, and interest earned on cash held in trust account of $711,332 and $1,588,06, respectively and a loss from operations of $1,712,516 and $2,697,805, respectively.\n\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2023, we had net income of $899,440, which was impacted by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $1,740,574, change in fair value of warrant liability of $879,488, unrealized gain on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $577,612 and a loss from operations of $2,298,234.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2023, we had net income of $2,539,092 which was impacted by interest earned on marketable securities held in the trust account of $3,878,696, change in fair value of warrant liability of $596,929, unrealized gain on marketable securities held in the trust account of $670,104, and a loss from operations of $2,606,637.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nOn December 7, 2021, we consummated our Public Offering of 16,500,000 Units and the Private Placement of an aggregate of 8,235,000 private placement warrants, generating gross proceeds of $173,235,000. On December 9, 2021, the Underwriter exercised in full the option granted to them by the Company to purchase up to 2,475,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, and we issued an additional 990,000 Private Placement Warrants in the Additional Private Placement, generating total gross proceeds of $25,245,000.\n\nFollowing our Public Offering, the exercise of the over-allotment option and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, a total of $193,545,000 was placed in the Trust Account. We incurred $12,517,335 in transaction costs, including $3,795,000 in cash underwriting fees, $6,641,250 of deferred underwriting fees, $1,248,100 of offering costs related to the fair value of the Founder Shares sold to Apollo, and $832,985 of other offering costs.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was $528,968. Net loss of $1,059,551 was impacted by interest earned on cash held the Trust Account of $1,588,006, change in fair value of warrant liability of $84,206, interest expense of $33,958 and changes in operating assets and liabilities, $2,168,837.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had cash of $20,811,005 and $67,214,745 held in the Trust Account, respectively. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less taxes paid and deferred underwriting commissions) to complete our initial Business Combination. We may withdraw interest to pay taxes.\n\n24\n\nAs of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash of $60,159 and $61,977 outside of the Trust Account, respectively. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete our initial Business Combination.\n\nIn connection with Extraordinary General Meeting on August 29, 2023, the shareholders of record were provided the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights. Holders of 12,817,785 Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redemption, subsequently a total of $136,786,445 in redemption payments were made in connection with this redemption from the Trust Account. In connection with the Second Extension Meeting on May 29, 2024, the shareholders of record were provided with the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights. Holders of 4,315,265 Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redemption, subsequently a total of $48,321,747 in redemption payments were made in connection with this redemption from the Trust Account. Following these redemptions, the Company had a total of 1,841,950 Class A ordinary shares outstanding. On June 21, 2024, the Company issued an aggregate of 4,353,749 Class A ordinary shares to the Sponsor upon the conversion of an equal number of Class B ordinary shares and an aggregate of 390,000 Class A ordinary shares to Norman Pearlstine, Joel Motley, Matt Goldberg, Priscilla Han, Apollo Credit Strategies Master Fund Ltd. and other holders of the Company’s Class B ordinary shares upon the conversion of an equal number of Class B ordinary shares. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, we did not withdraw any other interest earned on the Trust Account. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.\n\nIn addition, in order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial Business Combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. Otherwise, such loans may be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that our initial Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination company, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender.\n\nOn June 20, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured convertible promissory note (the “Promissory Note”) to the Sponsor for borrowings from time to time of up to an aggregate of $1,500,000 which may be drawn by the Company to finance costs incurred in connection with a potential initial business combination and for working capital purposes and/or to finance monthly deposits into the Trust Account for each public share that is not redeemed in connection with the extension of the Company’s termination date from September 7, 2023 to June 7, 2024. On May 30, 2024, in connection with the extension of the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination from July 7, 2024, to December 7, 2024, the Promissory Note was amended to provide for payment on the earlier of the date on which the Company consummates a Business Combination or December 7, 2024. The Promissory Note is interest bearing, at the applicable federal interest rate, compounded, per annum, and is payable on the earlier of (i) December 7, 2024; (ii) the date on which the Company consummates a Business Combination or (iii) the Company liquidates the Trust Account upon the failure to consummate an initial business combination within the requisite time period. Upon consummation of the Company’s initial business combination, the Promissory Note may be converted, at the Sponsor’s discretion, into private placement warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal balance including interest under the Promissory Note amounted to an aggregate of $1,461,675 and 1,095,833, respectively. Interest expense amounted to $31,327 and $33, 958 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. There was no interest incurred during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.\n\nOn August 3, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to TNL Mediagene with a principal amount available of up to $400,000, which was later amended and restated on July 15, 2024 to increase the aggregate principal amount available for drawdowns to up to $650,000 (as amended and restated, the “TNL Working Capital Note”). Borrowings under the TNL Working Capital Note are available on a monthly basis in increments of at least $25,000 and no more than $32,000. The monthly borrowings will be available until the earlier of (i) December 7, 2024, (ii) the date of consummation of the Merger, (iii) termination of the Merger Agreement and (iv) termination of the note by TNL Mediagene upon thirty days written notice by the Company. The TNL Working Capital Note is a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note that will not be repaid in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to consummation of the Business Combination. The TNL Working Capital Note will be paid on the date on which the Company consummates the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The following shall constitute an event of default under the TNL Working Capital Note: (i) a failure to pay the principal within five business days of the maturity date and (ii) the commencement of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy action. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the outstanding principal balance under the TNL Working Capital Note amounted to an aggregate of $249,906 and $149,946, respectively.\n\nOn April 5, 2024, the Company entered into a promissory note with the Sponsor pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company a principal amount equal to $750,000 (the “Sponsor Promissory Note”). The Sponsor Promissory Note is a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note which may be drawn down by the Company from time to time to be used for costs and expenses related to the Company’s initial merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company and one or more businesses or entities. Pursuant to the terms of the Sponsor Promissory Note, if the Business Combination is not consummated, the Sponsor Promissory Note will be repaid solely to the extent that the Company has funds available to it outside of its Trust Account, and that all other amounts will be contributed to capital, forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven or eliminated. The Sponsor Promissory Note is subject to events of default, the occurrence of any of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal of the Sponsor Promissory Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Sponsor Note becoming immediately due and payable. As of June 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance under the Sponsor Promissory Note amounted to $425,306.\n\n25\n\nBased on the foregoing, management believes that the Company will have sufficient working capital and borrowing capacity from the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company’s officers and directors to meet its needs through the earlier of the consummation of a Business Combination or one year from this filing. Over this time period, the Company will be using these funds for paying existing accounts payable, identifying and evaluating prospective initial Business Combination candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to merge with or acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination.\n\nFASB ASC Topic 205-40, _Presentation of Financial Statements_ – Going Concern requires management to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. The Company has until December 7, 2024, to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by the specified period. If a Business Combination is not consummated by December 7, 2024, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution\n\nThe Company’s evaluation of its liquidity condition and the date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern one year from the date that these condensed financial statements are issued. These condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\n\n**Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements**\n\nOn June 30, 2024, we did not have any obligations, assets or liabilities that would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations.\n\n**Contractual Obligations**\n\n _Administrative Support Agreement_\n\nOn December 2, 2021, the Company entered into an Administrative Support Agreement pursuant to which the Company may reimburse an affiliate of the Sponsor up to an amount of $10,000 per month for office space and secretarial and administrative support.\n\n_Registration Rights_\n\nThe holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and any warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans (and in each case holders of their component securities, as applicable) are entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement effective December 2, 2021, which requires the Company to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to our Class A ordinary shares). The holders of the majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the consummation of a business combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\n\n_Underwriter’s Agreement_\n\nThe Company paid a cash underwriting discount of 2.00% of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering, or $3,795,000 due to the exercise of the over-allotment option in full. In addition, the underwriter will be entitled to a deferred fee of three and a half percent (3.50%) of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering, or $6,641,250. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. The underwriter has reimbursed the Company for $550,000 for offering expenses. The reimbursement of these costs has been accounted for as a reduction to offering costs of the Public Offering.\n\n26\n\n _Consulting Agreements_\n\nThe Company and Mr. Leggett entered into a consulting agreement on October 11, 2022, as amended July 31, 2023 (the “Leggett Consulting Agreement”). Under the Leggett Consulting Agreement, Mr. Leggett is entitled to $20,000 per month for certain services Mr. Leggett provides to the Company and its affiliates. Mr. Leggett is separately entitled under the Leggett Consulting Agreement to a success bonus of $250,000 to be paid within 10 business days of the close of the business combination, subject to a reduction by $17,500 for each month in which the Company pays Mr. Leggett a consulting service fee under the Leggett Consulting Agreement. The Company and Mr. Lasov entered into a consulting agreement on November 22, 2022, as amended July 31, 2023 (the “Lasov Consulting Agreement”). Under the Lasov Consulting Agreement, Mr. Lasov is entitled to $32,500 per month for certain services Mr. Lasov provides to the Company and its affiliates. Mr. Lasov is separately entitled under the Lasov Consulting Agreement to a success bonus of $150,000 to be paid within 10 business days of the close of the business combination, subject to a reduction by the amount of each consulting service fee paid to Mr. Lasov by the Company under the Lasov Consulting Agreement. Mr. Lasov has agreed that as of February 1, 2024, he will not be invoicing the Company for services performed under the Lasov Consulting Agreement with the Company. Mr. Leggett has agreed that as of April 1, 2024, he will reduce his monthly service fee under the Leggett Consulting Agreement to $5,000. The Company recognized an aggregate expense of $112,500 and $270,000, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, which are included in “General and administrative” expenses in the accompanying condensed statements of operations. There were no consulting fees recognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. The aggregate amount due of $167,500 and $52,500 are included in “Accounts payable and accrued expenses” on the accompanying condensed balance sheets at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company is no longer obligated to pay a success bonus upon the consummation of a business combination, as the amounts previously expensed under these agreements have exceeded the bonus amounts.\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies**\n\nThis management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our unaudited financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our unaudited financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to fair value of financial instruments and accrued expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\n_Warrant Liabilities_\n\nThe Company accounts for the Warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the specific terms of the Warrants and the applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815. The assessment considers whether they are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the Warrants are indexed to the Company’s own ordinary shares and whether the holders of the Warrants could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of issuance of the Warrants and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the Warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, such warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, such warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of liability-classified warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statement of operations.\n\n_Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption_\n\nClass A ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Class A ordinary shares (including Class A ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Class A ordinary shares are classified as shareholders’ equity. Our Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 1,841,950 and 6,157,215, Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption, respectively, are presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders’ deficit section of the Company’s condensed balance sheets.\n\n27\n\n _Net Income (loss) Per Ordinary Share_\n\nBasic income (loss) per ordinary share is computed by dividing net income applicable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Consistent with ASC 480, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption, as well as their pro rata share of undistributed trust earnings consistent with the two-class method, have been excluded from the calculation of income per ordinary share for the six month period ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. Such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of trust earnings. Diluted income per share includes the incremental number of ordinary shares to be issued to settle warrants, as calculated using the treasury method. For the period from December 31, 2023 to June 30, 2024, the Company did not have any dilutive warrants, securities or other contracts that could potentially, be exercised or converted into ordinary shares. As a result, diluted income per ordinary share is the same as basic income (loss) per ordinary share for all periods presented.\n\n_Recently Adopted Accounting Standard_\n\nIn August 2020 the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06 Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815–40) (“ASU 2020-06”). ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity’s own equity. The ASU is part of the FASB’s simplification initiative, which aims to reduce unnecessary complexity in GAAP. The ASU’s amendments are effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2024. The Company’s management does not believe that the adoption of ASU 2020-06 had a material impact on the Company’s unaudited condensed financial statements and disclosures.\n\n_Recently Issued Accounting Standards_\n\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.\n\n_JOBS Act_\n\nOn April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected to irrevocably opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we will adopt the new or revised standard at the time public companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another emerging growth company that has not opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.\n\nAdditionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an “emerging growth company”, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive Officer’s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our Public Offering or until we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” whichever is earlier.\n\n28\n\n**Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.**\n\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item.\n\n**Item 4. Controls and Procedures.**\n\n_Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures_\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below.\n\nAs previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, that was filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024, our management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting due to the fact that we did not have the necessary business processes and related internal controls formally designed and implemented related to accrued expenses and accounts payable. As a result, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles including implementing the remediation activities as described below. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this Form 10-Q present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the period presented.\n\nDisclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\n_Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting_\n\n _Historical Remediation Activities_\n\nAs previously disclosed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, management identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting related to accrued expenses and accounts payable.\n\nThe Company has performed the following remediation activities to confirm its accounts payable obligations:\n\n●| We confirmed that no member of management or advisor providing services to the Company has unsubmitted or unreimbursed expenses or fees, and  \n---|---  \n●| we confirmed that the Company was current with its payables to its service providers.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe are committed to ensuring that our internal controls are designed and operating effectively. Management believes the efforts taken to date and the planned remediation will improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. While these remediation efforts are ongoing, the controls must also be operating effectively for a sufficient period of time and be tested by management in order to consider them remediated and conclude that the controls are operating effectively to address the risks of material misstatement.\n\nExcept for the steps taken as part of the remediation activities described above, there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the six months ended June 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n29\n\n**PART II - OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**Item 1. Legal Proceedings.**\n\nWe are not a party to any material legal proceedings and no material legal proceedings have been threatened by us or, to the best of our knowledge, against us.\n\n**Item 1A Risk Factors.**\n\nFactors that could cause our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition to differ materially from the descriptions provided in this report include the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024. In addition, the following risk factor could also have such an effect.\n\n**_A 1% U.S. federal excise tax may decrease the value of our securities following an initial business combination, or hinder our ability to consummate an initial business combination._**\n\nPursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IR Act”), commencing in 2023, a 1% U.S. federal excise tax is imposed on certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock by publicly traded domestic (i.e., U.S.) corporations and certain domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation and not on its shareholders. The amount of the excise tax is equal to 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. Although we are a Cayman Islands company, the excise tax may apply in connection with redemptions or other repurchases that occur in connection with an initial business combination that involves our combination with a U.S. entity and/or our domestication as a U.S. corporation (a “Redemption Event”). In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by us and not by the redeeming holders, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax remains to be determined. Any excise tax payable by us in connection with a Redemption Event may cause a reduction in the cash available to us to complete an initial business combination and could affect our ability to complete an initial business combination** _._**\n\n**_The SEC has recently issued final rules to regulate special purpose acquisition companies. Certain of the procedures that we, a potential business combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with such proposals may increase our costs and the time needed to complete our initial business combination and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete a business combination._**\n\nOn January 24, 2024, the SEC issued final rules (the “SPAC Rules”) relating to, among other things, disclosures in business combination transactions between special purpose acquisition companies (“SPACs”) such as us and private operating companies; the condensed financial statement requirements applicable to transactions involving shell companies; and the use of projections by SPACs in SEC filings in connection with proposed business combination transactions. The SPAC Rules became effective 125 days after their publication in the Federal Register. In connection with the issuance of the SPAC Rules, the SEC also issued guidance (the “SPAC Guidance”) regarding the potential liability of certain participants in proposed business combination transactions and the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“Investment Company Act”) based on certain facts and circumstances such as duration, asset composition, sources of income, business purpose and activities of the SPAC and its management team in furtherance of such goals.\n\nCertain of the procedures that we, a potential business combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with the SPAC Rules, or pursuant to the SEC’s views expressed in the SPAC Guidance, may increase the costs and the time required to consummate a business combination, and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete a business combination.\n\n**_If we were deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we may be forced to abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead be required to liquidate and dissolve the Company._**\n\nAs described above, the SPAC Guidance relates to, among other things, the circumstances in which SPACs such as us could potentially be subject to the Investment Company Act and the regulations thereunder. Whether a SPAC is an investment company will be a question of facts and circumstances under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act. A specific duration period of a SPAC is not the sole determinant, but one of the long-standing factors to consider in determination of a SPAC’s status under the Investment Company Act. A SPAC could be deemed as an investment company at any stage of its operation. The determination of a SPAC’s status as an investment company includes analysis of a SPAC’s activities, depending upon the facts and circumstances, including but not limited to, the nature of SPAC assets and income, the activities of a SPAC’s officers, directors and employees, the duration of a SPAC, the manner a SPAC holding itself out to investors, and the merging with an investment company.\n\n30\n\nIt is possible that a claim could be made that we have been operating as an unregistered investment company, including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, based on the current views of the SEC. If we were deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we might be forced to abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead be required to liquidate the Company. If we are required to liquidate the Company, our investors would not be able to realize the benefits of owning shares in a successor operating business, including the potential appreciation in the value of our shares and warrants following such a transaction, and our warrants would expire worthless.\n\nIn an effort to mitigate the risk that we may be deemed to have been operating as an unregistered investment company under the Investment Company Act, we instructed Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the trustee with respect to the Trust Account, to liquidate the U.S. government securities held in the Trust Account in November 2023 and to thereafter hold all funds in the Trust Account in an interest bearing demand deposit account until the earlier of the consummation of our Business Combination or our liquidation. There can be no assurance that this action will foreclose a judicial or regulatory finding, or an allegation, that the Company is an investment company.\n\n**_Termination of the Transactions could negatively impact Blue Ocean._**\n\nIf the Transactions are not completed for any reason, including as a result of our shareholders declining to approve the proposals required to effect the Transactions, our ongoing business may be adversely impacted and, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Transactions, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\n●| we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our share price (including to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Transactions will be completed);  \n---|---  \n●| we will have incurred substantial expenses and will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Transactions, whether or not the Transactions are completed; and  \n---|---  \n●| since the Merger Agreement restricts the conduct of our businesses prior to completion of the Merger, we may not be able to take certain actions during the pendency of the Merger that would benefit us as an independent company, and the opportunity to take such actions may no longer be available.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf the Transactions are terminated and our board of directors seeks another business combination target, our shareholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find another acquisition target that would constitute a business combination or that such other business combination will be completed.\n\n**_The Transactions may be more difficult, costly, or time-consuming than expected, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Transactions._**\n\nTo realize the anticipated benefits from the Transactions, we must successfully integrate and combine our business with that of TNL Mediagene. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the Transactions may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, the actual benefits of the Transactions could be less than anticipated, and integration may result in additional unforeseen expenses. In addition, we and TNL Mediagene have operated and, until the completion of the Transactions, must continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of one or more key employees, the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies that adversely affect each company’s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Transactions. Integration efforts between the companies may also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the Company during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the Transactions.\n\n**Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.**\n\nOn June 21, 2024, the Company issued an aggregate of 4,353,749 Class A ordinary shares to the Sponsor upon the conversion of an equal number of Class B ordinary shares and an aggregate of 390,000 Class A ordinary shares to Norman Pearlstine, Joel Motley, Matt Goldberg, Priscilla Han, Apollo Credit Strategies Master Fund Ltd. and other holders of the Company’s Class B ordinary shares upon the conversion of an equal number of Class B ordinary shares. The Class A ordinary shares issued in connection with the Conversion are subject to the same restrictions applicable to the Class B ordinary shares prior to the Conversion, including, among other things, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of an initial business combination.

DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS**\n\nBlue Ocean Acquisition Corp (the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on March 26, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”). The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.\n\nOn June 6, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Original Merger Agreement”) with TNL Mediagene (formerly, “The News Lens Co., Ltd.”), a Cayman Islands exempted company and TNLMG (formerly “TNL Mediagene”), a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly owned subsidiary of TNL Mediagene (“Merger Sub”), as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 29, 2024 (the “First Amendment”) and Amendment No. 2 to Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 23, 2024 (the “Second Amendment” and, together with the First Amendment, the “Amendments” and, collectively with the Original Merger Agreement, the “Merger Agreement”). On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the parties thereto will enter into a business combination transaction (the “Business Combination” and together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Transactions”) pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of TNL Mediagene (the “Merger”).\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had not yet commenced any operations. All activity through September 30, 2024, relates to the Company’s formation and the initial public offering (the “Public Offering”) which is described below, and subsequent to the Public Offering, identifying a target for a Business Combination, including the negotiation of the Merger Agreement. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end.\n\nThe registration statement for the Company’s Public Offering was declared effective on December 6, 2021 (the “Effective Date”). On December 7, 2021, the Company consummated the Public Offering of 16,500,000 units (the “Units” and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units offered, the “Public Shares”), generating gross proceeds of $165,000,000 which is described in Note 3. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company and one-half of one redeemable warrant (the “Public Warrants”). On December 9, 2021, the underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option and purchased 2,475,000 units (the “Over-Allotment Option Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Over-Allotment Option Unit, generating gross proceeds of $24,750,000.\n\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 8,235,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant that closed in a private placement to Blue Ocean Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”) and Apollo SPAC Fund I, L.P. (“Apollo” or “Anchor Investor”) simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering (see Note 4). On December 9, 2021, the Company consummated the sale of additional 990,000 Private Placement Warrants (the “Additional Private Placement Warrants”) with the Sponsor at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of $990,000.\n\nTransaction costs amounted to $12,517,335, consisting of $3,795,000 in cash underwriting fees, $6,641,250 of deferred underwriting fees, $1,248,100 of offering costs related to the fair value of the Founder Shares sold to Anchor Investor, and $832,985 of other offering costs.\n\nFollowing the closing of the Public Offering, the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, the sale of the Over-Allotment Option Units and the sale of the Additional Private Placement Shares, an amount of $193,545,000 ($10.20 per Public Unit) was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”), located in the United States and will be invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds held in the Trust Account, as described below.\n\n5\n\nExtraordinary General Meeting and Redemption of Class A Shares \n\nOn August 29, 2023, shareholders of the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the “Extraordinary General Meeting”) in lieu of the 2023 annual general meeting of the shareholders of the Company. At the Extraordinary General Meeting, the Company’s shareholders approved the proposal to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to give the Company the right to extend the date by which it has to consummate a business combination from September 7, 2023 to June 7, 2024, by depositing into the Trust Account $60,000 for each of the nine subsequent one-month extensions. In connection therewith the shareholders of record were provided the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights (the “Extension Amendment”). Holders of 12,817,785 Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redemption at a per share redemption price of approximately $10.67. On September 5, 2023, a total of $136,786,445 in redemption payments were made in connection with this redemption. Following the redemption, the Company had a total of 6,157,215 Class A ordinary shares outstanding.\n\nOn May 29, 2024, shareholders of the Company held an Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders in lieu of the 2024 annual general meeting of the shareholders of the company (the “Second Extension Meeting”). At the Second Extension Meeting, the Company’s shareholders approved the proposal to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to give the Company the right to further extend the date by which it has to consummate a business combination from June 7, 2024 to December 7, 2024, by depositing into the Trust Account $30,000 for each of the six subsequent one-month extensions. In connection therewith the shareholders of record were provided the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights (the “Second Extension Amendment”). Holders of 4,315,265 Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redemption at a per share redemption price of approximately $11.20. On June 3, 2024, a total of $48,321,747 in redemption payments were made in connection with this redemption. Following the redemption, the Company had a total of 1,841,950 Class A ordinary shares outstanding.\n\nOn January 24, 2024, the SEC issued final rules (the “SPAC Rules”) relating to, among other things, disclosures in business combination transactions between special purpose acquisition companies (“SPACs”) such as us and private operating companies; the condensed financial statement requirements applicable to transactions involving shell companies; and the use of projections by SPACs in SEC filings in connection with proposed business combination transactions. In connection with the issuance of the SPAC Rules, the SEC also issued guidance (the “SPAC Guidance”) regarding the potential liability of certain participants in proposed business combination transactions and the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“Investment Company Act”) based on certain facts and circumstances such as duration, asset composition, sources of income, business purpose and activities of the SPAC and its management team in furtherance of such goals.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of us being deemed to be an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act) and thus subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, in November 2023, the Company instructed Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the trustee with respect to the Trust Account, to liquidate the U.S. government treasury obligations or money market funds held in the Trust Account and thereafter deposited the cash from the liquidation of the trust assets into an interest-bearing demand deposit account until the earlier of the consummation of the initial Business Combination or the Company’s liquidation, with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company continuing to act as trustee. As a result, following such liquidation, we would receive minimal interest, if any, on the funds held in the trust account, which would reduce the dollar amount our public shareholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company.\n\nThe Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. NASDAQ rules provide that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing a definitive agreement to enter a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination.\n\n6\n\nThe Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the “public shareholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. In connection with a proposed Business Combination, the Company may seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against a Business Combination. The Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company voted at a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination are voted in favor of the Business Combination.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that, a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to 15% or more of the Public Shares without the Company’s prior written consent.\n\nThe public shareholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially $10.20 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The per-share amount to be distributed to shareholders who redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriter (as discussed in Note 6). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company’s warrants. These Class A ordinary shares are recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity” (“ASC 480”).\n\nIf a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Memorandum and Articles of Association, offer such redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination.\n\nThe Company’s Sponsor and Apollo have agreed (a) to vote their Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination, (b) not to propose an amendment to the Company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association with respect to the Company’s pre-Business Combination activities prior to the consummation of a Business Combination unless the Company provides dissenting Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment; (c) not to redeem any shares (including the Founder Shares) into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a Business Combination (or to sell any shares in a tender offer in connection with a Business Combination if the Company does not seek shareholder approval in connection therewith) or a vote to amend the provisions of the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association relating to shareholders’ rights of pre-Business Combination activity and (d) that the Founder Shares shall not participate in any liquidating distributions upon winding up if a Business Combination is not consummated. However, the Sponsor and Apollo will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares purchased during or after the Public Offering if the Company fails to complete its Business Combination.\n\nIf the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Company’s board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company, subject in each case to its obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law.\n\n7\n\nThe underwriter has agreed to waive its rights to the deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).\n\nThe Sponsor and Apollo have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to the Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants it will receive if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor, Apollo or any of their respective affiliates acquire Public Shares, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.\n\nIn order to protect the amounts held in the trust, the Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.20 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the day of liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.20 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriter of Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and believe that the Sponsor’s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot assure its shareholders that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of the Company’s officers or directors will indemnify the Company for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.\n\n**Business Combination**\n\nOn June 6, 2023, the Company entered into the Original Merger Agreement, as subsequently amended by the Amendments. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the parties thereto will enter into Transactions, including the Merger.\n\nAt the closing of the Transactions (the “Closing”), by virtue of the Merger, the outstanding shares and warrants of the Company will be canceled and converted into the right to receive equivalent shares and warrants of TNL Mediagene, and TNL Mediagene is expected to be the publicly traded company with its ordinary shares and warrants listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”).\n\nOn May 29, 2024, the Company, TNL Mediagene and Merger Sub executed the First Amendment for purposes of extending the date to complete the Merger from June 7, 2024 to December 7, 2024. On October 23, 2024, the Company, TNL Mediagene and Merger Sub executed the Second Amendment for purposes of removing the conditions to Closing that (i) TNL Mediagene have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately after the effective time of the Merger and (ii) Minimum Balance Sheet Cash (as defined in the Merger Agreement) be no less than $20,000,000 immediately prior to or upon Closing.\n\n8\n\n**Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $47,683 and $61,977 in its operating bank account, respectively, and had a working capital deficiency of $8,229,168 and $4,204,802, respectively.\n\nThe Company’s liquidity needs to date have been satisfied through a payment of $25,000 from the Sponsor to purchase the Founder Shares, an initial loan of $165,340 from the Sponsor, and the proceeds from the consummation of the Private Placement not held in the Trust Account of $2.2 million. The Company repaid the initial loan from the Sponsor in full on December 6, 2021. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company Working Capital Loans (as defined in Note 5). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 there were no amounts outstanding under any Working Capital Loans.\n\nOn June 20, 2023, the Company entered into a Promissory Note (as defined in Note 5) with the Sponsor pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company up to an aggregate principal amount of up to $1,500,000. The Promissory Note is payable on the earlier of the date on which the Company consummates a Business Combination or June 7, 2024. On May 30, 2024, the Promissory Note was amended to extend the maturity date to December 7, 2024. Upon the consummation of the Business Combination, the Sponsor will have the option, but not the obligation, to convert the entire principal balance of the Promissory Note, in whole or in part, into private placement warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The terms of such private placement warrants (if issued) will be identical to the terms of the private placement warrants issued by the Company in connection with the IPO. The Promissory Note is subject to customary events of default, the occurrence of any of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal and interest balance of the Promissory Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Sponsor Note becoming immediately due and payable. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal and interest under the Promissory Note was $1,411,884, and $66,491, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal and interest under the Promissory Note was $1,080,000, and $15,833, respectively.\n\nOn August 3, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to TNL Mediagene with a principal amount available of up to $400,000, which was later amended and restated on July 15, 2024 to increase the aggregate principal amount available for drawdowns up to $650,000 (as amended and restated, the “TNL Working Capital Note”). Borrowings under the TNL Working Capital Note are available on a monthly basis in increments of at least $25,000 and no more than $32,000 for any individual month and for any earlier individual months in which no borrowings were requested during the term of the TNL Working Capital Note. For the avoidance of doubt, requests by the Company to TNL Mediagene for borrowings under the TNL Mediagene Working Capital Note corresponding to months in which the Company did not previously request any borrowings are permitted to exceed $32,000 in aggregate. The monthly borrowings will be available until the earlier of (i) December 7, 2024, (ii) the date of consummation of the Merger, (iii) termination of the Merger Agreement and (iv) termination of the note by TNL Mediagene upon thirty days written notice by the Company. The TNL Working Capital Note is a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note that will not be repaid in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to consummation of the Business Combination. The TNL Working Capital Note will be paid on the date on which the Company consummates the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The TNL Working Capital Note is subject to events of default, the occurrence of any of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal and interest balance of the Promissory Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Sponsor Note becoming immediately due and payable. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal balance under the TNL Working Capital Note amounted to an aggregate of $454,888 and $149,946, respectively. \n\nOn April 5, 2024, the Company entered into a promissory note with the Sponsor pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company a principal amount of up to $750,000 (the “Sponsor Promissory Note”). The Sponsor Promissory Note is a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note which may be drawn down by the Company from time to time to be used for costs and expenses related to the Company’s initial merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company and one or more businesses or entities. Pursuant to the terms of the Sponsor Promissory Note, if the Business Combination is not consummated, the Sponsor Promissory Note will be repaid solely to the extent that the Company has funds available to it outside of its Trust Account, and that all other amounts will be contributed to capital, forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. The Sponsor Promissory Note is subject to events of default, the occurrence of any of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal of the Sponsor Promissory Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Sponsor Note becoming immediately due and payable. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance under the Sponsor Promissory Note amounted to an aggregate of $704,225.\n\n9\n\nIn accordance with the Extension Amendment, on January 2, 2024, February 2, 2024, March 1, 2024, April 1, 2024 and May 1, 2024, the Company deposited $60,000 into the Trust Account in order to effect additional one month extensions, which extended the deadline to June 7, 2024 to consummate the Business Combination. In accordance with the Second Extension Amendment, on June 3, 2024, July 24, 2024, August 1, 2024 and September 3, 2024, the Company deposited $30,000 into the Trust account, which extended the deadline to October 7, 2024. Through September 30, 2024, an aggregate of $420,000 was deposited into the Trust account in connection with these monthly extension payments. In accordance with the Second Extension Amendment, on October 1, 2024, and November 1, 2024, the Company deposited $30,000 into the Trust account, which extended the deadline to December 7, 2024.\n\nBased on the foregoing, management believes that the Company will have sufficient borrowing capacity from TNL Mediagene, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company’s officers and directors to meet its needs through the consummation of the Merger on or before December 7, 2024.\n\nThe provisions of FASB ASC Topic 205-40, _Presentation of Financial Statements_ – Going Concern, requires management to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. The Company has until December 7, 2024, to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by the specified period. If a Business Combination is not consummated by December 7, 2024, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution.\n\nThe Company’s evaluation of its liquidity condition and the date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern through December 7, 2024. These condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\n\n**Risks and Uncertainties**\n\nManagement is currently evaluating the impact of rising interest rates, inflation, the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in Israel and Palestine on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that any of these could have a negative effect on the Company’s financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these unaudited condensed financial statements. The unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\n**Inflation Reduction Act of 2022**\n\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IR Act”) was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. Because we may acquire a domestic corporation or engage in a transaction in which a domestic corporation becomes our parent or our affiliate and our securities trade on US stock exchange, we may become a “covered corporation” within the meaning of the IR Act. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax.\n\n10\n\n**NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\n**Basis of Presentation**\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the SEC. Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of a normal recurring nature, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, operating results and cash flows for the periods presented.\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Current Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024. The interim results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024 or for any future interim periods.\n\n**Emerging Growth Company**\n\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\n\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company, which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\n\n**Use of Estimates**\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\n\n**Concentration of Credit Risk**\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Coverage of $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on this account and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account.\n\n11\n\n**Cash Held in Trust Account**\n\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all of the assets held in the Trust Account were held in a demand deposit account. Prior to November 2023, the Trust Account was invested in marketable securities and money market funds.\n\n**Cash and Cash Equivalents**\n\nThe Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company had $47,683 and $61,977 in cash held in its operating account as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.\n\n**Income Taxes**\n\nThe Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\n\nASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position.\n\nThere is currently no taxation imposed on income by the Government of the Cayman Islands. In accordance with Cayman income tax regulations, income taxes are not levied on the Company. Consequently, income taxes are not reflected in the Company’s financial statements. The Company’s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.\n\n**Fair Value of Financial Instruments**\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” (“ASC 820”) approximates the carrying amounts represented in the condensed balance sheets, primarily due to their short-term nature.\n\n**Fair Value Measurements**\n\nThe Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and non-financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually.\n\nThe fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities).\n\n12\n\nThe following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities:\n\nLevel 1: | Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.  \n---|---  \nLevel 2: | Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.  \n---|---  \nLevel 3: | Unobservable inputs based on our assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  \n---|---  \n  \nIn some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n\n**Derivative Financial Instruments**\n\nThe Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”). For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value on the grant date and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\n\n**Warrant Liabilities**\n\nThe Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815. The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments, meet the definition of a liability, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own ordinary shares, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.\n\nFor issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statement of operations.\n\nThe Company evaluated the Public Warrants (as defined in Note 7) and the Private Placement Warrants (collectively, the “Warrants”) in accordance with ASC 815, and concluded that a provision in the warrant agreement, dated December 2, 2021 (the “Warrant Agreement”) related to certain tender or exchange offers precludes the Warrants from being accounted for as components of equity. As the Warrants meet the definition of a derivative as contemplated in ASC 815, the Warrants are recorded as derivative liabilities on the condensed balance sheets and measured at fair value at inception (on the date of the IPO) and at each reporting date in accordance with ASC 820 with changes in fair value recognized in the condensed statement of operations in the period of change.\n\n13\n\n**Offering Costs Associated with the Public Offering**\n\nThe Company complies with the requirements of ASC 340-10-S99-1, SEC Staff Accounting bulletin Topic 5A – “Expenses of Offering”, and SEC Staff Accounting bulletin Topic 5T – “Accounting for Expenses or Liabilities Paid by Principal Stockholder(s)”. Offering costs consist principally of professional and registration fees incurred through the balance sheet date that are related to the IPO. Offering costs directly attributable to the issuance of an equity contract to be classified in equity are recorded as a reduction of equity. Offering costs for equity contracts that are classified as assets and liabilities are expensed immediately. The Company incurred offering costs amounting to $12,517,335 as a result of the Public Offering (consisting of $3,795,000 of underwriting fees, $6,641,250 of deferred underwriting fees, $1,248,100 for the excess fair value of Founder Shares attributable to the Anchor Investor, and $832,985 of other offering costs). The Company recorded $10,788,729 of offering costs as a reduction of equity in connection with the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units. The Company immediately expensed $480,506 of offering costs in connection with the Warrants that were classified as liabilities.\n\n**Class A Shares Subject to Possible Redemption**\n\nThe Company accounts for its Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC 480. Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption are classified as a liability instrument and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders’ equity. The Company’s Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company’s control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption is presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders’ deficit section of the Company’s condensed balance sheets.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount of Class A ordinary shares reflected on the balance sheet are reconciled in the following table:\n\nClass A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption as of December 31, 2022 | $| 196,226,283  \n---|---|---  \nPlus  \nAdjust carrying value to initial redemption value | 7,774,907  \nLess  \nShares redeemed in September 2023 | (136,786,445| )  \nClass A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption as of December 31, 2023 | $| 67,214,745  \nPlus  \nAdjust carrying value to initial redemption value | 1,056,674  \nLess  \nClass A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption as of March 31, 2024 | 68,271,419  \nPlus  \nAdjust carrying value to initial redemption value | 861,333  \nLess  \nShares redeemed in June 2024 | (48,321,747| )  \nClass A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption as of June 30, 2024 | $| 20,811,005  \nPlus  \nAdjust carrying value to initial redemption value | 361,258  \nClass A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption as of September 30, 2024 | $| 21,172,263  \n  \n**Net Income (Loss) Per Ordinary Share**\n\nBasic income (loss) per ordinary share is computed by dividing net income applicable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Consistent with ASC 480, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption, as well as their pro rata share of undistributed trust earnings consistent with the two-class method, have been excluded from the calculation of income per ordinary share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of trust earnings. Diluted income per share includes the incremental number of ordinary shares to be issued to settle warrants, as calculated for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company did not have any dilutive warrants, securities or other contracts that could potentially be exercised or converted into ordinary shares. As a result, diluted income per ordinary share is the same as basic income (loss) per ordinary share for all periods presented.\n\n14\n\nA reconciliation of net income (loss) per ordinary share is as follows:\n\nFor the Three Months ended September, 2024 | For the Three Months ended September 30, 2023  \n---|---  \nClass A – Subject to Redemption | Class A and Class B – non-Redeemable | Class A – Subject to Redemption | Class B  \nEPS  \nNumerator: Net Income (Loss)  \nAllocation of net income (loss) | $| (171,330| ) | $| (441,242| ) | $| 713,227 | $| 213,042  \nDenominator: Weighted Average share  \nBasic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding | 1,841,950 | 4,743,750 | 15,491,906 | 4,718,750  \nBasic and diluted net income (loss) per ordinary share | $| (0.09| ) | $| (0.09| ) | $| 0.05 | $| 0.05  \nFor the Nine Months ended September 30, 2024 | For the Nine Months ended September 30, 2023  \n---|---  \nClass A – Subject to Redemption | Class A and Class B – Non-redeemable | Class A – Subject to Redemption | Class B  \nEPS  \nNumerator: Net Income (Loss)  \nAllocation of net income (loss) | $| (797,323| ) | $| (874,800| ) | $| 2,737,634 | $| 727,726  \nDenominator: Weighted Average share  \nBasic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding | 4,323,623 | 4,743,750 | 17,796,895 | 4,732,721  \nBasic and diluted net income (loss) per ordinary share | $| (0.18| ) | $| (0.18| ) | $| 0.15 | $| 0.15  \n  \nThe Class A ordinary shares issued upon conversion of the founder Class B ordinary shares are non-redeemable (see Note 8).\n\n**Stock Compensation Expense**\n\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”). Under ASC 718, stock-based compensation associated with equity-classified awards is measured at fair value upon the grant date and recognized over the requisite service period. To the extent a stock-based award is subject to a performance condition, the amount of expense recorded in a given period, if any, reflects an assessment of the probability of achieving such performance condition, with compensation recognized once the event is deemed probable to occur. Forfeitures are recognized as incurred. The Company has not recognized any stock-based compensation expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\n**Accounting Standards Recently Implemented**\n\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06 Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815–40) (“ASU 2020-06”). ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity’s own equity. The ASU is part of the FASB’s simplification initiative, which aims to reduce unnecessary complexity in GAAP. The ASU’s amendments are effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2024. The Company’s management does not believe that the adoption of ASU 2020-06 had a material impact on the Company’s unaudited condensed financial statements and disclosures.\n\n**Recently Issued Accounting Standards**\n\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.\n\n15\n\n**NOTE 3. PUBLIC OFFERING**\n\nPursuant to the Public Offering, the Company sold 16,500,000 Units at $10.00 per Unit. On December 9, 2021, the underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option and purchased 2,475,000 Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $24,750,000. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, $0.0001 par value, and one-half of one redeemable warrant. Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share (see Note 7).\n\nAn Anchor Investor unaffiliated with any member of our management team purchased an aggregate of 1,895,602 of the Units sold in the Public Offering. These Units purchased by Apollo in this offering are not subject to any agreements restricting their transfer. Further, Apollo purchased 175,000 founder shares at $0.0058 per share.\n\nThe Company considers the excess fair value of the Founder Shares issued to the Anchor Investor above the purchase price as offering costs and will reduce the gross proceeds by this amount. The Company has valued the excess fair value over consideration of the founder shares offered to the Anchor Investor at $1,248,100. The excess of the fair value over consideration of the Founder Shares was determined to be an offering cost in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A and 5T and were allocated to shareholders’ equity and expenses upon the completion of the Public Offering.\n\n**NOTE 4. PRIVATE PLACEMENT**\n\nSimultaneously with the closing of Public Offering, the Sponsor and Anchor Investor purchased an aggregate of 8,235,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. On December 9, 2021, the Company consummated the sale of additional 990,000 Private Placement Warrants with the Sponsor at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of $990,000.\n\nEach Private Placement Warrant is identical to the warrants offered in the Public Offering, except there is no redemption rights or liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to Private Placement Warrants, which will expire worthless if we do not consummate a Business Combination within the Combination Period. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants were added to the net proceeds from the Public Offering held in the Trust Account.\n\n**NOTE 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**\n\n**Founder Shares**\n\nOn March 26, 2021, the Company issued an aggregate of 4,312,500 Class B ordinary shares (the “Founder Shares”) to the Sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. On December 2, 2021, the Company effected a share capitalization of an additional 431,250 Class B ordinary shares, resulting in an aggregate of 4,743,750 Class B ordinary shares outstanding. All share and per-share amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect the share capitalization. \n\nOn June 21, 2024, the Company issued an aggregate of 4,353,749 Class A ordinary shares to the Sponsor upon the conversion of an equal number of Class B ordinary shares and an aggregate of 390,000 Class A ordinary shares to Norman Pearlstine, Joel Motley, Matt Goldberg, Priscilla Han, Apollo Credit Strategies Master Fund Ltd. and other holders of the Company’s Class B ordinary shares upon the conversion of an equal number of Class B ordinary shares. The Class A ordinary shares issued in connection with the Conversion are subject to the same restrictions applicable to the Class B ordinary shares prior to the Conversion, including, among other things, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of an initial business combination. Following the Conversion, the Company had a total of 6,585,699 Class A ordinary shares outstanding, of which 1,841,950 were redeemable Class A ordinary shares, and one Class B ordinary share outstanding.\n\n16\n\nThe Sponsor and Anchor Investor have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of its Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) one year after the completion of a Business Combination or (B) subsequent to our initial Business Combination (x) if the last reported sale price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share sub-divisions, share dividends, rights issuances, consolidations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and other similar transactions) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial Business Combination or (y) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of our Public Shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property.\n\nThe Anchor Investor has not been granted any shareholder or other rights in addition to those afforded to the Company’s other public shareholders. Further, the Anchor Investor is not required to (i) hold any Units, Class A ordinary shares or warrants purchased in the Public Offering or thereafter for any amount of time, (ii) vote any Class A ordinary shares they may own at the applicable time in favor of the Business Combination or (iii) refrain from exercising their right to redeem their public shares at the time of the Business Combination. The Anchor Investor has the same rights to the funds held in the Trust Account with respect to the Class A ordinary shares underlying the Units they purchased in the Public Offering as the rights afforded to the Company’s other public shareholders.\n\n**Related Party Loans**\n\nIn order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Company’s Sponsor, an affiliate of the Sponsor, or the Company’s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (the “Working Capital Loans”). Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of notes may be converted upon consummation of a Business Combination into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. There are no Working Capital Loans outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\n**Convertible Promissory Note**\n\nOn June 20, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured convertible promissory note (the ” Promissory Note”) to the Sponsor for borrowings from time to time of up to an aggregate of $1,500,000 which may be drawn by the Company to finance costs incurred in connection with a potential initial business combination and for working capital purposes and/or to finance monthly deposits into the Trust Account for each public share that is not redeemed in connection with the extension of the Company’s termination date from September 7, 2023 to June 7, 2024. On May 30, 2024, in connection with the extension of the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination from July 7, 2024, to December 7, 2024, the Promissory Note was amended to provide for payment on the earlier of the date on which the Company consummates a Business Combination or December 7, 2024. The Promissory Note is interest bearing, at the applicable federal interest rate, compounded per annum, and is payable on the earlier of (i) December 7, 2024; (ii) the date on which the Company consummates a Business Combination or (iii) the Company liquidates the Trust Account upon the failure to consummate an initial business combination within the requisite time period. Upon consummation of the Company’s initial business combination, the Promissory Note may be converted, at the Sponsor’s discretion, into private placement warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal balance including interest under the Promissory Note amounted to an aggregate of $1,478,375 and $1,095,833, respectively. Interest expense amounted to $16,700 and $50,658 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Interest expense amounted to $5,368 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n17\n\n**Sponsor Promissory Note**\n\nOn April 5, 2024, the Company entered into a promissory note with the Sponsor pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company a principal amount equal to $750,000 (the “Sponsor Promissory Note”). The Sponsor Promissory Note is a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note which may be drawn down by the Company from time to time to be used for costs and expenses related to the Company’s initial merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company and one or more businesses or entities. Pursuant to the terms of the Sponsor Promissory Note, if the Business Combination is not consummated, the Sponsor Promissory Note will be repaid solely to the extent that the Company has funds available to it outside of its Trust Account, and that all other amounts will be contributed to capital, forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven or eliminated. The Sponsor Promissory Note is subject to events of default, the occurrence of any of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal of the Sponsor Promissory Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Sponsor Note becoming immediately due and payable. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance under the Sponsor Promissory Note amounted to $704,225.\n\n**Administrative Support Agreement**\n\nOn December 2, 2021, the Company entered into an administrative support agreement with the Sponsor pursuant to which, until the Company’s initial business combination or liquidation, the Company may reimburse an affiliate of the Sponsor up to an amount of $10,000 per month for office space and secretarial and administrative support (the “Administrative Support Agreement”). The Company recognized $30,000 and $90,000 of expense, for each of the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which are included in “General and administrative expenses” in the accompanying condensed statements of operations. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the outstanding balance under the Administrative Support Agreement was $320,000 and $230,000, respectively.\n\n**Consulting Agreements**\n\nThe Company and Mr. Leggett entered into a consulting agreement on October 11, 2022, as amended July 31, 2023 (the “Leggett Consulting Agreement”). Under the Leggett Consulting Agreement, Mr. Leggett is entitled to $20,000 per month for certain services Mr. Leggett provides to the Company and its affiliates. Mr. Leggett is separately entitled under the Leggett Consulting Agreement to a success bonus of $250,000 to be paid within 10 business days of the close of the business combination, subject to a reduction by $17,500 for each month in which the Company pays Mr. Leggett a consulting service fee under the Leggett Consulting Agreement. The Company and Mr. Lasov entered into a consulting agreement on November 22, 2022, as amended July 31, 2023 (the “Lasov Consulting Agreement”). Under the Lasov Consulting Agreement, Mr. Lasov is entitled to $32,500 per month for certain services Mr. Lasov provides to the Company and its affiliates. Mr. Lasov is separately entitled under the Lasov Consulting Agreement to a success bonus of $150,000 to be paid within 10 business days of the close of the business combination, subject to a reduction by the amount of each consulting service fee paid to Mr. Lasov by the Company under the Lasov Consulting Agreement. Mr. Leggett agreed that as of April 1, 2024, to reduce his monthly service fee under the Leggett Consulting Agreement to $5,000 per month, of which $2,500 will be deducted from his success bonus. The Company recognized an aggregate expense of $112,500 and $382,500, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which are included in “General and administrative” expenses in the accompanying condensed statements of operations. The Company recognized $157,500, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, which are included in “General and administrative” expenses in the accompanying condensed statements of operations. The aggregate amount due of $115,000 and $52,500 are included in “Accounts payable and accrued expenses” on the accompanying condensed balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company is obligated to pay a success bonus of $77,500 to Mr. Leggett upon the consummation of a business combination. The Company is no longer obligated to pay a success bonus to Mr. Lasov, as the amounts previously expensed under his agreement has exceeded the bonus amount.\n\n18\n\n**NOTE 6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**\n\n**Registration Rights**\n\nThe holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and any warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans (and in each case holders of their component securities, as applicable) are entitled to registration rights pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, effective December 2, 2021, which requires the Company to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to our Class A ordinary shares). The holders of the majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the consummation of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\n\n**Underwriter’s Agreement**\n\nThe Company paid a cash underwriting discount of 2.00% of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering, or $3,795,000 due to the exercise of the over-allotment option in full. In addition, the underwriter is entitled to a deferred fee of three and a half percent (3.50%) of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering, or $6,641,250. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. The underwriter has reimbursed the Company for $550,000 for offering expenses. The reimbursement of these costs has been accounted for as a reduction to offering costs of the Public Offering.\n\n**NOTE 7. WARRANTS**\n\nThe Company accounted for the 18,712,500 warrants issued in connection with the Public Offering (the 9,487,500 Public Warrants and the 9,225,000 Private Placement Warrants) in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815. Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each warrant much be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, the Company has classified each warrant as a liability at its fair value. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the Company’s statement of operations.\n\n**_Warrants-_** Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants will become exercisable 30 days after the consummation of a Business Combination. The Public Warrants will expire five years from the consummation of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.\n\nThe Company will not be obligated to deliver any Class A ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a Public Warrant and will have no obligation to settle such Public Warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration. No Public Warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their Public Warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available.\n\nThe Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days, after the closing of a Business Combination, it will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement registering the issuance, under the Securities Act, of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants, to cause such registration statement to become effective and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the Warrant Agreement. If a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th business day after the closing of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption.\n\n19\n\n** _Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $ 18.00. _**\n\nOnce the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the Warrants for redemption:\n\n●| in whole and not in part;  \n---|---  \n●| at a price of $0.01 per Public Warrant;  \n---|---  \n●| upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder and  \n---|---  \n●| if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant as described) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company will not redeem the warrants as described above unless an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares is available throughout the 30-day redemption period. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, the Company may exercise its redemption right even if the Company is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.\n\n**_Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $ 10.00._**\n\nOnce the Warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the Warrants for redemption:\n\n●| in whole and not in part;  \n---|---  \n●| at $0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption provided that holders will be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis prior to redemption and receive that number of shares determined by reference to the table based on the redemption date and the “fair market value” of our Class A ordinary shares;  \n---|---  \n●| if, and only if, the Reference Value (as defined above under “Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds $18.00”) equals or exceeds $10.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant); and  \n---|---  \n●| if the Reference Value is less than $18.00 per share (as adjusted for adjustments to the number of shares issuable upon exercise or the exercise price of a warrant), the Private Placement Warrants must also concurrently be called for redemption on the same terms as the outstanding Public Warrants, as described above.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf and when the Public Warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may not exercise its redemption right if the issuance of shares of ordinary shares upon exercise of the warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws or the Company is unable to effect such registration or qualification. \n\nThe exercise price and number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Public Warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless. If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the Warrant Agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless.\n\n20\n\nIn addition, if (x) the Company issues additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of its initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of Class A ordinary shares (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company’s board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the Sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the “Newly Issued Price”), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the Company’s initial Business Combination on the date of the consummation of such initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price and the $18.00 per share redemption trigger price described above will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the greater of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.\n\nThe Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants included in the Units sold in the Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants and the shares of ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants are not transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis and are non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.\n\n**NOTE 8. SHAREHOLDERS’ DEFICIT**\n\n**_Preferred Shares_** -The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value preferred shares. On September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no preferred shares issued or outstanding.\n\n**_Class A Ordinary shares_** -The Company is authorized to issue up to 200,000,000 Class A, $0.0001 par value ordinary shares. Holders of the Company’s ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share.\n\n**_Class B Ordinary shares_** -The Company is authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 Class B, $0.0001 par value ordinary shares. Holders of the Company’s ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share. On December 2, 2021, the Company effected a share capitalization of an additional 431,250 Class B ordinary shares, resulting in an aggregate of 4,743,750 Class B ordinary shares outstanding.\n\nHolders of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all other matters submitted to a vote of shareholders, except as required by law; provided that only holders of Class B ordinary shares have the right to vote for the election of directors prior to the Company’s initial Business Combination.\n\nThe Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares at the time of the initial Business Combination, or earlier at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for share sub-divisions, share dividends, rights issuances, consolidations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like, and subject to further adjustment as provided herein. In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts issued and related to the closing of the initial Business Combination, the ratio at which the Class B ordinary shares will convert into Class A ordinary shares will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding Class B ordinary shares agree to waive such anti-dilution adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Class B ordinary shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of all shares issued and outstanding plus all Class A ordinary shares and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the initial Business Combination, excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial Business Combination. The term “equity-linked securities” refers to any debt or equity securities that are convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for the Company’s Class A ordinary shares issued in a financing transaction in connection with the initial business combination, including but not limited to a private placement of equity or debt.\n\n21\n\nOn June 21, 2024, pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company, the Sponsor and certain directors, of the Company elected to convert an aggregate of 4,353,749 and 390,000, respectively, of outstanding Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share on a one-for-one basis into non-redeemable Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share of the Company, with immediate effect. The non-redeemable Class A Ordinary Shares issued in connection with the conversion are subject to the same restrictions as applied to the Class B ordinary shares before the conversion, including, and among other things, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of a Business Combination as described in the prospectus for the Company’s IPO. The Company modified its balance sheet and statements of shareholders’ equity to reflect the impact of these conversions. Following such conversion, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had an aggregate of 4,743,749 non-redeemable Class A ordinary shares and one Class B ordinary share issued and outstanding.\n\nPursuant to and concurrently with the Public Offering, the Company sold 18,975,000 Units. In connection with the Extraordinary General Meeting and Second Extension Meeting, the shareholders of record were provided the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights. On June 3, 2024 and September 5, 2023, holders of 4,315,265 and 12,817,785 Class A ordinary shares, respectively, exercised their right to redemption. Following the redemptions, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had a total of 1,841,950 Class A ordinary shares outstanding subject to possible redemption (see Note 2).\n\nOn August 21, 2024, the Company received a deficiency letter from NASDAQ relating to non-compliance with NASDAQ’s listing requirement which requires the Company to have at least 400 total holders for the continued listing on the NASDAQ. The Company had until October 7, 2024 to submit a plan to regain compliance with the minimum public holders rule. On October 4, 2024, the Company submitted to NASDAQ a plan to regain compliance with the minimum public holders rule.\n\n**NOTE 9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS**\n\nThe following table presents information about the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value:\n\n**September 30,** **2024** | **Quoted Prices in** **Active** **Markets** **(Level 1)** | **Significant Other** **Observable** **Inputs (Level 2)** | **Significant Other** **Unobservable** **Inputs (Level 3)**  \n---|---|---|---  \nAssets:  \nCash held in Trust Account | $| 21,172,263 | $| 21,172,263 | $| — | $| —  \nLiabilities:  \nWarrant liabilities – Public Warrants | $| 152,749 | $| — | $| 152,749 | $| —  \nWarrant liabilities – Private Placement Warrants | $| 148,523 | $| — | $| — | $| 148,523  \nDecember 31, 2023 | **Quoted Prices in** **Active** **Markets** **(Level 1)** | **Significant Other** **Observable** **Inputs** **(Level 2)** | **Significant Other** **Unobservable** **Inputs** **(Level 3)**  \n---|---|---|---  \nAssets:  \nCash held in Trust Account | $| 67,214,745 | $| 67,214,745 | $| — | $| —  \nLiabilities:  \nWarrant liabilities – Public Warrants | $| 189,750 | $| — | $| 189,750 | $| —  \nWarrant liabilities – Private Placement Warrants | $| 184,500 | $| — | $| — | $| 184,500  \n  \nThe Warrants are accounted for as liabilities in accordance with ASC 815 and are presented within warrant liabilities on the condensed balance sheets. The warrant liabilities are measured at fair value at inception and on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented within change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the condensed statements of operations. Transfers to/from Levels 1, 2 and 3 are recognized at the beginning of the reporting period in which a change in valuation technique or methodology occurs.\n\n22\n\nThe Private Placement Warrants were valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is considered to be a Level 3 fair value measurement. The key inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the Private Placement Warrants were as follows as of September 30, 2024:\n\nInput | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---|---  \nRisk-free interest rate | 3.81| % | 3.88| %  \nExpected term (years) | 4.25 | 4.78  \nExpected volatility | 0| % | 0| %  \nExercise price | $| 11.50 | $| 11.50  \nFair value of Class A ordinary shares | $| 11.43 | $| 10.78  \n  \nThe Company’s use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model required the use of subjective assumptions:\n\n●| The risk-free interest rate assumption was based on the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rate for the expected term of the warrants.  \n---|---  \n●| The expected term was determined utilizing a probability weighted term input to be consistent with the stock price and volatility inputs which are reflective of the probability of successful merger.  \n---|---  \n●| The expected volatility assumption was based on the implied volatility solved by calibrating the warrant value output from a Binomial Lattice based model to the publicly observed, traded price on each valuation date. An increase in the expected volatility, in isolation, would result in an increase in the fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities and vice versa.  \n---|---  \n●| The fair value of one Class A ordinary share is the publicly-traded stock price.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe following table presents the changes in the fair value of the Company’s Level 3 financial instruments that are measured at fair value:\n\nFair value as of December 31, 2022 | $| 691,875  \n---|---|---  \nChange in fair value | 139,298  \nFair value as of March 31, 2023 | $| 831,173  \nChange in fair value | (433,575| )  \nFair value as of June 30, 2023 | $| 397,598  \nChange in fair value | 119,925  \nFair value as of September 30, 2023 | $| 517,523  \nChange in fair value | (333,023| )  \nFair value as of December 31, 2023 | $| 184,500  \nChange in fair value | (7,380| )  \nFair value as of March 31, 2024 | $| 177,120  \nChange in fair value | (34,132| )  \nFair value as of June 30, 2024 | $| 142,988  \nChange in fair value | 5,535  \nFair value as of September 30, 2024 | 148,523  \n  \n**NOTE 10. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**\n\nManagement of the Company evaluated events that have occurred after the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were issued. Based upon this review, other than below, management did not identify any recognized or non-recognized subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.\n\nIn accordance with the Second Extension Amendment, on October 1, 2024, and November 1, 2024, the Company deposited $30,000 into the Trust account, which extended the deadline to November 7, 2024 and December 7, 2024, respectively.\n\nThe Company borrowed an additional $170,980 under the TNL Working Capital Note through November 21, 2024.\n\nOn October 23, 2024, contemporaneously with the execution of the amendment to the Merger Agreement (see Note 1), the Company, Sponsor and TNL Mediagene entered into an amendment to the amended and restated letter agreement dated June 6, 2023, to provide that the Sponsor shall forfeit 2,208,859 Founder Shares and 50% of the Private Placement Warrants immediately prior to the close of the Merger, subject in each case, to adjustment based on the amount of minimum balance sheet cash calculated in accordance with the Merger Agreement.\n\n23\n\n**Item 2.

On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the parties thereto will enter into a business combination transaction (the “Business Combination” and together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Transactions”), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into us, with us surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of TNL Mediagene (the “Merger”).\n\nAt the closing of the Transactions (the “Closing”), by virtue of the Merger, our outstanding shares and warrants will be canceled and converted into the right to receive equivalent shares and warrants of TNL Mediagene, and TNL Mediagene is expected to be the publicly traded company with its ordinary shares and warrants listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”).\n\nWe intend to effectuate our initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of the Public Offering, the sale of the Private Placement Warrants and the Additional Private Placement Warrants, our capital shares, debt or a combination of cash, shares and debt. The Company is an “emerging growth company”, and as such, the Company is subject to all risks associated with emerging growth companies.\n\n24\n\nOn August 29, 2023, shareholders of the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the “Extraordinary General Meeting”) in lieu of the 2023 annual general meeting of the shareholders of the Company. At the Extraordinary General Meeting, the Company’s shareholders approved the proposal to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to give the Company the right to extend the date by which it has to consummate a business combination from September 7, 2023 to June 7, 2024, by depositing into the Trust Account $60,000 for each of the nine subsequent one-month extensions. In connection therewith the shareholders of record were provided the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights (the “Extension Amendment”). Holders of 12,817,785 Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redemption at a per share redemption price of approximately $10.67. On September 5, 2023, a total of $136,786,445 in redemption payments were made in connection with this redemption. Following the redemption, the Company had a total of 6,157,215 Class A ordinary shares outstanding\n\nOn May 29, 2024, shareholders of the Company held an Extraordinary General Meeting of shareholders in lieu of the 2024 annual general meeting of the shareholders of the company (the “Second Extension Meeting”). At the Second Extension Meeting, the Company’s shareholders approved the proposal to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to give the Company the right to further extend the date by which it has to consummate a business combination from June 7, 2024, to December 7, 2024, by depositing into the Trust Account the lesser of $30,000 or $0.035 per Public Share for each of the six subsequent one-month extensions. In connection therewith the shareholders of record were provided the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights (the “Second Extension Amendment”). Holders of 4,315,265 Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redemption at a per share redemption price of approximately $11.20. On June 3, 2024, a total of $48,321,747 in redemption payments were made in connection with the Second Extension Amendment. Following the Second Extension Amendment, the Company had a total of 1,841,950 Class A ordinary shares outstanding.\n\nOn June 21, 2024, the Company issued an aggregate of 4,353,749 Class A ordinary shares to the Sponsor upon the conversion of an equal number of Class B ordinary shares and an aggregate of 390,000 Class A ordinary shares to Norman Pearlstine, Joel Motley, Matt Goldberg, Priscilla Han, Apollo Credit Strategies Master Fund Ltd. and other holders of the Company’s Class B ordinary shares upon the conversion of an equal number of Class B ordinary shares (together, the “Conversion”). The Class A ordinary shares issued in connection with the Conversion are subject to the same restrictions applicable to the Class B ordinary shares prior to the Conversion, including, among other things, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of an initial business combination. Following the Conversion, the Company had a total of 6,585,699 Class A ordinary shares outstanding, of which 1,841,950 were redeemable Class A ordinary shares, and one Class B ordinary share outstanding.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash of $47,683 and had a working capital deficit of $8,229,168. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to complete a business combination will be successful.\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\nWe did not commence operations until after the closing of our Public Offering in December 2021, and as of September 30, 2024, we have not engaged in any significant operations nor generated any operating revenues to date. We will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial Business Combination. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents. There has been no significant change in our financial or trading position and no material adverse change has occurred since the date of our audited financial statements. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.\n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net losses of $612,572 and $1,672,123, respectively, which were impacted by the change in fair value of warrant liability of $(11,228) and $72,978, respectively, interest expense of $16,700 and $50,658, respectively, and interest earned on cash held in trust account of $271,259 and $1,859,265, respectively and a loss from operations of $855,903 and $3,553,708, respectively.\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of $926,269 which was impacted by interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $2,107,466, offset by change in fair value of warrant liability of $243,263, interest expense of $5,368 and a loss from operations of $932,566.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of $3,465,360 which was impacted by interest earned on marketable securities held in the trust account of $5,986,162, change in fair value of warrant liability of $353,666, unrealized gain on marketable securities held in the trust account of $670,104, interest expense of $5,368 and a loss from operations of $3,539,204. \n\n25\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nOn December 7, 2021, we consummated our Public Offering of 16,500,000 Units and the Private Placement of an aggregate of 8,235,000 private placement warrants, generating gross proceeds of $173,235,000. On December 9, 2021, the Underwriter exercised in full the option granted to them by the Company to purchase up to 2,475,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, and we issued an additional 990,000 Private Placement Warrants in the Additional Private Placement, generating total gross proceeds of $25,245,000.\n\nFollowing our Public Offering, the exercise of the over-allotment option and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, a total of $193,545,000 was placed in the Trust Account. We incurred $12,517,335 in transaction costs, including $3,795,000 in cash underwriting fees, $6,641,250 of deferred underwriting fees, $1,248,100 of offering costs related to the fair value of the Founder Shares sold to Apollo, and $832,985 of other offering costs.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was $935,345. Net loss of $1,672,123 was impacted by interest earned on cash held the Trust Account of $1,859,265, change in fair value of warrant liability of $72,978, interest expense of $50,658 and changes in operating assets and liabilities, $2,618,363.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had cash of $21,172,263 and $67,214,745 held in the Trust Account, respectively. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account (less taxes paid and deferred underwriting commissions) to complete our initial Business Combination. We may withdraw interest to pay taxes.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash of $47,683 and $61,977 outside of the Trust Account, respectively. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete our initial Business Combination.\n\nIn connection with Extraordinary General Meeting on August 29, 2023, the shareholders of record were provided the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights. Holders of 12,817,785 Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redemption, subsequently a total of $136,786,445 in redemption payments were made in connection with this redemption from the Trust Account. In connection with the Second Extension Meeting on May 29, 2024, the shareholders of record were provided with the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights. Holders of 4,315,265 Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redemption, subsequently a total of $48,321,747 in redemption payments were made in connection with this redemption from the Trust Account. Following these redemptions, the Company had a total of 1,841,950 Class A ordinary shares outstanding. On June 21, 2024, the Company issued an aggregate of 4,353,749 Class A ordinary shares to the Sponsor upon the conversion of an equal number of Class B ordinary shares and an aggregate of 390,000 Class A ordinary shares to Norman Pearlstine, Joel Motley, Matt Goldberg, Priscilla Han, Apollo Credit Strategies Master Fund Ltd. and other holders of the Company’s Class B ordinary shares upon the conversion of an equal number of Class B ordinary shares. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, we did not withdraw any other interest earned on the Trust Account. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.\n\nIn addition, in order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial Business Combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial Business Combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to us. Otherwise, such loans may be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that our initial Business Combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our Trust Account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination company, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender.\n\n26\n\nOn June 20, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured convertible promissory note (the “Promissory Note”) to the Sponsor for borrowings from time to time of up to an aggregate of $1,500,000 which may be drawn by the Company to finance costs incurred in connection with a potential initial business combination and for working capital purposes and/or to finance monthly deposits into the Trust Account for each public share that is not redeemed in connection with the extension of the Company’s termination date from September 7, 2023 to June 7, 2024. On May 30, 2024, in connection with the extension of the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination from July 7, 2024, to December 7, 2024, the Promissory Note was amended to provide for payment on the earlier of the date on which the Company consummates a Business Combination or December 7, 2024. The Promissory Note is interest bearing, at the applicable federal interest rate, compounded, per annum, and is payable on the earlier of (i) December 7, 2024; (ii) the date on which the Company consummates a Business Combination or (iii) the Company liquidates the Trust Account upon the failure to consummate an initial business combination within the requisite time period. Upon consummation of the Company’s initial business combination, the Promissory Note may be converted, at the Sponsor’s discretion, into private placement warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal balance including interest under the Promissory Note amounted to an aggregate of $1,478,375 and 1,095,833, respectively. Interest expense amounted to $16,700 and $50,658 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Interest expense amounted to $5,368 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nOn August 3, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note to TNL Mediagene with a principal amount available of up to $400,000, which was later amended and restated on July 15, 2024 to increase the aggregate principal amount available for drawdowns to up to $650,000 (as amended and restated, the “TNL Working Capital Note”). Borrowings under the TNL Working Capital Note are available on a monthly basis in increments of at least $25,000 and no more than $32,000. The monthly borrowings will be available until the earlier of (i) December 7, 2024, (ii) the date of consummation of the Merger, (iii) termination of the Merger Agreement and (iv) termination of the note by TNL Mediagene upon thirty days written notice by the Company. The TNL Working Capital Note is a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note that will not be repaid in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to consummation of the Business Combination. The TNL Working Capital Note will be paid on the date on which the Company consummates the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The following shall constitute an event of default under the TNL Working Capital Note: (i) a failure to pay the principal within five business days of the maturity date and (ii) the commencement of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy action. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the outstanding principal balance under the TNL Working Capital Note amounted to an aggregate of $454,888 and $149,946, respectively.\n\nOn April 5, 2024, the Company entered into a promissory note with the Sponsor pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company a principal amount equal to $750,000 (the “Sponsor Promissory Note”). The Sponsor Promissory Note is a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note which may be drawn down by the Company from time to time to be used for costs and expenses related to the Company’s initial merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company and one or more businesses or entities. Pursuant to the terms of the Sponsor Promissory Note, if the Business Combination is not consummated, the Sponsor Promissory Note will be repaid solely to the extent that the Company has funds available to it outside of its Trust Account, and that all other amounts will be contributed to capital, forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven or eliminated. The Sponsor Promissory Note is subject to events of default, the occurrence of any of which automatically triggers the unpaid principal of the Sponsor Promissory Note and all other sums payable with regard to the Sponsor Note becoming immediately due and payable. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance under the Sponsor Promissory Note amounted to $704,225.\n\nBased on the foregoing, management believes that the Company will have sufficient borrowing capacity from TNL Mediagene, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company's officers and directors to meet its needs through the consummation of the Merger on or before December 7, 2024.\n\nFASB ASC Topic 205-40, _Presentation of Financial Statements_ – Going Concern requires management to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued. The Company has until December 7, 2024, to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by the specified period. If a Business Combination is not consummated by December 7, 2024, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution.\n\nThe Company’s evaluation of its liquidity condition and the date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern through December 7, 2024. These condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\n\n27\n\n**Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements**\n\nOn September 30, 2024, we did not have any obligations, assets or liabilities that would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations.\n\n**Contractual Obligations**\n\n _Administrative Support Agreement_\n\nOn December 2, 2021, the Company entered into an Administrative Support Agreement pursuant to which the Company may reimburse an affiliate of the Sponsor up to an amount of $10,000 per month for office space and secretarial and administrative support.\n\n_Registration Rights_\n\nThe holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and any warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans (and in each case holders of their component securities, as applicable) are entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement effective December 2, 2021, which requires the Company to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to our Class A ordinary shares). The holders of the majority of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the consummation of a business combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\n\n_Underwriter’s Agreement_\n\nThe Company paid a cash underwriting discount of 2.00% of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering, or $3,795,000 due to the exercise of the over-allotment option in full. In addition, the underwriter will be entitled to a deferred fee of three and a half percent (3.50%) of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering, or $6,641,250. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. The underwriter has reimbursed the Company for $550,000 for offering expenses. The reimbursement of these costs has been accounted for as a reduction to offering costs of the Public Offering.\n\n_Consulting Agreements_\n\nThe Company and Mr. Leggett entered into a consulting agreement on October 11, 2022, as amended July 31, 2023 (the “Leggett Consulting Agreement”). Under the Leggett Consulting Agreement, Mr. Leggett is entitled to $20,000 per month for certain services Mr. Leggett provides to the Company and its affiliates. Mr. Leggett is separately entitled under the Leggett Consulting Agreement to a success bonus of $250,000 to be paid within 10 business days of the close of the business combination, subject to a reduction by $17,500 for each month in which the Company pays Mr. Leggett a consulting service fee under the Leggett Consulting Agreement. The Company and Mr. Lasov entered into a consulting agreement on November 22, 2022, as amended July 31, 2023 (the “Lasov Consulting Agreement”). Under the Lasov Consulting Agreement, Mr. Lasov is entitled to $32,500 per month for certain services Mr. Lasov provides to the Company and its affiliates. Mr. Lasov is separately entitled under the Lasov Consulting Agreement to a success bonus of $150,000 to be paid within 10 business days of the close of the business combination, subject to a reduction by the amount of each consulting service fee paid to Mr. Lasov by the Company under the Lasov Consulting Agreement. Mr. Leggett has agreed that as of April 1, 2024, he will reduce his monthly service fee under the Leggett Consulting Agreement to $5,000. The Company recognized an aggregate expense of $112,500 and $382,500, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which are included in “General and administrative” expenses in the accompanying condensed statements of operations. The Company recognized $157,500 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, which are included in “General and administrative” expenses in the accompanying condensed statements of operations. The aggregate amount due of $115,000 and $52,500 are included in “Accounts payable and accrued expenses” on the accompanying condensed balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company is obligated to pay a success bonus of $77,500 to Mr. Leggett upon the consummation of a business combination. The Company is no longer obligated to pay a success bonus to Mr. Lasov, as the amounts previously expensed under his agreement has exceeded the bonus amount.\n\n28\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies**\n\nThis management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our unaudited financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our unaudited financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to fair value of financial instruments and accrued expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\n_Warrant Liabilities_\n\nThe Company accounts for the Warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the specific terms of the Warrants and the applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815. The assessment considers whether they are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the Warrants are indexed to the Company’s own ordinary shares and whether the holders of the Warrants could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of issuance of the Warrants and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the Warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, such warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, such warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of liability-classified warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statement of operations.\n\n_Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption_\n\nClass A ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Class A ordinary shares (including Class A ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company’s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Class A ordinary shares are classified as shareholders’ equity. Our Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 1,841,950 and 6,157,215, shares of Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption, respectively, are presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders’ deficit section of the Company’s condensed balance sheets.\n\n_Net Income (Loss) Per Ordinary Share_\n\nBasic income (loss) per ordinary share is computed by dividing net income applicable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Consistent with ASC 480, ordinary shares subject to possible redemption, as well as their pro rata share of undistributed trust earnings consistent with the two-class method, have been excluded from the calculation of income per ordinary share for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of trust earnings. Diluted income per share includes the incremental number of ordinary shares to be issued to settle warrants, as calculated using the treasury method. For the period from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any dilutive warrants, securities or other contracts that could potentially, be exercised or converted into ordinary shares. As a result, diluted income per ordinary share is the same as basic income (loss) per ordinary share for all periods presented.\n\n29\n\n _Recently Adopted Accounting Standard_\n\nIn August 2020 the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06 Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815–40) (“ASU 2020-06”). ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity’s own equity. The ASU is part of the FASB’s simplification initiative, which aims to reduce unnecessary complexity in GAAP. The ASU’s amendments are effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2024. The Company’s management does not believe that the adoption of ASU 2020-06 had a material impact on the Company’s unaudited condensed financial statements and disclosures.\n\n_Recently Issued Accounting Standards_\n\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.\n\n_JOBS Act_\n\nOn April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected to irrevocably opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we will adopt the new or revised standard at the time public companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another emerging growth company that has not opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.\n\nAdditionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an “emerging growth company”, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive Officer’s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our Public Offering or until we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” whichever is earlier.\n\n**Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.**\n\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item.\n\n30\n\n**Item 4. Controls and Procedures.**\n\n_Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures_\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below.\n\nAs previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, that was filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024, our management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting due to the fact that we did not have the necessary business processes and related internal controls formally designed and implemented related to accrued expenses and accounts payable. As a result, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles including implementing the remediation activities as described below. A new instance of an existing material weakness was identified during the period related to the classification of related party payables. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this Form 10-Q present fairly in all material respects our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the period presented.\n\nDisclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\n_Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting_\n\n _Historical Remediation Activities_\n\nAs previously disclosed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, management identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting related to accrued expenses and accounts payable.\n\nThe Company has performed the following remediation activities to confirm its accounts payable obligations:\n\n●| We confirmed that no member of management or advisor providing services to the Company has unsubmitted or unreimbursed expenses or fees, and  \n---|---  \n●| We confirmed that the Company was current with its payables to its service providers.  \n---|---  \n  \nWe are committed to ensuring that our internal controls are designed and operating effectively. Management believes the efforts taken to date and the planned remediation will improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. While these remediation efforts are ongoing, the controls must also be operating effectively for a sufficient period of time and be tested by management in order to consider them remediated and conclude that the controls are operating effectively to address the risks of material misstatement.\n\n_Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting_\n\nExcept for the steps taken as part of the remediation activities described above, there have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n31\n\n**PART II - OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**Item 1. Legal Proceedings.**\n\nWe are not a party to any material legal proceedings and no material legal proceedings have been threatened by us or, to the best of our knowledge, against us.\n\n**Item 1A Risk Factors.**\n\nFactors that could cause our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition to differ materially from the descriptions provided in this report include the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024. In addition, the following risk factor could also have such an effect.\n\n**_A 1% U.S. federal excise tax may decrease the value of our securities following an initial business combination, or hinder our ability to consummate an initial business combination._**\n\nPursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IR Act”), commencing in 2023, a 1% U.S. federal excise tax is imposed on certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock by publicly traded domestic (i.e., U.S.) corporations and certain domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation and not on its shareholders. The amount of the excise tax is equal to 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. Although we are a Cayman Islands company, the excise tax may apply in connection with redemptions or other repurchases that occur in connection with an initial business combination that involves our combination with a U.S. entity and/or our domestication as a U.S. corporation (a “Redemption Event”). In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by us and not by the redeeming holders, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax remains to be determined. Any excise tax payable by us in connection with a Redemption Event may cause a reduction in the cash available to us to complete an initial business combination and could affect our ability to complete an initial business combination** _._**\n\n**_The SEC has recently issued final rules to regulate special purpose acquisition companies. Certain of the procedures that we, a potential business combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with such proposals may increase our costs and the time needed to complete our initial business combination and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete a business combination._**\n\nOn January 24, 2024, the SEC issued final rules (the “SPAC Rules”) relating to, among other things, disclosures in business combination transactions between special purpose acquisition companies (“SPACs”) such as us and private operating companies; the condensed financial statement requirements applicable to transactions involving shell companies; and the use of projections by SPACs in SEC filings in connection with proposed business combination transactions. The SPAC Rules became effective 125 days after their publication in the Federal Register. In connection with the issuance of the SPAC Rules, the SEC also issued guidance (the “SPAC Guidance”) regarding the potential liability of certain participants in proposed business combination transactions and the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“Investment Company Act”) based on certain facts and circumstances such as duration, asset composition, sources of income, business purpose and activities of the SPAC and its management team in furtherance of such goals.\n\nCertain of the procedures that we, a potential business combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with the SPAC Rules, or pursuant to the SEC’s views expressed in the SPAC Guidance, may increase the costs and the time required to consummate a business combination, and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete a business combination.\n\n32\n\n** _If we were deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we may be forced to abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead be required to liquidate and dissolve the Company._**\n\nAs described above, the SPAC Guidance relates to, among other things, the circumstances in which SPACs such as us could potentially be subject to the Investment Company Act and the regulations thereunder. Whether a SPAC is an investment company will be a question of facts and circumstances under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act. A specific duration period of a SPAC is not the sole determinant, but one of the long-standing factors to consider in determination of a SPAC’s status under the Investment Company Act. A SPAC could be deemed as an investment company at any stage of its operation. The determination of a SPAC’s status as an investment company includes analysis of a SPAC’s activities, depending upon the facts and circumstances, including but not limited to, the nature of SPAC assets and income, the activities of a SPAC’s officers, directors and employees, the duration of a SPAC, the manner a SPAC holding itself out to investors, and the merging with an investment company.\n\nIt is possible that a claim could be made that we have been operating as an unregistered investment company, including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, based on the current views of the SEC. If we were deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we might be forced to abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead be required to liquidate the Company. If we are required to liquidate the Company, our investors would not be able to realize the benefits of owning shares in a successor operating business, including the potential appreciation in the value of our shares and warrants following such a transaction, and our warrants would expire worthless.\n\nIn an effort to mitigate the risk that we may be deemed to have been operating as an unregistered investment company under the Investment Company Act, we instructed Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the trustee with respect to the Trust Account, to liquidate the U.S. government securities held in the Trust Account in November 2023 and to thereafter hold all funds in the Trust Account in an interest bearing demand deposit account until the earlier of the consummation of our Business Combination or our liquidation. There can be no assurance that this action will foreclose a judicial or regulatory finding, or an allegation, that the Company is an investment company.\n\n**_Termination of the Transactions could negatively impact Blue Ocean._**\n\nIf the Transactions are not completed for any reason, including as a result of our shareholders declining to approve the proposals required to effect the Transactions, our ongoing business may be adversely impacted and, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Transactions, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\n●| we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our share price (including to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Transactions will be completed);  \n---|---  \n●| we will have incurred substantial expenses and will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Transactions, whether or not the Transactions are completed; and  \n---|---  \n●| since the Merger Agreement restricts the conduct of our businesses prior to completion of the Merger, we may not be able to take certain actions during the pendency of the Merger that would benefit us as an independent company, and the opportunity to take such actions may no longer be available.  \n---|---  \n  \n33\n\nIf the Transactions are terminated and our board of directors seeks another business combination target, our shareholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find another acquisition target that would constitute a business combination or that such other business combination will be completed.\n\n**_The Transactions may be more difficult, costly, or time-consuming than expected, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Transactions._**\n\nTo realize the anticipated benefits from the Transactions, we must successfully integrate and combine our business with that of TNL Mediagene. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the Transactions may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, the actual benefits of the Transactions could be less than anticipated, and integration may result in additional unforeseen expenses. In addition, we and TNL Mediagene have operated and, until the completion of the Transactions, must continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of one or more key employees, the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies that adversely affect each company’s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Transactions. Integration efforts between the companies may also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the Company during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the Transactions.\n\n**Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.**\n\nOn June 21, 2024, the Company issued an aggregate of 4,353,749 Class A ordinary shares to the Sponsor upon the conversion of an equal number of Class B ordinary shares and an aggregate of 390,000 Class A ordinary shares to Norman Pearlstine, Joel Motley, Matt Goldberg, Priscilla Han, Apollo Credit Strategies Master Fund Ltd. and other holders of the Company’s Class B ordinary shares upon the conversion of an equal number of Class B ordinary shares. The Class A ordinary shares issued in connection with the Conversion are subject to the same restrictions applicable to the Class B ordinary shares prior to the Conversion, including, among other things, certain transfer restrictions, waiver of redemption rights and the obligation to vote in favor of an initial business combination. Following the Conversion, the Company had a total of 6,585,699 Class A ordinary shares outstanding, of which 1,841,950 were redeemable Class A ordinary shares, and one Class B ordinary share outstanding.\n\n**Item 3. Default Upon Senior Securities.**\n\nNone.\n\n**Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.**\n\nNot applicable.\n\n**Item 5. Other Information.**\n\nNone.\n\n34\n\n**Item 6.

Honest, Ethical and Fair Conduct\nEach person owes a duty to the Company to act with integrity. Integrity requires, among\nother things, being honest, fair and candid.

Employees are responsible for talking to their\nsupervisors to determine which laws, regulations and Company policies apply to their position and\nwhat training is necessary to understand and comply with them.\nDirectors, officers and employees are directed to specific policies and procedures available\nto persons they supervise.\n3\n5. Reporting and Accountability\nThe Board is responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions\nare presented to it and has the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. Any\nperson who becomes aware of any existing or potential breach of this Code is required to notify\nthe Chairman promptly. Failure to do so is, in and of itself, a breach of this Code.\nSpecifically, each person must:\n• notify the Chairman promptly of any existing or potential violation of this Code; and\n• not retaliate against any other person for reports of potential violations that are made\nin good faith.\nThe Company will follow the following procedures in investigating and enforcing this\nCode and in reporting on this Code:\n• the Board will take all appropriate action to investigate any potential or actual breaches\nreported to it; and\n• upon determination by the Board that a breach has occurred, the Board (by majority\ndecision) will take or authorize such disciplinary or preventive action as it deems\nappropriate, after consultation with the Company’s internal or external legal counsel,\nup to and including dismissal or, in the event of criminal or other serious violations of\nlaw, notification of the SEC or other appropriate law enforcement authorities.\nNo person following the above procedure shall, as a result of following such procedure, be\nsubject by the Company or any officer or employee thereof to discharge, demotion suspension,\nthreat, harassment or, in any manner, discrimination against such person in terms and conditions\nof employment.\n6. Waivers and Amendments\nAny waiver (defined below) or implicit waiver (defined below) from a provision of this\nCode for the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or\ncontroller, or persons performing similar functions or any amendment (as defined below) to this\nCode is required to be disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8- K filed with the SEC.

An “amendment” means any amendment to this\nCode other than minor technical, administrative or other non-substantive amendments hereto.\n4\nAll persons should note that it is not the Company’s intention to grant or to permit waivers\nfrom the requirements of this Code. The Company expects full compliance with this Code.\n7. Insider Information and Securities Trading\nThe Company’s directors, officers or employees who have access to material, non-public\ninformation are not permitted to use that information for securities trading purposes or for any\npurpose unrelated to the Company’s business. It is also against the law to trade or to “tip” others\nwho might make an investment decision based on material, non-public information. For example,\nusing material, non-public information to buy or sell the Company securities, options in the\nCompany securities or the securities of any Company supplier, customer, competitor, potential\nbusiness partner or potential target is prohibited. The consequences of insider trading violations\ncan be severe. These rules also apply to the use of material, nonpublic information about other\ncompanies (including, for example, the Company’s customers, competitors, potential business\npartners and potential targets). In addition to directors, officers or employees, these rules apply to\nsuch person’s spouse, children, parents and siblings, as well as any other family members living\nin such person’s home.

In accordance with those policies, in the event of litigation or governmental\ninvestigation, please consult the Board or the Company’s internal or external legal counsel.\n9. Improper Influence on Conduct of Audits\nNo director or officer, or any other person acting under the direction thereof, shall directly\nor indirectly take any action to coerce, manipulate, mislead or fraudulently influence any public or\ncertified public accountant engaged in the performance of an audit or review of the financial\nstatements of the Company or take any action that such person knows or should know that if\nsuccessful could result in rendering the Company’s financial statements materially misleading.\nAny person who believes such improper influence is being exerted should report such action to\nsuch person’s supervisor, or if that is impractical under the circumstances, to any of the Company’s\ndirectors.\nTypes of conduct that could constitute improper influence include, but are not limited to,\ndirectly or indirectly:\n• offering or paying bribes or other financial incentives, including future employment or\ncontracts for non-audit services;\n5\n• providing an auditor with an inaccurate or misleading legal analysis;\n• threatening to cancel or canceling existing non-audit or audit engagements if the auditor\nobjects to the Company’s accounting;\n• seeking to have a partner removed from the audit engagement because the partner\nobjects to the Company’s accounting;\n• blackmailing; and\n• making physical threats.\n10. Anti-Corruption Laws\nThe Company complies with the anti-corruption laws of the countries in which it does\nbusiness, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (“FCPA”).

If you are authorized to engage agents on the Company’s behalf, you are\nresponsible for ensuring they are reputable and for obtaining a written agreement for them to\nuphold the Company’s standards in this area.\n11. Violations\nViolation of this Code is grounds for disciplinary action up to and including termination of\nemployment. Such action is in addition to any civil or criminal liability which might be imposed\nby any court or regulatory agency.\n12.
