(Nasdaq: KE) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30,**  \n(Amounts in Thousands, except EPS)  |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nNet Sales  |  $  |  374,256  |  $  |  438,081   \nOperating Income  |  $  |  9,115  |  $  |  19,490   \nAdjusted Operating Income (non-GAAP)  (1) |  $  |  12,590  |  $  |  21,006   \nOperating Income %  |  2.4  |  %  |  4.4  |  %   \nAdjusted Operating Income (non-GAAP) %  |  3.4  |  %  |  4.8  |  %   \nNet Income  |  $  |  3,154  |  $  |  10,754   \nAdjusted Net Income (non-GAAP) (1) |  $  |  5,527  |  $  |  12,038   \nDiluted EPS  |  $  |  0.12  |  $  |  0.43   \nAdjusted Diluted EPS (non-GAAP) (1) |  $  |  0.22  |  $  |  0.48   \n_(1)_ |  _Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, adjusted results exclude stock compensation expense. Prior reported periods have been revised accordingly. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is included below._  \n---|---  \n  \nCommenting on today’s announcement, Richard D. Phillips, Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Q1 represents another chapter of ‘controlling what we can control’ while navigating the challenging operating environment stemming from sustained end market weakness. Our results for the quarter were in line with expectations, considering the difficult comparisons from a record-setting Q1 last year. We continue to adjust costs, improve working capital management, and generate positive cash flow used to pay down debt. We made meaningful progress in the quarter with debt levels at a 2-year low, a result of the cash generated from operating activities and the proceeds from the disposition of the Automation, Test, and Measurement business, with its divestiture closing in July.” \n\nMr. Phillips continued, “As part of sharpening our strategic focus, we’re also announcing a plan to leverage the capacity in our global footprint and further streamline the operating structure. Production activities on existing customer programs will be transferred out of Tampa, with the majority of the work going to the newly expanded facility in Mexico and Jasper. Operations in Tampa are expected to cease by the end of the fiscal year, and we anticipate the facility closing in Q1 of fiscal 2026. We are grateful to the employees in Tampa and their accomplishments while part of Kimball, including supplying ventilators to those in need during the pandemic. This decision is based on the preferences of our customers, our outlook for US manufacturing, and an objective to improve the Company’s competitive positioning in the market, strengthen the balance sheet, increase liquidity, and improve financial flexibility. We are confirming our guidance for the full fiscal year and look forward to the future.” \n\nThe Company ended the first quarter of fiscal 2025 with cash and cash equivalents of $76.6 million and borrowings outstanding on credit facilities of $245.9 million, including $200.0 million classified as long term. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $186.8 million of borrowing capacity available. Cash generated from operating activities in the first quarter totaled $45.5 million and capital expenditures were $13.5 million, and the Company invested $2.9 million to repurchase 160,000 shares of common stock. \n\nNet Sales by Vertical Market for Q1 Fiscal 2025: \n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30,**  \n(Amounts in Millions)  |  **2024** |  *  |  **2023** |  *  |  **Percent Change**  \nAutomotive  |  $  |  188.4  |  50%  |  $  |  212.5  |  49%  |  (11)%   \nMedical  |  89.8  |  24%  |  102.4  |  23%  |  (12)%   \nIndustrial excluding AT&M  (1) |  94.0  |  25%  |  112.9  |  26%  |  (17)%   \nNet Sales excluding AT&M (1) |  $  |  372.2  |  99%  |  $  |  427.8  |  98%  |  (13)%   \nAT&M (1) |  2.1  |  1%  |  10.3  |  2%  |  (80)%   \nTotal Net Sales  |  $  |  374.3  |  $  |  438.1  |  (15)%   \n* _As a percent of Total Net Sales_  \n_(1) Sales from our Automation, Test, and Measurement business (AT &M), which was divested effective July 31, 2024, were previously included in the Industrial vertical_  \n– _Automotive includes electronic power steering, body controls, automated driver assist systems, and electronic braking systems_  \n– _Medical includes sleep therapy and respiratory care, image guided therapy, in vitro diagnostics, drug delivery, AED, and patient monitoring_  \n– _Industrial includes climate controls, automation controls, and public safety_  \n  \nCompany guidance for fiscal year 2025: \n\n  * Net sales in the range of $1.440 - $1.540 billion, an 8% to 14% decline year-over-year when excluding net sales from Automation, Test, and Measurement \n  * Adjusted operating income of 4.0% - 4.5% of net sales (a)\n  * Capital expenditures of $40 - $50 million \n\n(a) |  Fiscal year 2025 guidance reflects a change in our adjusted operating income calculation beginning in fiscal year 2025, which excludes stock compensation expense.

We deliver a package of value that begins with our core\ncompetency of producing durable electronics and further offer contract manufacturing services for non-electronic components,\nmedical disposables, drug delivery solutions and precision molded plastics. Our design and manufacturing expertise coupled\nwith robust processes and procedures help us ensure that we deliver the highest levels of quality and reliability throughout the\nentire life cycle of our customers’ products. We deliver award-winning service across our global footprint with an operations\nplatform driven by highly integrated procedures, standardization, and teamwork. Our Customer Relationship Management\n(“CRM”) model is key to providing our customers convenient access to our global footprint and all of our services throughout\nthe entire product life cycle. Because they operate in industries that demand rigorous engineering controls and that commonly\nrequire long product life cycles, our customers rely on our track record of quality, international standard certifications, financial\nstability, social responsibility, and commitment to long-term relationships.\nFor over 35 years, we have manufactured safety-critical electronic assemblies for automotive customers, developing invaluable\nexpertise that extends beyond the automotive industry to benefit our medical and industrial customers as well. By harnessing\nour experience and expertise in design and process validation, traceability, process and control change, as well as lean\nmanufacturing, we have achieved substantial growth and diversification.\nMany of our customers are multinational companies operating across multiple global regions, and they maximize their supplier\nrelationship by partnering with us for engineering, manufacturing, and supply chain services and support across multiple\nlocations and regions. We leverage key supply chain advantages and streamline our operations, enabling cost-effective\nmanufacturing of both electronic and non-electronic products within a single production facility for customers from all three\nend market verticals. Coupled with our CRM model and our global systems, procedures, processes, and teamwork, our strategic\napproach to expanding our global footprint aligns with our customers’ preferences in our three end market verticals. This\npositions us strongly to support their global growth initiatives.\n3\nOur customers benefit from consistent supply chain processes across all regions thanks to our global component sourcing,\nprocurement, quoting, and customer pricing operations. Our central sourcing organization employs global procurement\nstrategies that ensure consistent component availability and a uniform pricing approach by leveraging the purchasing volume of\nour entire organization. Our unified, global quoting model allows us to seamlessly respond to our customers’ production needs\nanywhere across our global footprint.\nWe combine cross-functional teams from multiple facilities in quality, operational excellence, quoting, and design engineering\nglobal support with our business development team members located in-region with our global customers. Clear roles and\nresponsibilities, combined with diverse skill sets, establish a robust conduit critical for executing our customers’ objectives and\nbuilding strong customer relationships. Our robust customer scorecard process provides valuable feedback to all levels of our\ncompany, driving continuous improvement initiatives, strengthening our award-winning service, and fostering deep customer\nloyalty. Our customers trust and value our people, our deep-rooted Guiding Principles, and our sustainability policies.\nOur corporate headquarters is located at 1205 Kimball Boulevard, Jasper, Indiana. We manufacture products for our customers\nat facilities located in the United States, China, Mexico, Poland, Romania, and Thailand. As discussed in the Our Business\nStrategy section below, we completed the divestiture of our automation, test, and measurement business on July 31, 2024, prior\nto which those subsidiaries manufactured products in China and Vietnam and maintained operations in India and Japan.\nWe offer our services globally on a contract basis, and we manufacture products to our customers’ specifications. Our services\nprimarily include:\n• Production and testing of printed circuit board assemblies (PCBAs);\n• High-level and final assembly of medical, automotive, and industrial products;\n• Design services and support;\n• Supply chain services and support;\n• Rapid prototyping and new product introduction support;\n• Product design and process validation and qualification;\n• Industrialization and automation of manufacturing processes;\n• Reliability testing (testing of products under a series of extreme environmental conditions);\n• Aftermarket services;\n• Production and assembly of medical devices, medical disposables including packaging, and other non-electronic\nproducts;\n• Drug delivery devices and solutions with and without electronics;\n• Class 7 and 8 clean room assembly, cold chain and product sterilization management;\n• Design engineering and production of precision molded plastics; and\n• Complete product life cycle management.\nWe take pride in our attentive approach to understanding and adapting to our customers’ ever-changing needs and preferences.\nWe continuously seek opportunities to grow and diversify our business and the value we deliver to customers while enhancing\nour global presence.\nReporting Segment\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is\nevaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and\nassessing performance. Each of our business units qualifies as an operating segment with its results regularly reviewed by our\nchief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer. Our operating segments meet the aggregation criteria under the\naccounting guidance for segment reporting. As of June 30, 2024, all of our operating segments provided contract manufacturing\nservices, including engineering and supply chain support, for the production of electronic assemblies and other products\nincluding medical devices, medical disposables, precision molded plastics, and automation, test, and inspection equipment\nprimarily in automotive, medical, and industrial applications, to the specifications and designs of our customers. The nature of\nthe products, the production process, the type of customers, and the methods used to distribute the products have similar\ncharacteristics across all our operating segments. Each of our operating segments serves customers in multiple markets, and\nmany of our customers’ programs are manufactured and serviced by multiple operating segments. We leverage global processes\nsuch as component procurement and customer pricing that provide commonality and consistency among the various regions in\nwhich we operate. All of our operating segments have similar long-term economic characteristics, and as such, have been\naggregated into one reportable segment.\n4\nOur Business Strategy\nWe intend to achieve sustained, profitable growth in the markets we serve by supporting the global growth initiatives of our\ncustomers as a multifaceted manufacturing solutions company. Key elements of executing our strategy include:\n• Leveraging Our Global Footprint – responding to customer demand through our presence in key regions with\nexisting facilities, which we focus on expanding, and our consideration of potential new geographic regions;\n• Expanding Our Package of Value – enhancing our core contract manufacturing services strengths and expanding\nour package of value in areas such as complex system assembly, specialized processes, and precision molded\nplastics with particular emphasis on Kimball medical solutions;\n• Expanding Our Markets – exploring opportunities and making investments that will broaden existing or establish\nnew markets.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we made the decision to divest GES, our automation, test and measurement business\nunit, and committed to a plan to sell the business, allowing for increased focus and support for the Company’s core operations.\nWe completed the divestiture of the GES business to Averna Technologies Inc. on July 31, 2024. See Note 3 - Assets and\nLiabilities Held for Sale of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on this divestiture.\nOur Business Offerings\nWe offer electronics manufacturing services, including engineering and supply chain support, to customers in the automotive,\nmedical, and industrial end market verticals. We further offer contract manufacturing services for non-electronic components,\nmedical disposables, and precision molded plastics. Our services support the complete product life cycle of our customers’\nproducts, and our processes and capabilities cover a range of products from high volume-low mix to high mix-low volume. We\nbring innovative, complete design solutions to our customers. We offer Design for Excellence input to our customers as a part\nof our standard package of value. We use sophisticated software tools to integrate the supply chain in a way that provides our\ncustomers with the flexibility their business requires. Our robust new product introduction process and our extensive\nmanufacturing capabilities give us the ability to execute to the various quality and reliability expectations of our customers in\neach of our end market verticals. We are committed to protecting the planet by combating climate change, including\ncontributing to a lower carbon future, in our operations, our value chains, and in the services we offer to our customers. Our\nstrategies include actions to optimize our manufacturing facilities and processes for sustainability, increase clean energy in our\npurchased power mix, collaborate with our customers and supply chain to address upstream and downstream carbon emissions,\ninvest in clean energy solutions for climate protection, and offer low carbon and clean technology products, technologies and\nservices.\nWe value our customers and their unique needs and expectations. Our customer focus and dedication to unparalleled excellence\nin engineering and manufacturing has resulted in proven success in the contract manufacturing industry. Personal relationships\nare important to us, and we strive to build long-term global partnerships. Our commitment to support our customers is backed\nby our history and demonstrated performance for over the past 60 years.\nMarketing Channels\nManufacturing services, including engineering and supply chain support, are marketed by our business development team. We\nuse a CRM model to provide our customers with convenient access to both our global footprint and all of our services\nthroughout the entire product life cycle.\nMajor Competitive Factors\nKey competitive factors in the markets we serve include quality and reliability, engineering design services, production\nflexibility, on-time delivery, customer lead time, test capability, competitive pricing, and global presence. Numerous contract\nmanufacturing service providers compete globally for business from existing and potential customers. We also face competition\nfrom our customers’ own capacity and capabilities to in-source production. The proliferation of electronic components in\ntoday’s advanced products and the continuing trend by original equipment manufacturers in the electronics industry to\nsubcontract the assembly process to companies with a core competency in this area drive growth in our industry. The nature of\nthe EMS industry is such that the start-up of new customers and new programs to replace expiring programs occurs frequently.\nNew customers and program start-ups generally cause margin dilution early in the life of a program, which is often recovered as\nthe program becomes established and matures. Our continuing success depends upon our ability to replace expiring customers/\nprograms with new customers/programs.\n5\nWe, and the industry in general, have special conditions affecting working capital that are significant for understanding our\nbusiness, including fluctuating inventory levels, which may increase in conjunction with the start-up of new programs and\ncomponent availability. Additionally, the nature of the contract manufacturing business is such that customers may be required\nto make advance payments for certain inventory purchases and share in the risk of excess and obsolete inventory.\nOur Competitive Strengths\nWe derive our competitive strengths from our experience of producing safety critical electronic assemblies for automotive\ncustomers for over 35 years and leveraging this experience to create valuable and innovative solutions for customers in different\nindustries. Our strengths include:\n• Core competency of producing durable electronics;\n• Body of knowledge in the design and manufacture of products that require high levels of quality control,\nreliability, and durability;\n• Highly integrated, global footprint;\n• Fully integrated engineering, manufacturing and supply chain services as the contract manufacturing organization\n(“CMO”) for our customers’ non-electronic components, medical disposables, and precision molded plastics;\n• CRM model and our customer scorecard process;\n• Ability to provide our customers with valuable design input for improved manufacturability, reliability, and cost;\n• Quality systems, industry certifications, and regulatory compliance;\n• Integrated supply chain solutions and competitive bid processes that result in competitive raw material pricing;\nand\n• Complete product life cycle management.\nCompetitors\nNumerous manufacturers in the EMS industry compete for business from existing and potential customers. Our competition\nincludes EMS companies such as Benchmark Electronics, Inc., Flex Ltd., Jabil Inc., Plexus Corp., and Sanmina Corporation.\nWe do not have a significant share of the EMS market and were ranked the 18th largest global EMS provider for calendar year\n2023 by Manufacturing Market Insider in the April 2024 edition published by New Venture Research.\nLocations\nAs of August 23, 2024, we have nine manufacturing facilities with two located in Indiana, one in China, two in Mexico, and\none located in each of Florida, Poland, Romania, and Thailand. Prior to the divestiture of our automation, test, and\nmeasurement business, GES, on July 31, 2024, we also operated manufacturing facilities in Vietnam and China, performed\nsoftware design services primarily at a location in India, and provided other support engineering services at locations in\nCalifornia and Japan. We continually assess our capacity needs and evaluate our operations to optimize our service levels for\nsupporting our customers’ needs around the globe, and we have recently expanded our facilities in Thailand, Mexico, and\nPoland. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for information regarding financial and operational risks related to our international\noperations.\nSeasonality\nConsolidated sales revenue is generally not affected by seasonality.\nCustomers\nWhile the total electronic assemblies market has broad applications, our customers are concentrated in the automotive, medical,\nand industrial end markets. Beginning in fiscal year 2024, the Company changed its presentation of revenue for miscellaneous\nsales previously included in Other to include in the respective customers’ end market verticals. Prior year periods have been\nrecast to conform to the current year presentation.\n6\nSales by industry as a percent of net sales for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2024 were as follows:\nYear Ended June 30\n2024 2023 2022\nAutomotive . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 48% 46% 44%\nMedical . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25% 28% 29%\nIndustrial . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27% 26% 27%\nTotal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100% 100% 100%\nIncluded in our sales were a significant amount to Nexteer Automotive, Philips, and ZF, which accounted for the following\nportions of net sales:\nYear Ended June 30\n2024 2023 2022\nNexteer Automotive . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16% 15% 17%\nPhilips . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . * 14% 15%\nZF . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13% 12% *\n* amount is less than 10% of total\nThe nature of the contract manufacturing business is such that start-up of new programs to replace expiring programs occurs\nfrequently. Our agreements with customers are often not for a definitive term and are amended and extended, but generally\ncontinue for the relevant product’s life cycle, which can be difficult to predict at the beginning of a program. Typically, our\ncustomer agreements do not commit the customer to purchase our services until a short time before we begin performing those\nservices. Our customers generally have the right to cancel a particular program subject to contractual provisions governing\ntermination, the final product runs, excess or obsolete inventory, and end-of-life pricing, which reduce the additional costs that\nwe incur when a manufacturing services agreement is terminated.\nRaw Materials\nRaw materials utilized in the manufacture of contract electronic products are generally readily available from both domestic and\nforeign sources, although from time to time the industry experiences shortages of certain components due to supply and demand\nforces, combined with rapid product life cycles of certain components. In addition, unforeseen events such as natural disasters\nand global events, like pandemics, can and have disrupted portions of the supply chain. We believe that maintaining close\ncommunication with suppliers helps minimize potential disruption in our supply chain.\nThe EMS industry has experienced component shortages, component allocations, and shipping delays, particularly with\nsemiconductors, in recent fiscal years. Further component shortages or allocations could increase component costs and\npotentially interrupt our operations and negatively impact our ability to meet commitments to customers. We take various\nactions to attempt to mitigate the risk and minimize the impact to our customers as well as the adverse effect component\nshortages, component allocations, or shipping delays could have on our results. Through contractual pricing arrangements and\nnegotiations with our customers, we attempt to mitigate the adverse effect that cost increases could have on our results.\nRaw materials are normally acquired for specific customer orders and often are not interchangeable among products. Inherent\nrisks associated with rapid technological changes within this our industry are mitigated by procuring raw materials, for the most\npart, based on firm orders. In certain instances, such as when lead times dictate, we enter into contractual agreements for\nmaterial in excess of the levels required to fulfill customer orders. In turn, material authorization agreements with customers\ncover a portion of the exposure for material that we must purchase prior to having a firm order. We may also purchase\nadditional inventory to support new product introductions, transfers of production between manufacturing facilities, and to\nmitigate the potential impact from component shortages.\n7\nIntellectual Property\nOur primary intellectual property is our proprietary manufacturing technology and processes that allow us to provide\ncompetitive contract manufacturing and design services to our customers. As such, this intellectual property is complex and\nnormally contained within our facilities. To protect our trade secrets, our manufacturing technology and processes, and other\nproprietary rights, we rely primarily on a combination of intellectual property laws pertaining to trade secrets and copyrights;\nnon-disclosure agreements with our customers, employees, and suppliers; and our internal security procedures and systems. We\nfeel that relying on trade secret or copyright protections is a superior strategy because there is no disclosure of the information\nto outside parties, and protections do not expire after a length of time. We also maintain trademark rights (including\nregistrations) for “Kimball Electronics,” and other wordmarks and trademarks that we use in our business in the United States\nand around the world. We have policies and procedures to identify and protect our own intellectual property and that of our\ncustomers and suppliers.\nCorporate Social Responsibility\nWe are committed to responsible, sustainable environmental, social, and governance philosophies and practices, which have\nbeen a part of our fabric since our founding in 1961. To showcase how our employees around the world share a strong sense of\nresponsibility to protect the environment, sustain a safety focus at our facilities, and give back in meaningful ways to the\ncommunities where we live and work, we issued our latest annual Guiding Principles Report in March 2024. The Report\nhighlights the long-term environmental, social, and governance principles and practices designed to support the Company’s\ncommitment to sustaining lasting relationships and achieving global success with its stakeholders wherever Kimball\nElectronics’ touch is felt throughout the world. The Report reflects several long-standing Guiding Principles of the Company:\nour customer is our business; our people are the company; the environment is our home; we strive to help our communities be\ngreat places to live; profitability and financial resources give us the freedom to shape our future and achieve our vision. The\nReport is posted on our website at https://www.kimballelectronics.com/sustainability. The Company’s website and the\ninformation contained therein, or incorporated therein, are not intended to be incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-\nK.\nSocially Responsible Supply Chain\nWe are committed to the use of a socially responsible supply chain to reduce the risk of human rights violations and the use of\nconflict minerals (tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold, or “3TG”) from the Democratic Republic of Congo and certain adjoining\ncountries. Our efforts include requiring our suppliers to undertake reasonable due diligence within their supply chain to ensure\nthat the 3TG in the materials we source from them do not directly or indirectly contribute to significant adverse human rights\nimpacts, as well as conducting due diligence before allowing a potential supplier to become one of our preferred suppliers. We\nrequest the return of reporting forms related to conflict minerals from our suppliers under the Responsible Minerals Initiative,\nor RMI, Conflict Minerals Survey. Further, we seek to remove any suppliers that continue to fail to meet our supplier and\nconflict minerals policies after being provided the opportunity to remedy non-compliance via implementation of a corrective\naction plan. We also conduct recurring, annual training for all employees and certain select contractors on export compliance,\nanti-corruption and anti-slavery, and insider trading. In addition, Kimball Electronics is a member of the RMI, which is\nevaluating the supply chain risks of conflict minerals and other minerals (e.g., cobalt, mica) and studying how to mitigate those\nrisks.\nHuman Rights\nAs reflected in our Vision and Guiding Principles, Kimball Electronics is committed to the highest standards of conduct in its\nbusiness dealings. We are a human-centered company that fully supports human rights. For us, human rights are more than just\nbeing compliant--they are about doing the right thing. Our Guiding Principles outline the critical role Kimball plays as a\ncorporate citizen for our customers, our people, our partners, our environment, our Share Owners, and our communities. Our\nhuman rights beliefs are deeply rooted in our Guiding Principles and expressed in our Global Human Rights Policy, which is\nsupported by annual review that explains some of the practical actions that we take each year to implement our Policy.\nKimball has been built upon the tradition of pride in craftsmanship, mutual trust, personal integrity, respect for dignity of the\nindividual, a spirit of cooperation, and a sense of family and good humor. We seek to enhance this culture as we grow. We\nbelieve that no company should prosper while violating the basic human rights of others whether through unlawful slavery,\nservitude, forced or compulsory labor, or otherwise exploitative means. We believe in upholding principles of human rights,\nfair remuneration and economic inclusion, fair labor practices, worker safety, and observing fair labor practices within our\norganization and our supply chain.\n8\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging\nWe value and work to promote a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment. We are committed to holding ourselves\naccountable, taking action to continuously improve our policies and practices, and to uphold the principles that encompass\ndiversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging as outlined in our Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (“DEI&B”) statement.\nOur strategy is to achieve excellence in customer service, employee relations, and business objectives through creativity,\nresponsiveness, and innovation as a result of increased well-being, sense of belonging, and meaningful work for our employees.\nWe actively promote DEI&B, and incorporate DEI&B into our culture, values, and strategies. We provide a report on the\ndiversity of our employees to our Board, in our Guiding Principles Report, and in our 2023 Talent Attraction & Retention report\non our website at https://www.kimballelectronics.com/sustainability.\nContributing to Our Communities\nOne of our Guiding Principles is to strive to help our communities be great places to live. We live this Guiding Principle and\nfurther the goals of our Human Rights Policy and our Global Policy on Philanthropic Contributions and Non-Commercial\nSponsorships when we contribute and encourage our employees to contribute to our local communities. Our contributions are\nintended to support the communities in which we operate, those who may not be in a position to directly benefit from\nemployment with us or from our primary business activities, or those who can benefit from the value derived from our support\nor collaboration. See the Giving section of our Guiding Principles Report for more information about the ways that we\nsupported a wide range of charitable and non-commercial causes through donations of time, talent, and treasure that align with\nour Guiding Principles.\nEnvironment and Energy Matters\nOur operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental and\necological matters. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with present laws and regulations and that there are no\nmaterial liabilities related to such items.\nWe are dedicated to excellence, leadership, and stewardship in protecting the environment and communities in which we have\noperations. We believe that continued compliance with foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations which have been\nenacted relating to the protection of the environment will not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or\ncompetitive position. Management believes capital expenditures for environmental control equipment will not represent a\nmaterial portion of total capital expenditures.\nOur operations require significant amounts of energy, including natural gas and electricity. Federal, foreign, and state\nregulations may control the allocation of fuels available to us, but to date we have experienced no interruption of production\ndue to such regulations.\nKimball Electronics participates in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) climate change and water security questionnaires to\nquantify our environmental practices, provide transparency on our progress, and assist in the reduction of our contributions to\nclimate change. Additionally, we publish disclosures in our annual Guiding Principles report that are written in accordance with\nthe Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and are aligned to the United Nations (UN) Sustainability Development Goals\n(SDG) and Global Compact (UNGC), the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Electronic Manufacturing Services\n& Original Design Manufacturing Standard, and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework.\nWe are members of the Responsible Minerals Initiative. We publish our sustainability report and our responses to the CDP\nclimate change and water security questionnaires annually on our website at kimballelectronics.com/sustainability. We publish\nthis information because our Guiding Principles remind us that the environment is our home and that we will be leaders in not\nonly protecting but enhancing our world. The contents of the sustainability reports and CDP questionnaire responses are not\nincorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC.\nRefer to the discussion in Item 1A - Risk Factors for further details of the legal and regulatory initiatives related to\nenvironmental matters including climate change that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial\ncondition.\nOur People are the Company: Human Capital Management\nWe believe our people are the company. We believe in creating quality for life. We believe lasting relationships create our\nglobal success. We believe our people are the competitive edge for our service, quality, and value. Kimball Electronics has been\nbuilt upon the tradition of pride in craftsmanship, mutual trust, personal integrity, respect for dignity of the individual, a spirit of\ncooperation, and a sense of family and good humor. We seek to enhance this culture as we grow. We believe in the inherent\nvalue of all individuals.\n9\nTo raise awareness of our commitment to human rights and to foster compliance with our Global Human Rights Policy, we\nhave incorporated it as an integral part of our Code of Conduct, train all of our employees worldwide on human rights issues,\nand require our suppliers, vendors, contractors, and partners to meet the same standards. To this end, through our Guiding\nPrinciples, we champion transparency and accountability for ourselves.\nBecause our people are the reason for our success, central to our long-term strategy is attracting, developing, and retaining the\nbest talent globally and strengthening collaboration. We are committed to pay equity and apply the principle of equal pay for\nwork of equal value in all regions where we operate. As of June 30, 2024, Kimball Electronics employed approximately 7,000\npeople worldwide, with approximately 1,200 located in the United States and approximately 5,800 located in foreign countries.\nCurrently, three of our seven independent members of the Board of Directors are female, along with four of our seven executive\nleadership team members and over 50% of our global workforce. We continue to execute on our commitment to diversity,\nequity, inclusion, and belonging, and exhibit our commitment to gender, racial, and ethnic diversity by striving toward the\ncorporate goals we outline in both our Global Human Rights Policy and Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging statement,\nincluding by:\n• Increasing female representation globally at the executive and senior management levels;\n• Maintaining an enterprise-wide target and expectation that 100% of the candidate slates for Board of Directors,\nexecutive, and director-level employee positions include candidates from underrepresented groups;\n• Holding leadership accountable for diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging outcomes.\nThe average tenure within our workforce is 7 years, and we work hard to mitigate turnover risk by consistently and formally\nsurveying our workforce about how well we are living up to our People Guiding Principles by asking them to anonymously rate\nus on a scale from 1 (low) to 10 (high). We currently have a score of 8.16 across our enterprise. We believe this is evidence that\nwe truly operate our business as our people are the company. We consistently have a participation rate in our Guiding\nPrinciples survey of approximately 87%. Upon completion of this survey every year, each local management team receives\nqualitative and quantitative feedback and are responsible for crafting improvement plans based on our people’s inputs.\nOur U.S. operations are not subject to collective bargaining arrangements. Certain foreign operations are subject to collective\nbargaining arrangements, many mandated by government regulation or customs of the particular countries. We believe that our\nemployee relations are good.\nFor additional information, see our definitive Proxy Statement to be filed no later than 120 days after the end of the Company’s\nfiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company makes available free of charge through its website, https://investors.kimballelectronics.com, its annual reports on\nForm 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and all amendments to those\nreports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and\nExchange Commission (“SEC”). All reports the Company files with the SEC are also available via the SEC website, http://\nwww.sec.gov. The Company’s website and the information contained therein, or incorporated therein, are not intended to be\nincorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n10\nItem 1A - Risk Factors\nThe following important risk factors, among others, could affect future results and events, causing results and events to differ\nmaterially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by\nmanagement from time to time. Such factors, among others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations and should be carefully considered. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not\ncurrently know about, we currently believe are immaterial, or we have not predicted may also affect our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations. Because of these and other factors, past performance should not be considered an indication\nof future performance.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nReduction of purchases by, or the loss of, one or more key customers could reduce revenues and profitability.\nLosses of key customers within specific industries or significant volume reductions from key customers are both risks. Our\ncontinuing success is dependent upon replacing expiring contract customers/programs with new customers/programs. See\n“Customers” in Item 1 - Business for disclosure of the net sales as a percentage of consolidated net sales for each of our\nsignificant customers during fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022. Regardless of whether our agreements with our customers,\nincluding our significant customers, have a definite term, our customers typically do not commit to firm production schedules\nfor more than one quarter. Our customers generally have the right to cancel a particular product, subject to contractual\nprovisions governing the final product runs, excess or obsolete inventory, recovery of dedicated investments, and end-of-life\npricing. As many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand, particularly a\nreduction in demand for a product that represents a significant amount of revenue, can harm our gross profit margins and results\nof operations.\nSignificant declines in the level of purchases by key customers or the loss of a significant number of customers could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business. As many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in\ncustomer demand, particularly a reduction in demand for a product that represents a significant amount of revenue, can harm\nour gross profit margins and results of operations.\nConsolidation among our customers exposes us to increased risks, including reduced revenue and dependence on a smaller\nnumber of customers. Consolidation in industries that utilize our services may occur as companies combine to achieve further\neconomies of scale and other synergies, which could result in an increase in excess manufacturing capacity as companies seek\nto divest manufacturing operations or eliminate duplicative product lines. Excess manufacturing capacity may increase pricing\nand competitive pressures for our industry as a whole and for us in particular. In addition, the nature of the contract\nmanufacturing industry is such that the start-up of new customers and new programs to replace expiring programs occurs\nfrequently, and new customers and program start-ups generally cause margin dilution early in the life of a program.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will be able to fully replace any lost sales from these risks, which could have an adverse\neffect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur ability to efficiently utilize our manufacturing capacity is highly dependent on our customers’ actions.\nRegardless of whether our agreements with our customers, including our significant customers, have a definite term, our\ncustomers typically do not commit to firm production schedules for more than one quarter. Our customers generally have the\nright to cancel a particular product, subject to contractual provisions governing the final product runs, excess or obsolete\ninventory, recovery of dedicated investments, and end-of-life pricing. Accordingly, our relative ability (or inability) to forecast\ncustomer demand levels can make it difficult to schedule production and maximize the efficient use of our manufacturing\ncapacity and supply chain capabilities.\nMany factors outside of our control impact our customers and their ordering behavior, including global pandemics, recessions\nin end markets, changing technologies and industry standards, commercial acceptance for products, shifting market demand,\nproduct obsolescence, changing sourcing strategies, and our customers’ loss of business. New customer relationships also\npresent risk because we do not have an extensive product or customer relationship history.\nWe cannot assure you that our current or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing service arrangements with us\nor significantly change, reduce, cancel, or delay the amount of services ordered. Such changes, delays and cancellations have\nled to, and may lead in the future to declines in our production, increases in excess or obsolete inventory that we may not be\nable to sell to customers or third parties, and reductions in the efficient use of our manufacturing facilities. In the past, we have\nalso been required to increase staffing and other expenses in order to meet anticipated demand. On occasion, customers have\nrequired rapid increases in production for one or more of their products, which stresses our resources and may have an adverse\neffect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n11\nSupply chain disruptions could increase our inventory costs, interrupt our operations, or prevent us from purchasing\nsufficient materials, parts, and components necessary to meet customer demand at competitive prices, in a timely manner, or\nat all.\nWe depend on suppliers globally to provide timely delivery of materials, parts, and components for use in our products. We\nhave experienced, and may again experience in the future, shortages of some of the materials, parts and components that we\nuse, particularly with semiconductors. These shortages can result from strong demand for those components or from problems\nexperienced by suppliers, such as shortages of raw materials and shipping delays for such components with common carriers.\nThese unanticipated component shortages have and, when they occur, may continue to result in curtailed production or delays\nin production, which prevent us from making scheduled shipments to customers.\nOur integrated supply chain solutions for purchasing components and materials is a competitive strength and key to our strategy\nas a CMO. Inflation and prices from suppliers have increased and may continue to rise. When prices rise for these or other\nsimilar reasons, they impact our margins and results of operations if we are not able to pass the increases through to our\ncustomers or otherwise offset them through cost savings. Many of our customer contracts permit periodic prospective\nadjustments to pricing based on decreases and increases in component prices and other factors; however, we could bear the risk\nof component price increases that occur between any such re-pricing or, if such re-pricing is not permitted or accepted by\ncustomers, during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract. There can be no assurance that we will continue to\nbe able to purchase the components and materials needed to manufacture customer products at favorable prices. Accordingly,\ncertain component price increases could adversely affect our gross profit margins and results of operations.\nWe have also experienced, and may again experience in the future, such shortages due to the effects of and responses to\nindustry-wide conditions, pandemics, natural disasters, and other events outside our control, including macroeconomic events,\ntrade restrictions, political crises, social unrest, terrorism, and conflicts (including the Russian invasion of, and ongoing war in,\nUkraine). We cannot reasonably predict the full extent to which these events may impact our supply chain, because any impacts\nwill depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and continuously evolving, including new information that may\nemerge concerning new or existing pandemics, further actions by governmental entities or others in response to the types of\nevents described above, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.\nSuppliers adjust their capacity as demand fluctuates, and component shortages and/or component allocations could occur in\naddition to longer lead times. Certain components we purchase are primarily manufactured in select regions of the world and\nissues in those regions could cause manufacturing delays. Maintaining strong relationships with key suppliers of components\ncritical to the manufacturing process is essential. Our production of a customer’s product has and could again be negatively\nimpacted by any quality, reliability or availability issues with any of our component suppliers. Component shortages may also\nincrease our cost of goods sold because we may be required to pay higher prices for components in short supply and redesign or\nreconfigure products to accommodate substitute components. These and other price increases, including increased tariffs, could\nhave an adverse impact on our profitability if we cannot offset such increases with other cost reductions or by price increases to\ncustomers. If a component shortage is threatened or anticipated, we have and may in the future purchase such components in\ngreater quantities and over longer lead times to avoid a delay or interruption in our operations. Purchasing additional\ncomponents in this way may cause us to incur additional inventory carrying costs and may cause us to experience inventory\nobsolescence, both of which may not be recoverable from our customers and could adversely affect our gross profit margins\nand results of operations. If suppliers fail to meet commitments to us in terms of price, delivery, or quality, or if the supply\nchain is unable to react timely to increases in demand, it could interrupt our operations and negatively impact our ability to meet\ncommitments to customers.\nThe substantial investments required to start up and expand facilities and new customer programs may adversely affect our\nmargins and profitability.\nWe continue to expand our global operations by increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure at\ncertain facilities to support our business. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain\non our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control\nand reporting functions. We may not be able to manage these expansions effectively, which could damage our reputation, limit\nour growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\nStart-ups of new customer programs require the coordination of the design and manufacturing processes, as well as substantial\ninvestments in resources and equipment. The design and engineering required for certain new programs can take an extended\nperiod of time, and further time may be required to achieve customer acceptance. Accordingly, the launch of any particular\nprogram may be delayed, less successful than we originally anticipated, or not successful at all. Additionally, even after\nacceptance, most of our customers do not commit to long-term production schedules, and we are unable to forecast the level of\ncustomer orders with certainty over a given period of time. If our customers do not purchase anticipated levels of products, we\n12\nmay not recover our up-front investments, may not realize profits, and may not effectively utilize expanded fixed manufacturing\ncapacities. All of these types of manufacturing inefficiencies could have an adverse impact on our financial position, operating\nmargins, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur international operations make us vulnerable to financial and operational risks associated with doing business in\nforeign countries.\nWe derive a substantial majority of our revenues from our operations outside the United States, primarily in China, Mexico,\nPoland, Romania, and Thailand. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, which may include the following:\n• global, regional, or local economic and political instability;\n• widespread health emergencies and foreign governments’ measures taken in response to them;\n• foreign currency fluctuations including currency controls and inflation, which may adversely affect our ability to do\nbusiness in certain markets and reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits, or cash flows we generate in non-U.S.\nmarkets;\n• warfare, riots, terrorism, general strikes, or other forms of violence and/or geopolitical disruption;\n• compliance with laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, applicable to operations\noutside of the U.S.;\n• changes in U.S. or foreign policies, regulatory requirements, and laws;\n• tariffs and other trade barriers, including tariffs imposed by the United States as well as responsive tariffs imposed by\nChina, the European Union, or Mexico;\n• potentially adverse tax consequences, including changes in tax rates and the manner in which multinational companies\nare taxed in the United States and other countries; and\n• foreign labor practices.\nThese risks could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Certain foreign\njurisdictions restrict the amount of cash that can be transferred to the United States or impose taxes and penalties on such\ntransfers of cash. To the extent we have excess cash in foreign locations that could be used in, or is needed by, our operations in\nthe United States, we may incur significant penalties and/or taxes to repatriate these funds.\nFor example, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing war there has impacted the global economy as the United States,\nthe UK, the EU, and other countries have imposed broad export controls and financial and economic sanctions against Russia (a\nlarge exporter of commodities), Belarus, and specific areas of Ukraine, and may continue to impose additional sanctions or\nother measures. Russia may impose its own counteractive measures. Companies worldwide have interrupted or stopped\nproduction in Ukraine, Russia, and neighboring countries. We do not procure materials directly from Ukraine or Russia or have\nfacilities there, but impacts like these, wherever they may occur, can further exacerbate the ongoing supply chain disruptions\nthat are occurring across the globe, particularly in the automotive industry. Our European operations are located in Poland and\nRomania, and both of these countries are part of NATO, which is actively taking, and could take in the future, certain measures\nin response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nThe extent of the war’s effect on the global economy and the duration, scope, and impacts of the conflict are unknown and\nhighly unpredictable, and the consequences from future actions such as increased sanctions and retaliatory measures taken by\nthe United States, NATO, or other countries cannot be predicted but could have an adverse impact on our business operations,\nparticularly our European operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and may not be able to compete successfully.\nNumerous manufacturers within the contract manufacturing industry compete globally for business from existing and potential\ncustomers. Some of our competitors have greater resources and more geographically diversified international operations than\nwe do. We also face competition from the manufacturing operations of our customers, who are continually evaluating the merits\nof manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing to contract manufacturing service providers. In the\npast, some of our customers have decided to in-source a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to utilize their excess\ninternal manufacturing capacity. The competition may further intensify as more companies enter the markets in which we\noperate, as existing competitors expand capacity, and as the industry consolidates.\nIn relation to customer pricing pressures, if we cannot achieve the proportionate reductions in costs, profit margins may suffer.\nThe high level of competition in the industry impacts our ability to implement price increases or, in some cases, even maintain\nprices, which also could lower profit margins. In addition, as end markets dictate, we are continually assessing excess capacity\nand developing plans to better utilize manufacturing operations, including consolidating and shifting manufacturing capacity to\nlower cost venues as necessary.\n13\nIf our engineering and manufacturing services do not meet our customers’ quality standards, our sales, operating results,\nand reputation could suffer.\nWe make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive, company-wide quality\nsystems, certifications, and controls in our operations in an effort to ensure sustained compliance with various product and\nquality system regulations and requirements, and to meet the needs of our customers. However, in the event we fail to adhere to\nthese requirements, we become subject to costs associated with product defects, interruptions in production, and reputational\nharm. Our failure to comply with applicable quality system standards could, in turn, adversely affect our customers through\nfailures to supply product to them. Quality or noncompliance failures could have an adverse effect on our reputation in addition\nto an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. While we maintain product liability and\nother insurance coverage that we believe to be generally in accordance with industry practices, our insurance coverage may not\nbe adequate to protect us fully against substantial claims and costs that may arise from warranty and other liabilities related to\nproduct defects.\nOur business may be harmed due to failure to successfully implement information technology solutions or a lack of\nreasonable safeguards to maintain data security, including adherence to data privacy laws and physical security measures.\nThe operation of our business depends on effective information technology systems, including data management, analytics, and\nemerging machine learning and artificial intelligence platforms and applications. These systems are subject to the risk of\nsecurity breach or cybersecurity threat, including misappropriation of assets or other sensitive information, such as confidential\nbusiness information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers, and other business partners, or data\ncorruption which could cause operational disruption. The unpredictability of AI, machine learning, and similar systems that\nautomate certain operational tasks bring the potential for unintended consequences and unexpected disruptions in business\noperations, financial losses, and reputational damage. As we could be the target of cyber and other security threats, which are\nbecoming increasingly sophisticated, we must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and\ninfrastructure to prevent, detect, address, and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, and other\nevents that could have a security impact. Information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to\nresearch new technologies and processes, maintain and enhance existing systems, and develop new systems in order to keep\npace with changes in information processing technology and evolving industry standards as well as to protect against cyber\nrisks and security breaches. While we provide employee awareness training around phishing, malware, and other cyber threats\nto help protect against these cyber and security risks, we cannot ensure the measures we take to protect our information\ntechnology systems will be sufficient.\nImplementation delays, poor execution, or a breach of information technology systems could disrupt our operations, damage\nour reputation, or increase costs related to the mitigation of, response to, or litigation arising from any such issue. Similar risks\nexist with our third-party vendors. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruption in\ncommunications services, cyber attacks, or security breaches, have the potential to hinder our ability to conduct business. In\naddition, data privacy laws and regulations, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the UK\nGDPR, ePrivacy Directive, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), and similar legislation in jurisdictions in which we\noperate, pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate costs, and any failure to comply with these\nlaws and regulations could result in significant penalties.\nWe depend on attracting and retaining executive officers, key employees, skilled personnel, and sufficient labor to efficiently\noperate our business.\nOur success depends to a large extent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and diverse executive officers, key\nemployees, and skilled personnel, and to continue to implement our succession plans for managers and other key employees.\nThese employees are not generally bound by employment or non-competition agreements, and we cannot assure you that we\nwill retain them. The labor market for these employees is intensely competitive, and compensation and benefit costs continue to\nincrease significantly in the current economic environment. In particular, the high demand for manufacturing labor in certain\ngeographic areas in which we operate makes recruiting new production employees and retaining experienced production\nemployees difficult.\nOur success also depends on keeping pace with technological advancements, including Industry 4.0, and adapting services to\nprovide manufacturing capabilities which meet customers’ changing needs. Therefore, we must retain our qualified engineering\nand technical personnel and successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes in a cost effective and timely manner.\nShortages of workers could adversely impact our ability to operate our business effectively and timely serve our customers’\nneeds, which could adversely affect our relations with customers, result in reductions in orders from customers, or cause us to\nlose customers. Turnover in personnel could result in additional training and inefficiencies that could adversely impact our\noperating results. Our culture and guiding principles focus on continuous training, motivating, and development of employees,\n14\nand we strive to attract, motivate, and retain qualified personnel. To aid in managing our growth and strengthening our pool of\nqualified personnel, we will need to internally develop, recruit, and retain diverse, qualified personnel. If we are not able to do\nso, our business and our ability to continue to grow could be harmed.\nRegulatory and Litigation Risks\nFailure to protect our intellectual property could undermine our competitive position.\nCompeting effectively depends, to a significant extent, on maintaining the proprietary nature of our intellectual property. We\nattempt to protect our intellectual property rights worldwide through a combination of keeping our proprietary information\nsecret and utilizing trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party non-disclosure\nand assignment agreements. Because of the differences in foreign laws concerning proprietary rights, our intellectual property\nrights do not generally receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they do in the United States, and therefore,\nin some parts of the world, we have limited protections, if any, for our intellectual property. If we are unable to adequately\nprotect our intellectual property embodied in our solutions, designs, processes, and products, the competitive advantages of our\nproprietary technology could be reduced or eliminated, which would harm our business and could have a material adverse\neffect on our results of operations and financial position.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Indiana law could delay or prevent a change in control.\nCertain provisions of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and the Amended and Restated By-Laws may delay\nor prevent a merger or acquisition that a Share Owner may consider favorable. For example, the Amended and Restated Articles\nof Incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock, prevents Share Owners from\nacting by written consent without unanimous consent, and requires a supermajority Share Owner approval for certain business\ncombinations with related persons. These provisions may discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in\ncontrol, which could harm our stock price. Indiana law also imposes some restrictions on potential acquirers.\nOur failure to maintain applicable registrations for our manufacturing facilities could negatively impact our ability to\nproduce products for our customers.\nWe make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive, company-wide quality\nsystems, certifications, and controls in our operations in an effort to ensure sustained compliance with various product and\nquality system regulations and requirements, and to meet the needs of our customers. However, in the event we fail to adhere to\nthese requirements, we become subject to potential investigations and fines and penalties. Our failure to comply with applicable\nregulations and quality system standards could, in turn, adversely affect our customers through failures to supply product to\nthem or delays in their ability to obtain and maintain product approvals. As a medical device manufacturer, we also have\nadditional compliance requirements. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) extensively regulates all aspects of\nproduct and manufacturing quality for medical products under its current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) regulations.\nOutside the U.S., our operations and our customers’ products are subject to similar regulatory requirements, notably by the\nEuropean Medicines Agency and the Safe Food and Drug Administration in China. For instance, we are required to register\nwith the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation\n(“QSR”) requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing,\nquality control and documentation procedures. Any determination by the FDA or other regulatory authorities of manufacturing\nor other deficiencies could adversely affect our business. Failure or noncompliance could have an adverse effect on our\nreputation in addition to an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nClimate change, and the legal and regulatory initiatives related to climate change, could subject us to extensive\nenvironmental regulation and significant potential environmental liabilities.\nThere is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon\ndioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and\nan increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters or extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, earthquakes,\ndroughts, wildfires, cyclones, or floods. Physical climate risks and the operation of facilities in areas subject to increased water\nstress could impair our production capabilities, disrupt the operations of our supply chain and infrastructure, and impact our\ncustomers and their demand for our services.\nThe past and present operation and ownership by Kimball Electronics of manufacturing plants and real property are subject to\nextensive and changing federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to\ndischarges in air, water, and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, the use of certain hazardous materials\nin the production of select products, and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances.\n15\nIn addition, as regulators and investors increasingly focus on climate change and other sustainability issues, we are subject to\nnew disclosure frameworks and regulations. For example, the European Parliament adopted the Corporate Sustainability\nReporting Directive (CSRD) and the resulting adoption of EU sustainability reporting standards to be developed by the\nEuropean Financial Reporting Advisory Group, with such standards to be tailored to EU policies building on and contributing\nto international standardization initiatives, will apply not only to local operations in the EU, but under certain circumstances, to\nentire global companies like Kimball Electronics that have EU operations. The CSRD will not apply to our operations in\ncalendar year 2024, but we are assessing our obligations under the CSRD and we expect that compliance with the CSRD could\nrequire significant effort in future years. The SEC and the State of California have also proposed new climate change disclosure\nrequirements, and compliance with such rules, if and when they are finalized, could also require significant effort.\nWe cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or\nregulations will be administered or interpreted, or what environmental conditions may be found to exist. Compliance with more\nstringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretation of existing laws, may require additional expenditures, some of which\ncould be material. In addition, any investigations or remedial efforts relating to environmental matters could involve material\ncosts or otherwise result in material liabilities.\nThe long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and our industry in particular are unclear. Changes in climate\nwhere we, our customers, and our supply chain operate could have a long-term adverse impact on our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition. In addition, we have committed to cut our greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, electrical\nusage, and air emissions significantly by 2025 as part of our long-term sustainability strategy, and we may take additional\nvoluntary steps to mitigate our impact on the environment. Climate transition risks related to shifts to a low-carbon economy\nand the associated costs of retrofitting or constructing facilities with green technology, in addition to investments in renewable\nenergy and energy efficiency could involve material costs or otherwise impact our customers and their demand for our services.\nEnvironmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand, or available sources of energy, water, or other resources may\naffect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. The cost of\nenergy is a critical component of freight expense and the cost of operating manufacturing facilities. Increases in the cost of\nenergy in particular could reduce our profitability. Given the political significance and uncertainty around these issues, we\ncannot predict how climate change, and the legal and regulatory initiatives related to climate change, will affect our operations\nand financial condition.\nCompliance with government legislation and regulations may significantly increase our operating costs in the United States\nand abroad.\nLegislation and regulations promulgated by the U.S. federal and foreign governments could significantly impact our\nprofitability by burdening us with forced cost choices that either cannot be recovered by increased pricing or, if we increase our\npricing, could negatively impact demand for our products. For example:\n• Changes in policies by the U.S. or other governments could negatively affect our operating results due to changes in\nduties, tariffs or taxes, or limitations on currency or fund transfers, as well as government-imposed restrictions on\nproducing certain products in, or shipping them to, specific countries. For example, our facility in Mexico operates\nunder the Mexican Maquiladora (“IMMEX”) program. This program provides for reduced tariffs and eased import\nregulations. We could be adversely affected by changes in the IMMEX program or our failure to comply with its\nrequirements. As another example, the U.S. government has imposed tariffs on certain products imported from China.\nChina has imposed tariffs on certain U.S. products in retaliation. These tariffs could force our customers or us to\nconsider various strategic options including, but not limited to, looking for different suppliers, shifting production to\nfacilities in different geographic regions, absorbing the additional costs, or passing the cost on to customers.\nUltimately, these tariffs could adversely affect the competitiveness of our domestic operations, which could lead to the\nreduction or exit of certain U.S. manufacturing capacity. Depending on the types of changes made, demand for our\nforeign manufacturing facilities could be reduced, or operating costs in our manufacturing facilities could be increased,\nwhich could negatively impact our financial performance. Moreover, any retaliatory actions by other countries where\nwe operate could also negatively impact our financial performance.\n• The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and\naccountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as “conflict minerals,” originating from the\nDemocratic Republic of Congo (“DRC”) and adjoining countries. These rules could adversely affect the sourcing,\nsupply, and pricing of materials used in our products, as the number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals\nmay be limited. We may also suffer reputational harm if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not\ndetermined to be conflict-free or if we are unable to modify our products to avoid the use of such materials. We may\nalso face challenges in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as containing conflict-free\nminerals or that we adopt more stringent guidelines like those fostered by the Responsible Materials Initiative\n(“RMI”).\n16\n• We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety, product stewardship\nand producer responsibility laws and regulations, including those arising from global pandemics or relating to the use,\ngeneration, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process, those\ngoverning worker health and safety, those requiring design changes, supply chain investigation or conformity\nassessments, and those relating to the recycling or reuse of products we manufacture. These include EU regulations\nand directives, such as the Restrictions on Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”), the Waste Electrical and Electronic\nEquipment (“WEEE”) directives, and the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals\n(“REACH”) regulation, and similar regulations in China (the Management Methods for Controlling Pollution for\nElectronic Information Products or “China RoHS”). In addition, new technical classifications of e-Waste being\ndiscussed in the Basel Convention technical working group could affect both our customers’ abilities and obligations\nin electronics repair and refurbishment. If we fail to comply with any present or future regulations or timely obtain any\nneeded permits, we could become subject to liabilities, and we could face fines or penalties, the suspension of\nproduction, or prohibitions on sales of products we manufacture. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability\nto expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment, or to incur other significant expenses,\nincluding expenses associated with the recall of any non-compliant product or with changes in our operational,\nprocurement and inventory management activities.\nSustainability/ESG issues, including those related to climate change and sustainability, may increase our costs and impose\ndifficult and expensive compliance requirements.\nCustomers, consumers, investors, and other stakeholders, particularly in the EMS industry, are increasingly focusing on\nenvironmental issues, including climate change, water use, deforestation, waste, and other sustainability concerns. Along with\nour stakeholders and our broader industry, we have increased our focus on sustainability and measurement of our progress\nagainst sustainability criteria, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to achieve relevant criteria with our current focus.\nOur ability to successfully execute relevant initiatives and accurately report our progress presents numerous operational,\nfinancial, legal, reputational and other risks, many of which are outside our control, and all of which could have a material\nnegative impact on our business.\nNew disclosures, along with the evolving global regulatory landscape, may present increased compliance costs and regulatory\nor enforcement risks, as well as increased competition from market participants who may adopt more robust sustainability/ESG\nreporting and sustainable business practices. If our sustainability initiatives fail to satisfy investors, current or potential\ncustomers, consumers, and our other stakeholders, our reputation, our ability to sell products and services to customers, our\nability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment or business partner could be negatively impacted.\nSimilarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our goals, targets, and objectives, or to satisfy various reporting\nstandards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could also have similar negative impacts and expose us to government\nenforcement actions and private litigation.\nIn addition, our customers have adopted, and may continue to adopt, procurement policies that require us to comply with\ngovernance, social, and environmental responsibility provisions. Our customers have also adopted, and may continue to adopt,\ngoals and policies that serve to increase their demand for goods or services that do not produce significant greenhouse gas\nemissions and are not related to carbon-based energy sources. Furthermore, an increasing number of investors have adopted,\nand may continue to adopt, ESG policies for their portfolio companies, and various voluntarily sustainability initiatives and\norganizations have promulgated different social and environmental responsibility and sustainability guidelines. These practices,\npolicies, provisions, and initiatives are under active development, subject to change, can be unpredictable and conflicting, and\nmay prove difficult and expensive for us to comply with and could negatively affect our reputation, business, or financial\ncondition.\nFinancial Risks\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our customers.\nThe instability of market conditions drives an elevated risk of potential bankruptcy of customers resulting in a greater risk of\nuncollectible outstanding accounts receivable. Accordingly, we intensely monitor our receivables and related credit risks. The\nrealization of these risks could have a negative impact on our profitability.\nFailure to effectively manage working capital may adversely affect our cash flow from operations.\nWe closely monitor inventory and receivable efficiencies and continuously strive to improve these measures of working capital,\nbut customer financial difficulties, cancellation or delay of customer orders, shifts in customer payment practices, transfers of\nproduction among our manufacturing facilities, additional inventory purchases to mitigate potential impact from component\nshortages, or manufacturing delays could adversely affect our cash flow from operations.\n17\nWe could incur losses due to asset impairment.\nAs business conditions change, we must continually evaluate and work toward the optimum asset base. It is possible that certain\nassets such as, but not limited to, facilities, equipment, intangible assets, or goodwill could be impaired at some point in the\nfuture depending on changing business conditions. Such impairment could have an adverse impact on our financial position and\nresults of operations.\nFluctuations in our effective tax rate could have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash\nflows.\nOur effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic mix of earnings across the jurisdictions where we operate.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rates in those jurisdictions could have a material impact on our operating results. Judgment is\nrequired in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes, other tax liabilities, interest, and penalties. We base our tax\nposition upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various\ncountries in which we have assets or conduct activities. Our tax position, however, is subject to review and possible challenge\nby taxing authorities and to possible changes in law (including adverse changes to the manner in which the United States and\nother countries tax multinational companies or interpret their tax laws). We cannot determine in advance the extent to which\nsome jurisdictions may assess additional tax or interest and penalties on such additional taxes. In addition, our effective tax rate\nmay be increased by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in our cash management strategies,\nchanges in local tax rates, or countries adopting more aggressive interpretations of tax laws.\nSeveral countries where we operate provide tax incentives to attract and retain business. We have obtained incentives where\navailable and practicable. Our taxes could increase if certain incentives were retracted, they were not renewed upon expiration,\nwe no longer qualify for such programs, or tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions were otherwise increased. In addition,\nour growth may cause our effective tax rate to increase, depending on the jurisdictions in which we expand our business or\nacquire operations. Given the scope of our international operations and our international tax arrangements, changes in tax rates\nand the manner in which multinational companies are taxed in the United States and other countries could have a material\nimpact on our financial results and competitiveness.\nCertain of our subsidiaries provide financing, products, and services to, and may undertake certain significant transactions with,\nother subsidiaries in different jurisdictions. Moreover, several jurisdictions in which we operate have tax laws with detailed\ntransfer pricing rules which require that all transactions with non-resident related parties be priced using arm’s length pricing\nprinciples and that contemporaneous documentation must exist to support such pricing. Due to inconsistencies among\njurisdictions in the application of the arm’s length standard, our transfer pricing methods may be challenged and, if not upheld,\ncould increase our income tax expense. In addition, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development continues to\nissue guidelines and proposals related to transfer pricing and profit shifting that may result in legislative changes that could\nreshape international tax rules in numerous countries and negatively impact our effective tax rate.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk.\nIn 2022, the relative value of the U.S. dollar reached its highest levels since 2000 and has appreciated sharply against many\nforeign currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates could impact our operating results. Our risk management strategy includes\nthe use of derivative financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures. Any hedging techniques we implement\ncontain risks and may not be entirely effective. Exchange rate fluctuations could also make our products more expensive than\ncompetitors’ products not subject to these fluctuations, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability in\ninternational markets.\nA failure to comply with the financial covenants under our credit facilities could adversely impact us.\nOur primary credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants. We believe the most significant covenants\nunder our credit facilities are the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness minus unencumbered U.S. cash on hand in the United\nStates in excess of $15 million to adjusted consolidated EBITDA, as defined in our primary credit facility, and the interest\ncoverage ratio. More detail on these financial covenants is discussed in Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations. As of June 30, 2024, we had $294.8 million in borrowings under our credit\nfacilities and had total cash and cash equivalents of $78.0 million. In the future, a default on the financial covenants under our\ncredit facilities could cause an increase in the borrowing rates or make it more difficult for us to secure future financing, which\ncould adversely affect our financial condition.\n18\nWe are exposed to inflation, interest rate, and other banking and capital market risks.\nHigh levels of inflation in the U.S. and other countries where we operate have and may continue to increase our costs and may\nimpact pricing and customer demand, both of which may impact our revenues and earnings. We have exposure to interest rate\nrisk on our borrowings under our credit facilities. The interest rates of these borrowings are based on a spread plus applicable\nbase rate, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”), the\nprime rate of a reference bank, or the federal funds rate. An adverse change in the base rates upon which our interest rates are\ndetermined could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Rising interest\nrates have increased our costs of borrowing. Additionally, volatility in capital markets could present challenges to us if we need\nto raise funds in the equity market. This, in turn, may cause us to adopt strategies that may be less capital-intensive. Volatility in\nthe credit markets, including due to the recent bank failures as well as the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank’s actions and pace of\ninterest rate increases to combat inflation in the U.S., may have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe will face risks associated with the organic and inorganic growth of our business and we may neither be able to continue\nthat growth nor have the necessary resources to dedicate to that growth.\nWe plan to expand our business to new customers, new commercial applications, and new commercial markets, including those\nwhere we may have limited operating experience, through organic growth and acquisitions. Accordingly, we may be subject to\nincreased business, technology, and economic risks that could materially affect our business. In recent periods, we have\nincreased our focus on organic growth and customer acquisition. In the future, we may increasingly focus on this organic\ngrowth, and we may identify inorganic growth opportunities through acquisitions and customer divestitures. Expanding in the\nverticals in which we are already operating will continue to require significant resources and there is no guarantee that such\nefforts will be successful or beneficial to us. Historically, sales to new customers have often led to additional sales to the same\ncustomers or similarly situated customers. As we expand into and within new and emerging markets for our services, we will\nlikely face additional regulatory scrutiny, risks, and business challenges from our customers, governments, and other\nstakeholders in those markets. While this approach to growth within new and existing commercial markets and verticals has\nproven successful in the past, it is uncertain we will achieve the same penetration and organic growth or identify suitable\ninorganic growth opportunities in the future and our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nnegatively impacted.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or policies have affected, and in the future may affect, our reported financial\ncondition or results of operations.\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC, and various\nbodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. A change in these policies can have a significant effect on\nour reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions that are completed before a change is announced. Changes to\nthose rules or questions as to how we interpret or implement them may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial\nresults or on the way we conduct business. See Note 1 - Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nof Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the adoption of the new accounting guidance.\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and have a negative impact on our reputation.\nWe are or may become party to various claims and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. These claims and\nlegal proceedings may include lawsuits or claims relating to contracts, intellectual property, product recalls, product liability,\nemployment matters, environmental matters, regulatory compliance, or other aspects of our business. Even when not merited,\nthe defense of these claims and legal proceedings may divert our management’s attention, and we may incur significant\nexpenses in defending these claims and proceedings. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or\nbecome subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position,\ncash flows, or results of operations. The outcome of litigation is often difficult to predict, and the outcome of pending or future\nclaims and legal proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.\nWe evaluate these claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible,\nthe amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves or disclose the relevant\nlitigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to\nmanagement at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ\nmaterially from our current assessments and estimates. If actual outcomes or losses differ materially from our current\nassessments and estimates or additional claims or legal proceedings are initiated, we could be exposed to significant liabilities.\n19\nNatural disasters, pandemics, or other catastrophic events may impact our production schedules and, in turn, negatively\nimpact profitability.\nNatural disasters, pandemics, or other catastrophic events, including severe weather (including cyclones, hurricanes, and floods)\nas well as terrorist attacks, power interruptions, fires, and pandemics, could disrupt operations and likewise our ability to\nproduce or deliver products. Our manufacturing operations require significant amounts of energy, including natural gas and oil,\nand governmental regulations may control the allocation of such fuels to Kimball Electronics. Employees are an integral part of\nour business, and events such as a pandemic could reduce the availability of employees reporting for work. In the event we\nexperience a temporary or permanent interruption in our ability to produce or deliver product, revenues could be reduced, and\nbusiness could be materially adversely affected. In addition, catastrophic events, or the threat thereof, can adversely affect U.S.\nand world economies, and could result in reduced demand for our customers’ products and delayed or lost revenue for our\nservices. Further, any disruption in our IT systems could adversely affect the ability to receive and process customer orders,\nmanufacture products, and ship products on a timely basis, and could adversely affect relations with customers, potentially\nresulting in reduction in orders from customers or loss of customers. We maintain insurance to help protect us from costs\nrelating to some of these matters, but it may not be sufficient or paid in a timely manner to us in the event of such an\ninterruption.\nItem 1B - Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C - Cybersecurity\nWe depend on information systems and technology in substantially all aspects of our business, including communications\namong our employees and with suppliers and customers. We recognize the significance of developing, implementing, and\nmaintaining cybersecurity measures to safeguard our information systems and products and protect the confidentiality, integrity,\nand availability of our data.\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nWe have designed our cybersecurity risk management program and strategy to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and\navailability of our critical information technology systems and information. Our program is integrated into, and among the risks\nevaluated and considered by, our broader enterprise risk management program, through which we identify, assess, prioritize,\nand mitigate risks across the Company to support the achievement of our strategic objectives.\nManaging Material Risks & Integrated Overall Risk Management\nCybersecurity is a critical part of our enterprise risk management. To address cybersecurity threats, we leverage a multi-layer\napproach, with our Audit Committee providing oversight and direction and our Chief Information Officer (“CIO”) leading a\nteam that is responsible for forming our enterprise-wide information security strategy, training, policy, standards, architecture\nand processes to protect us against cybersecurity risks. Our program includes protocols for preventing, detecting, and\nresponding to cybersecurity incidents, and cross-functional coordination and governance of business continuity and disaster\nrecovery plans. Components of our program include:\n• a continuous, four-phase Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process of risk program development, risk assessment\nand prioritization, risk response, and risk validation and monitoring designed to help identify cybersecurity threats to\nour critical IT systems, information, and our broader enterprise IT environment;\n• the periodic engagement of independent security firms and other third-party experts, where appropriate, to assess, test,\nand certify components of our cybersecurity program, such as penetration (pen) testing, and to otherwise assist with\naspects of our cybersecurity processes and controls;\n• focused, annual, and mandatory risk management education for our employees and leaders, including cybersecurity\nawareness training, multiple cybersecurity and phishing awareness campaigns throughout each year, and tabletop\nexercises;\n• regular assessments of the design and operational effectiveness of the program’s key processes and controls by\nmanagement, our internal audit team, and third-party experts; and\n• a risk management process for third-party service providers and vendors not under our direct control that includes pre-\nselection due diligence and validation, and post-selection periodic monitoring to manage cybersecurity risks and\nmonitor adherence to applicable cybersecurity standards.\nWe utilize ISO 27001 to identify, assess and manage information security risk and maintain a compliant Information Security\nManagement System (“ISMS”). Our global information security management program is ISO 27001:2013 certified.\n20\nThird Party Engagements for Risk Management\nWe engage a range of external experts, including cybersecurity consultants and auditors to support, evaluate and test our\ncybersecurity risk management systems. We engage a managed security service provider (“MSSP”) that provides continuous\nthreat intelligence by monitoring our network and connected devices to detect attacks and indicators of potential attacks.\nOur collaboration with other third parties includes regular audits of our ISO 27001 compliance, penetration testing, threat\nassessments, and consultation on security enhancements. These partnerships provide expert knowledge and insights which are\ndesigned to ensure our cybersecurity strategies and processes are appropriate.\nGovernance\nThe Board’s Role\nThe Board is responsible for overseeing overall risk management for the Company, including annual or more frequent review\nand approval of the Enterprise Risk Management approach and processes implemented by management to identify, assess,\nmanage and mitigate risk. The Board has delegated certain responsibilities for oversight of the Company’s cybersecurity and\ninformation security framework, data protection, cybersecurity, and risk management to the Audit Committee of the Board. Our\nBoard recognizes that cybersecurity protection is vital to maintaining our operations, and the trust of our business and supply\nchain partners, and of our Share Owners.\nAt each of their respective meetings, the Board and/or Audit Committee receive, and provide feedback on, reports on relevant\ndata protection and cybersecurity matters. Additionally, two regular Board meetings each year and each Audit Committee\nmeeting include additional, in-depth technology and cybersecurity briefings from senior members of our information\ntechnology department, internal audit function, and legal department. The topics covered by these reports and briefings include\nrisk management strategies, data protection, ongoing risk mitigation activities, cybersecurity strategy, governance structure, and\nthe results of security breach simulations.\nManagement’s Role\nOur cybersecurity risk management program is led by our Chief Information Officer (“CIO”), who reports to our CEO and\nmanages our security team principally responsible for managing our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, our security\ncontrols, and our detection and response to cybersecurity incidents. The CIO meets regularly with the CEO and his direct\nreports to discuss cybersecurity risk and ensure appropriate resources are prioritized to address risks. We continue to secure our\nown manufacturing and information technology infrastructure; to train our employees throughout each year about malware,\nviruses, hacking, phishing, and other information security risks, including how to avoid and mitigate them; and to protect our\nsensitive data from failures, breaches, or cyber incidents. We periodically (more than annually) perform tabletop exercises to\ntest our incident response procedures, identify gaps and improvement opportunities and exercise team preparedness.\nThe Company’s Chief Information Officer has formal education in information technology and extensive experience over 20\nyears working in and leading information systems and technology functions. Our Chief Information Officer receives regular\nupdates on cybersecurity matters, results of mitigation efforts, and cybersecurity incident response and remediation.\nThe Company’s team responsible for developing and executing our cybersecurity policies together with our CIO, including our\nDirector of Cybersecurity and Director of IT Infrastructure and Operations, are individuals with formal education and degrees\nin information technology or cybersecurity, experience working in information technology and cybersecurity, including\nrelevant industry experience in security related industries, or a combination of both education and experience. Additionally,\nleaders in the Company’s information technology function receive periodic training and education on cybersecurity-related\ntopics. The CIO is responsible for providing quarterly updates to the Board's Audit Committee regarding the effectiveness of\nthe Company's cybersecurity program and any material cybersecurity incidents that may arise.\nThe Company’s Kimball Electronics Support Center (“KESC”) serves as the central point for all cybersecurity incidents and\nreporting, including incidents that directly target employees or our information systems and incidents originating from third\nparties. The KESC monitors, detects, alerts and responds to cybersecurity incidents, evaluating each incident pursuant to our\nCybersecurity Incident Response Plan. The KESC escalates incidents with significant impact and pervasiveness to the\nCompany’s Cybersecurity Incident Response Team (“CIRT”) for further action. Depending on the nature of the attack or\nindicator, our MSSP will collaborate with us in response to incidents to contain, mitigate, respond to, investigate and eliminate\nthreats. Where appropriate, the CIRT will escalate incidents to the Audit Committee and the Board for additional consideration,\naction, and potential disclosure.\nThe KESC, our cybersecurity leaders, and/or our CIRT evaluate each incident, as appropriate, in terms of its impact on our\noperations, our ability to conduct business with customers and suppliers, our brand reputation and health, safety, and the speed\nand degree to which the incident has been contained. These teams are also responsible for activating containment and resolution\nefforts and interfacing with third-party service providers like our MSSP where appropriate to support the Company through the\nresolution of the incident. After initial identification, the KESC monitors all cybersecurity incidents for changes in degree of\nimpact or pervasiveness and communicates with our leaders, including the CIO and CIRT about the same.\n21\nRisks from Cybersecurity Threats\nAs part of our overall risk mitigation strategy, we maintain insurance coverage for certain aspects of cybersecurity risks;\nhowever, such insurance may not be sufficient either in type or amount to cover us against claims related to cybersecurity\nbreaches, cyberattacks, and other related breaches.\nAs of the date of this report, we do not believe that any risks from cybersecurity threats, including those resulting from any\nprevious cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our Company, including\nour business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. Despite our security measures, however, there can be no\nassurance that we, or third parties with which we interact, will not experience a cybersecurity incident in the future that will\nmaterially affect us. For more information on our cybersecurity related risks, see Item 1A - Risk Factors - “Our business may\nbe harmed due to failure to successfully implement information technology solutions or a lack of reasonable safeguards to\nmaintain data security, including adherence to data privacy laws and physical security measures.”\nItem 2 - Properties\nWe have nine manufacturing facilities with two located in Indiana, one in China, two in Mexico, and one located in each of\nFlorida, Poland, Romania, and Thailand. These facilities occupy approximately 1,649,000 square feet in aggregate,\nsubstantially all of which are owned. In addition, we own a 42,000 square-foot building to house our headquarters located in\nJasper, Indiana.\nGenerally, our manufacturing facilities are utilized at normal capacity levels on a multiple shift basis. At times, certain facilities\nutilize reduced shifts due to demand and sales fluctuations. We continually assess our capacity needs and evaluate our\noperations to optimize our service levels by geographic region. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for information regarding financial\nand operational risks related to our international operations.\nSignificant loss of income resulting from a facility catastrophe would be partially offset by business interruption insurance\ncoverage.\nWe hold a land lease for our facility in China that expires in fiscal year 2056 and one for our facility in Thailand that expires in\nfiscal year 2030. See Note 1 - Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for additional information concerning leases. In addition, we own approximately 109 acres of land which\nincludes land where our facilities reside.\nItem 3 - Legal Proceedings\nWe and our subsidiaries are not parties to any pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation and claims\nincidental to the business. The outcome of current routine pending litigation and claims, individually and in the aggregate, is not\nexpected to have a material adverse impact on our business or financial condition.\nItem 4 - Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\n22\nInformation about Our Executive Officers\nOur executive officers as of August 23, 2024 are as follows:\n(Age as of August 23, 2024)\nName Age Office and Area of Responsibility\nRichard D.

Additional cautionary\nstatements regarding other risk factors that could have an effect on the future performance of Kimball Electronics are located\nwithin Item 1A - Risk Factors.\nBusiness Overview\nWe are a global, multifaceted manufacturing solutions provider. We provide electronics manufacturing services (“EMS”),\nincluding engineering and supply chain support, to customers in the automotive, medical, and industrial end markets. Our core\ncompetency is producing durable electronics, and we further offer contract manufacturing services for non-electronic\ncomponents, medical disposables, drug delivery solutions, and precision molded plastics. Our manufacturing services, including\nengineering and supply chain support, utilize common production and support capabilities globally. We are well recognized by\nour customers and the industry for our excellent quality, reliability, and innovative service. CIRCUITS ASSEMBLY, a leading\nbrand and technical publication for electronics manufacturers worldwide, has previously recognized us four times for achieving\nthe Highest Overall Customer Rating in their Service Excellence Awards, and most recently, we received Highest Overall\nCustomer Ratings in four of the seven categories in 2023.\nThe contract manufacturing services industry is very competitive. As a mid-sized player, we can expect to be challenged by the\nagility and flexibility of the smaller, regional players, and we can expect to be challenged by the scale and price\ncompetitiveness of the larger, global players. We enjoy a unique market position between these extremes which allows us to\ncompete with the larger scale players for high-volume projects, but also maintain our competitive position in the generally\nlower volume durable electronics market space. We expect to continue to effectively operate in this market space; however, one\nsignificant challenge will be maintaining our profit margins while we continue our revenue growth. Pricing is competitive in the\nmarket as production efficiencies and material pricing advantages for most projects drive costs and prices down over the life of\nthe projects. This characteristic of the contract electronics marketplace is expected to continue.\nThe Worldwide Manufacturing Services Market - 2024 Edition, a comprehensive study on the worldwide EMS market\npublished by New Venture Research (“NVR”), provided worldwide forecast trends through 2028. NVR projects the worldwide\nassembly market for electronics products to grow at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 4.6% over the next five\nyears, with the EMS industry projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.6%.\nWe continue to monitor the current economic and industry conditions for uncertainties that may pose a threat to our future\ngrowth or cause disruption in business strategy, execution, and timing in the markets in which we compete.\nThe EMS industry is experiencing the impacts of softening demand from global macroeconomic headwinds, especially in the\ncurrent fiscal year. The financial impact on our future results cannot be reasonably estimated but could be material. Such\nheadwinds include pressure from elevated levels of inflation, higher interest rates, and geopolitical uncertainty.\nNet sales in fiscal year 2024 decreased 6% from the prior fiscal year, with decreases in each of our end market verticals. The\ndecrease in sales to customers in the automotive market were largely driven by decreased demand. In the medical market, sales\ndecreased due to decreased sales with a large medical customer, first impacting our results in late fiscal year 2023, who is\nremediating a recall. The cause of the recall is unrelated to the products we provided. In the industrial market, sales decreased in\nlarge part due to a program at our automation, test, and measurement business in fiscal year 2023 not recurring this fiscal year.\nWe expect consolidated net sales to decrease again in 2025 with the continued softness in demand and the loss of a major\nautomotive program by our customer that was unrelated to any issues with our workmanship, quality, or ability to produce the\nproduct, in addition to the expected consolidated net sales decrease from the divestiture of our GES business discussed further\nin this section.\nWe have a strong focus on cost control balanced with managing the future growth prospects of our business. We expect to make\ninvestments that will strengthen or add new capabilities to our package of value as a multifaceted manufacturing solutions\ncompany, including through our recently completed capacity expansions. Managing working capital in conjunction with\nfluctuating demand levels is likewise key. In addition, a long-standing component of our profit-sharing incentive bonus plan is\nits link to our financial performance, which results in varying amounts of compensation expense as profits change.\n26\nTo support our renewed strategic focus, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we made the decision to divest of GES, our\nautomation, test and measurement business unit, and committed to a plan to sell the business. This will allow us to increase\nfocus and support our EMS operations. As a result, the disposal group has met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and is\nreported at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell at June 30, 2024. We completed the divestiture of our\nGES business on July 31, 2024. In addition to the decision to divest of GES, we undertook restructuring efforts to align our cost\nstructure with reduced end-market demand levels.\nWe continue to maintain a strong balance sheet as of the end of fiscal year 2024, which included a current ratio of 2.3, a debt-\nto-equity ratio of 0.5, and Share Owners’ equity of $540 million. Recently, we have invested to support our expansions and\ngrowth in Mexico, Thailand, and Poland. We expect our balance sheet to continue to normalize as we negotiate with customers\non excess inventory and as certain component shortages subside. Refer to the Future Liquidity section of Liquidity and Capital\nResources below for further discussion of our liquidity.\nThe continuing success of our business is dependent upon our ability to replace expiring customers/programs with new\ncustomers/programs. We monitor our success in this area by tracking the number of customers and the percentage of our net\nsales generated from them by years of service as depicted in the table below. While variation in the size of program awards\nmakes it difficult to directly correlate this data to our sales trends, we believe it does provide useful information regarding our\ncustomer loyalty and new business growth.\nYear End\nCustomer Service Years 2024 2023 2022\nMore than 10 Years\n% of Net Sales . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 76% 77% 79%\n# of Customers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38 31 34\n5 to 10 Years\n% of Net Sales . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18% 19% 17%\n# of Customers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 22 21\nLess than 5 Years\n% of Net Sales . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6% 4% 4%\n# of Customers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 12 11\nTotal\n% of Net Sales . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100% 100% 100%\n# of Customers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 65 65 66\nA detailed discussion of risk factors and uncertainties that could have an effect on our performance are located within Item 1A -\nRisk Factors.\n27\nPresentation of Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is\npresented below.

The impact from foreign currency\nfluctuations on net sales was negligible in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023. Beginning in fiscal year 2024, we\nchanged our presentation of revenue for miscellaneous sales previously included in Other to include in the respective\ncustomers’ end market verticals. Prior year periods have been recast to conform to the current year presentation. By end market\nvertical, our market verticals fluctuated as follows:\n• Sales to customers in the automotive market were down slightly in the current fiscal year when compared to the prior\nfiscal year due to the overall decrease in demand across most of our major customers.\n• Sales to customers in the medical market decreased when compared to the prior fiscal year. This decrease is primarily\ndue to decreased sales with a large medical customer who is remediating a recall. The cause of the recall is unrelated to\nthe products we provided. Partially offsetting this decrease in sales was a ramp-up of certain programs and new\nproduct launches.\n• Sales to customers in the industrial market were down slightly in the current fiscal year when compared to the prior\nfiscal year. The decrease is largely due to lower demand with our climate control customers as well as a program at our\nautomation, test, and measurement business from fiscal year 2023 not recurring this year.\n28\nSales to Nexteer Automotive, Philips, and ZF accounted for the following portions of our net sales:\nYear Ended June 30\n2024 2023\nNexteer Automotive . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16% 15%\nPhilips . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . * 14%\nZF . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13% 12%\n* amount is less than 10% of total\nGross profit as a percent of net sales declined in fiscal year 2024 when compared to fiscal year 2023 as we experienced lost\nabsorption on lower revenue.\nFor fiscal year 2024, selling and administrative expenses remained relatively flat as a percent of net sales but decreased in\nabsolute dollars when compared to fiscal year 2023. The absolute dollar decrease was driven by decreased profit-sharing bonus\nexpense and supplier financing charges due to decreased sales.\nOther General Income in fiscal years 2024 and 2023 consisted of $0.9 million and $0.2 million, respectively, resulting from\npayments received related to class action lawsuits in which Kimball Electronics was a class member. These lawsuits alleged\nthat certain suppliers to the EMS industry conspired over a number of years to raise and fix the prices of electronic components,\nresulting in overcharges to purchasers of those components.\nFor fiscal year 2024, we recorded pre-tax restructuring expense of $2.4 million, for employee-related costs as we undertook\nrestructuring efforts to align our cost structure with reduced end market demand levels.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we made the decision to divest our automation, test and measurement business unit and\ncommitted to a plan to sell the business. As a result, the disposal group has met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and\nwe have reported the business unit at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. The carrying value exceeded\nthe fair value less costs to sell, and we recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $5.8 million and $17.0 million on goodwill and\nassets held for sale, respectively, in fiscal year 2024. See Note 3 - Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale of Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nOther Income (Expense) consisted of the following:\nOther Income (Expense) Year Ended\nJune 30\n(Amounts in Thousands) 2024 2023\nInterest Income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 638 $ 153\nInterest Expense . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The loss in fiscal year 2024 and the gain in fiscal year 2023 were driven\nby the respective weakening and strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies that we have exposure to in our\nbusiness. The revaluation of the fair value of the supplemental employee retirement plan (“SERP”) investments recorded in\nOther Income (Expense) is offset by the revaluation of the SERP liability recorded in Selling and Administrative Expenses, and\nthus there is no effect on net income.\n29\nOur income before income taxes and effective tax rate were comprised of the following U.S. and foreign components:\nYear Ended June 30, 2024 Year Ended June 30, 2023\nIncome (Loss) Effective Tax Income Before Effective Tax\n(Amounts in Thousands) Before Taxes Rate Taxes Rate\nUnited States . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ (35,055) 21.6% $ (6,269) (1.1) %\nForeign . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 60,254 20.3% $ 81,013 23.2%\nTotal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 25,199 18.6% $ 74,744 25.3%\nThe consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 was lower due to the impact of the GES impairment charges, partially\noffset by the valuation allowance. The domestic unfavorable tax rate was also distorted by the impairment charges.\nThe consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 was unfavorably impacted by the mix of taxable earnings within our\nvarious tax jurisdictions and foreign exchange rate movements. The domestic favorable tax rate was favorably impacted by our\nloss before taxes and the research and development tax credit.\nOur overall effective tax rate will fluctuate depending on the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings. See Note 11 -\nIncome Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nWe recorded net income of $20.5 million in fiscal year 2024, or $0.81 per diluted share, a decrease of 63.3% from fiscal year\n2023 net income of $55.8 million, or $2.22 per diluted share.\nOpen orders were down 11% as of June 30, 2024 compared to June 30, 2023. The decrease in open orders from June 30, 2023\nis primarily driven by reduced orders from a large medical customer who is remediating a recall. Open orders are the aggregate\nsales price of production pursuant to unfulfilled customer orders, which may be delayed or canceled by the customer subject to\ncontractual termination provisions. The majority of open orders as of June 30, 2024 are expected to be filled within the next\ntwelve months. Open orders at a point in time may not be indicative of future sales trends due to the contract nature of our\nbusiness and the variability of order lead times among our customers.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking capital at June 30, 2024 was $471.7 million compared to working capital of $454.3 million at June 30, 2023. The\ncurrent ratio was 2.3 at June 30, 2024 and 2.0 at June 30, 2023, respectively. The debt-to-equity ratio was 0.5 at both June 30,\n2024 and June 30, 2023. Our short-term liquidity available, represented as cash and cash equivalents plus the unused amount of\nour credit facilities, some of which are uncommitted, totaled $220.1 million at June 30, 2024 and $149.1 million at June 30,\n2023.\nCash Conversion Days (“CCD”) are calculated as the sum of Days Sales Outstanding (“DSO”) plus Contract Asset Days\n(“CAD”) plus Production Days Supply on Hand (“PDSOH”) less Accounts Payable Days (“APD”) and less Advances from\nCustomers Days (“ACD”). CCD, or a similar metric, is used in our industry and by our management to measure the efficiency\nof managing working capital. The following table summarizes our CCD for the quarterly periods indicated.\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30, March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30,\n2024 2024 2023 2023 2023\nDSO . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 58 59 64 58 56\nCAD . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16 17 18 17 14\nPDSOH . . . . . . . . . . . . 93 103 109 108 97\nAPD . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50 58 65 71 65\nACD . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17 11 9 9 8\nCCD . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100 110 117 103 94\nWe define Days Sales Outstanding as the average of monthly trade accounts and notes receivable divided by an average day’s\nnet sales, Contract Asset Days as the average monthly contract assets divided by an average day’s net sales, Production Days\nSupply on Hand as the average of monthly gross inventory divided by an average day’s cost of sales, Accounts Payable Days as\nthe average of monthly accounts payable divided by an average day’s cost of sales, and Advances from Customers Days as the\nthe average of monthly customer deposits divided by an average day’s cost of sales. Over the past several quarters, we have\nsupported our customers through strategic inventory builds to mitigate parts shortages, which adversely impacted our PDSOH\nand CCD metrics. Additionally, in fiscal year 2024, we have experienced customers push out deliveries due to softening\n30\nconsumer demand. As lead times dictate the ordering of components, these push outs negatively impact our cash conversion\ndays and working capital. In these situations, we negotiate with our customers for inventory deposits or consignment\narrangements to limit the impact to our balance sheet. We expect inventory levels and working capital to continue to normalize\nas we seek relief through customer negotiations.\nCash Flows\nThe following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\nYear Ended June 30\n(Amounts in Millions) 2024 2023\nNet cash provided by (used for) operating activities . . . . . . . $ 73.2 $ (13.8)\nNet cash used for investing activities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ (46.5) $ (90.5)\nNet cash provided by financing activities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 9.0 $ 99.2\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 was driven by net income adjusted for non-\ncash items, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used for operating activities for the fiscal year\nended June 30, 2023 was driven by changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by net income adjusted for non-\ncash items. Net income and non-cash adjustments provided cash of $82.6 million, while changes in operating assets and\nliabilities used $9.4 million of cash in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, cash used by\nchanges in operating assets and liabilities was $107.3 million, while net income and non-cash adjustments provided cash of\n$93.5 million.\nNet income adjusted for non-cash items provided cash of $82.6 million in fiscal year 2024. Partially offsetting this was cash\nused of $9.4 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities in fiscal year 2024, largely due to the decrease in accounts\npayable which used cash of $102.6 million driven by decreased inventory purchases due to lower sales. Partially offsetting cash\nused by accounts payable was a decrease in inventory which provided cash of $64.2 million driven by decreased inventory\npurchases due to lower sales, and an increase in advances from customers, which provided cash of $34.9 million.\nThe cash used of $107.3 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities in fiscal year 2023 was largely due to an\nincrease in accounts receivable, which used cash of $82.4 million primarily resulting from increased sales volumes, and an\nincrease in inventory, which used cash of $50.2 million, driven by investment to support our expansions. Partially offsetting\ncash used by inventory was an increase in accounts payable, which provided cash of $20.4 million largely resulting from\nincreased inventory purchases, and an increase in advances from customers, which provided cash of $7.9 million.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2024 includes $47.0 million cash used for capital investments. The\ncapital investments were primarily to support new business awards, replacement of older machinery and equipment, and facility\nexpansions.\nNet cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2023 includes $90.7 million cash used for capital investments. The\ncapital investments were primarily for expansions at our Mexico, Thailand, and Poland facilities and to support new business\nawards.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 resulted largely from net borrowings on our\ncredit facilities of $13.5 million primarily for working capital purposes and capital expenditures.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 resulted largely from net borrowings on our\ncredit facilities of $100.7 million primarily for working capital purposes and capital investments supporting expansions.\n31\nCredit Facilities\nThe Company maintains a U.S. primary credit facility (the “primary credit facility”) scheduled to mature on May 4, 2027. The\nprimary credit facility provides for $300 million in borrowings, with an option to increase the amount available for borrowing\nto $450 million at the Company’s request, subject to the consent of each lender participating in such increase. The Company\nalso maintains a 364-day multi-currency revolving credit facility (the “secondary credit facility”), which allows for borrowings\nup to $100 million and has a maturity date of January 3, 2025. The proceeds of the loans on the primary credit facility and the\nsecondary credit facility are to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company. We were in\ncompliance with the financial covenants of the primary and secondary credit facilities during the fiscal year ended June 30,\n2024. As noted in the Future Liquidity section below, we amended our secondary credit facility on January 5, 2024 to increase\nthe borrowings to $100 million.\nWe also maintain foreign credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes at specific foreign locations rather\nthan utilizing funding from intercompany sources. These foreign credit facilities can be canceled at any time by either the bank\nor us and generally include renewal clauses. As of June 30, 2024, we maintained foreign credit facilities at our Thailand\noperation, our EMS operation in China, our Netherlands subsidiary, our Poland operation, and our Vietnam operation.\nSee Note 8 - Credit Facilities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our credit facilities,\nincluding the terms of the credit facilities such as interest, commitment fees, and debt covenants.\nFactoring Arrangements\nWe participate in our customers’ supply chain financing arrangements in order to extend terms for the customer without\nnegatively impacting our cash flow. These arrangements in all cases do not contain recourse provisions which would obligate\nus in the event of our customers’ failure to pay. Receivables are considered sold when they are transferred beyond the reach of\nKimball Electronics and its creditors, the purchaser has the right to pledge or exchange the receivables, and we have\nsurrendered control over the transferred receivables. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we sold, without\nrecourse, $410.0 million and $485.4 million of accounts receivable, respectively. See Note 1 - Business Description and\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the\nfactoring arrangements.\nFuture Liquidity\nWe believe our principal sources of liquidity from available funds on hand, cash generated from operations, proceeds from the\nsale of GES, and the availability of borrowing under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other\noperating needs for at least the next 12 months. The unused borrowings in USD equivalent under all of our credit facilities\ntotaled $142.1 million at June 30, 2024, including the 100 million secondary credit facility. We amended our secondary credit\nfacility on January 5, 2024 to increase the borrowing limit to $100 million from $50 million and change the maturity date to\nJanuary 3, 2025. The increased borrowing limit will provide us with more liquidity at the enterprise level to meet working\ncapital and other operating needs. Additionally, accounts receivable factoring arrangements could provide flexible access to\ncash as needed. While our primary credit facility includes a covenant that limits the amount of sold receivables outstanding at\nany time, currently and historically, we have been considerably below this limit.\nWe expect to continue to prudently invest in capital expenditures, including for capacity expansions and potential acquisitions,\nthat would help us continue our growth as a multifaceted manufacturing solutions company. We recently completed our\nThailand facility expansion in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, our Mexico facility expansion in the first quarter of fiscal\nyear 2023, and our Poland expansion in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023.\nAt June 30, 2024, our capital expenditure commitments were approximately $14 million, consisting primarily of capital related\nto new program wins and replacement of older machinery and equipment. We anticipate our available liquidity will be\nsufficient to fund these capital expenditures.\nWe have purchase obligations that arise in the normal course of business for items such as raw materials, services, and software\nacquisitions/license commitments. In certain instances, such as when lead times dictate, we enter into contractual agreements\nfor material in excess of the levels required to fulfill customer orders. In turn, material authorization agreements with customers\ncover a portion of the exposure for material that we must purchase prior to having a firm order.\nAt June 30, 2024, our foreign operations held cash totaling $77.9 million. The Company continually evaluates its global cash\nneeds. The aggregate unremitted earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, which are currently permanently reinvested,\nwere approximately $482 million as of June 30, 2024. If such funds were repatriated or we determined that all or a portion of\nsuch foreign earnings are no longer permanently reinvested, we may be subject to applicable non-U.S. income and withholding\ntaxes. Determination of the amount of any potential future unrecognized deferred tax liability on such unremitted earnings is not\npracticable and is recorded in the period that the funds are repatriated.\n32\nThe Company’s Repurchase Plan allows the repurchase of up to $100 million of our common stock. Purchases may be made\nunder various programs, including in open-market transactions, block transactions on or off an exchange, or in privately\nnegotiated transactions, all in accordance with applicable securities laws and regulations. The Repurchase Plan has no\nexpiration date but may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The extent to which the Company repurchases its shares, and\nthe timing of such repurchases, will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements, and\nother corporate considerations, as determined by the Company’s management team. The Company expects to finance the\npurchases with existing liquidity. The Company has repurchased $91.8 million of common stock under the Repurchase Plan\nthrough June 30, 2024.\nOur ability to generate cash from operations to meet our liquidity obligations could be adversely affected in the future by\nfactors such as general economic and market conditions, lack of availability of raw material components in the supply chain, a\ndecline in demand for our services, loss of key contract customers, unsuccessful integration of acquisitions and new operations,\nglobal health emergencies, and the related uncertainties around the financial impact, and other unforeseen circumstances. In\nparticular, should demand for our customers’ products and, in turn, our services decrease significantly over the next 12 months,\nthe available cash provided by operations could be adversely impacted.\nFair Value\nDuring fiscal year 2024, no level 1 or level 2 financial instruments were affected by a lack of market liquidity. For level 1\nfinancial assets, readily available market pricing was used to value the financial instruments. Our foreign currency derivative\nassets and liabilities, which were classified as level 2, were independently valued using observable market inputs such as\nforward interest rate yield curves, current spot rates, and time value calculations. To verify the reasonableness of the\nindependently determined fair values, these derivative fair values were compared to fair values calculated by the counterparty\nbanks. Our own credit risk and counterparty credit risk had an immaterial impact on the valuation of the foreign currency\nderivatives. See Note 13 - Fair Value of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of June 30, 2024, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nKimball Electronics’ Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America. These principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts\nreported and disclosed in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. Actual results could differ from these\nestimates and assumptions. Management uses its best judgment in the assumptions used to value these estimates, which are\nbased on current facts and circumstances, prior experience, and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable.\nManagement believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in\npreparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements and are the policies that are most critical in the portrayal of our financial\nposition and results of operations. Management has discussed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit\nCommittee of the Company’s Board of Directors and with the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm.\nRevenue recognition - Kimball Electronics recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an\namount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services and products.\nThe majority of our revenue is recognized over time as manufacturing services are performed where we manufacture a product\nwith no alternative use and have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. The remaining revenue is\nrecognized when the customer obtains control of the manufactured product. We have elected to account for shipping and\nhandling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill our promise to transfer the associated products.\nAccordingly, we record customer payments of shipping and handling costs as a component of net sales and classify such costs\nas a component of cost of sales. We recognize sales net of applicable sales or value add taxes. Based on estimated product\nreturns and price concessions, a reserve for returns and allowances is recorded at the time revenue is recognized, resulting in a\nreduction of revenue.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets - Goodwill, $6.2 million and $12.0 million as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,\nrepresents the difference between the purchase price and the related underlying tangible and intangible net asset fair values\nresulting from business acquisitions. Annually, or if conditions indicate an earlier review is necessary, goodwill is tested at the\nreporting unit level. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, goodwill is written down to\nits estimated fair value. Our decision to divest GES, our former automation, test and measurement business, and the disposal\ngroup meeting the criteria to be classified as held for sale, resulted in goodwill impairment of $5.8 million, pre-tax in fiscal year\n2024. No impairment charges were recorded in fiscal year 2024 or 2023 resulting from our annual impairment tests for all other\nreporting units.\n33\nOther Intangible Assets, $3.0 million and $12.3 million as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are reported on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets and consist of capitalized software, customer relationships, technology, and trade name. Intangible\nassets are reviewed for impairment, and their remaining useful lives evaluated for revision, when events or circumstances\nindicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the assets. Our decision to divest of our\nautomation, test and measurement business resulted in the associated intangible assets being classified as held for sale.\nSee Note 1 - Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 - Assets and Liabilities Held for\nSale of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s goodwill and intangible asset\naccounting policies, held for sale classification, and impairment.\nTaxes - Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to\ntemporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax\nbases. These assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in\nwhich the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter\nby assessing the likelihood of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize\nour deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we provide a valuation allowance based on our best estimate of future taxable\nincome in the various taxing jurisdictions and the amount of deferred taxes ultimately realizable. Future events could change\nmanagement’s assessment.\nWe operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve\ncomplex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. However, we believe we have made adequate\nprovision for income and other taxes for all years that are subject to audit. As tax positions are effectively settled, the tax\nprovision will be adjusted accordingly. The liability for uncertain income tax and other tax positions, including accrued interest\nand penalties on those positions, was $1.6 million and $1.8 million at June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively.\nNumerous foreign jurisdictions in which the company operates have adopted the Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment’s global framework implementing a 15% corporate minimum tax, commonly referred to as Pillar Two. The\nCompany will be subject to Pillar Two beginning in fiscal year 2025. Based on current legislation and available guidance, we\ndo not anticipate Pillar Two will have a material impact to our financial condition, results of operation, cash flows, or effective\ntax rate. We will continue to monitor additional guidance as it is released.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 - Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements for information regarding New Accounting Standards.\nItem 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk: Kimball Electronics operates internationally and thus is subject to potentially adverse movements\nin foreign currency rate changes. Our principal foreign currency exposures include the Euro, Polish zloty, Romanian leu,\nChinese renminbi, Thai baht, and Mexican peso. In fiscal year 2024, our principal foreign currency exposures also included the\nVietnamese dong. Our risk management strategy includes the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge certain foreign\ncurrency exposures. Derivatives are used only to manage underlying exposures and are not used in a speculative manner.\nFurther information on derivative financial instruments is provided in Note 14 - Derivative Instruments of Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements. We estimate that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates\nfrom levels at June 30, 2024 relative to non-functional currency balances of monetary instruments, to the extent not hedged by\nderivative instruments, would not have a material impact on profitability in an annual period. Actual future gains and losses\ncould have a material impact in an annual period depending on changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships,\nhedging instruments, timing, and other factors.\nInterest Rate Risk: Our primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our primary credit facility,\ndescribed further in Note 8 - Credit Facilities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as the interest rates paid for\nborrowings are determined at the time of borrowing based on market indices. Therefore, although we can elect to fix the interest\nrate at the time of borrowing, the facility does expose us to market risk for changes in interest rates. We estimate that a\nhypothetical 10% change in interest rates on borrowing levels at June 30, 2024 would not have a material impact of profitability\nin an annual period. The interest rate on certain borrowings under our credit facilities, including our primary credit facility, are\nbased on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”).\n34\nItem 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPage No.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 36\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB No. 34) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2024 and 2023 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40\nConsolidated Statements of Income for Each of the Three Years in the Period Ended June 30, 2024 . . . . . . . . . . . . . 41\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for Each of the Three Years in the Period Ended June 30, 2024 42\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for Each of the Three Years in the Period Ended June 30, 2024 . . . . . . . . . 43\nConsolidated Statements of Share Owners’ Equity for Each of the Three Years in the Period Ended June 30, 2024 . 44\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 45\n35\nMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of Kimball Electronics, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over\nfinancial reporting and for the preparation and integrity of the accompanying financial statements and other related information\nin this report. The consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the footnotes, were\nprepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include judgments\nand estimates, which in the opinion of management are applied on an appropriately conservative basis. We maintain a system\nof internal and disclosure controls intended to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded from loss or material\nmisuse, transactions are authorized and recorded properly, and that the accounting records may be relied upon for the\npreparation of the financial statements. This system is tested and evaluated regularly for adherence and effectiveness by\nemployees who work within the internal control processes and by our staff of internal auditors.\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is comprised of directors who are not employees of the Company, meets\nregularly with management, our internal auditors, and the independent registered public accounting firm to review our financial\npolicies and procedures, our internal control structure, the objectivity of our financial reporting, and the independence of the\nindependent registered public accounting firm. The internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm\nhave free and direct access to the Audit Committee, and they meet periodically, without management present, to discuss\nappropriate matters.\nBecause of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements\nand even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement\npreparation and presentation.\nThese consolidated financial statements are subject to an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting conducted under\nthe supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\nBased on that evaluation, conducted under the criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued\nby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, management concluded that our internal control\nover financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2024.\n/s/ RICHARD D. PHILLIPS\nRichard D. Phillips\nChief Executive Officer\nAugust 23, 2024\n/s/ JANA T. CROOM\nJana T. Croom\nChief Financial Officer\nAugust 23, 2024\n36\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Share Owners and the Board of Directors of Kimball Electronics, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Kimball Electronics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”)\nas of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, share owners’ equity, and\ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2024, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the\nIndex at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). We have also audited the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the\nCompany as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended June 30, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also,\nin our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June\n30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the\naccompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthese financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We\nare a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and\nare required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the\noverall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included\nperforming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n37\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that\nwas communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that\nare material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and\nwe are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition - Contracts Recognized Over Time - Refer to Notes 1 and 2 to the Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe majority of the Company’s revenue is recognized over time as manufacturing services are performed when the Company\nmanufactures a product to customer specifications with no alternative use and for which the Company has an enforceable right\nto payment for performance completed to date. The Company generally recognizes revenue over time to depict the Company’s\nprogress towards meeting its performance obligations, using costs based input methods, in which judgment is required to\nevaluate assumptions including the anticipated margins to estimate the corresponding amount of revenue to recognize.\nThe timing differences of revenue recognition, billings to the Company’s customers, and cash collections from the Company’s\ncustomers result in billed accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable. Contract assets on the consolidated balance\nsheets relate to unbilled accounts receivable and occur when revenue is recognized over time as manufacturing services are\nprovided and the billing to the customer has not yet occurred as of the balance sheet date, which are generally transferred to\nreceivables in the next fiscal quarter due to the short-term nature of the manufacturing cycle.\nWe identified the Company’s revenue recognition over time for contracts with customers as a critical audit matter because of\nthe judgments required to evaluate assumptions including the anticipated margins to estimate the corresponding amount of\nrevenue to recognize and contract assets to record. This required an increased extent of audit effort due to the significant\nnumber of contracts on which the Company recognizes revenue over time, and a high degree of auditor judgment when\nperforming procedures to audit management’s estimate of anticipated margins used to recognize revenue over time and\nevaluating the results of those procedures.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to management’s estimates of the anticipated margins used to recognize revenue over time and\nrecord contract assets included the following, among others:\n• We tested the effectiveness of controls over the Company’s recognition of revenue over time and the related contract\nasset balance, including management’s process for estimating the anticipated margins for products manufactured to\ncustomer specifications for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to\ndate.\n• We evaluated management’s ability to estimate revenue accurately by comparing actual margins to management’s\nhistorical estimates for completed contracts.\n• We selected a sample of contracts with customers and performed the following:\n◦ Evaluated whether the contracts with customers were properly included or excluded in management’s\ncalculation of over time contract revenue based on the terms and conditions of each contract, including\nwhether the Company determined the product has no alternative use and that the Company has an enforceable\nright to payment for performance completed to date.\n◦ Compared the transaction prices to the consideration expected to be received based on current rights and\nobligations under the contracts and any modifications that were agreed upon with the customers.\n◦ Tested the accuracy and completeness of the costs incurred to date for the respective performance obligations\nby comparing the quantities on hand and standard cost per the calculation to the Company’s perpetual\ninventory information and testing any manufacturing variances and purchase price adjustments.\n◦ Evaluated the calculation of the amount of revenue to recognize for the performance obligation by:\n38\n▪ Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s anticipated margins used in the Company’s\ncalculation of revenue.\n▪ Evaluating the appropriateness and consistency of the methods and assumptions used by\nmanagement to develop the estimates of anticipated margin at completion.\n• We tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculation of revenue recognized over time and the related\ncontract asset balance.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nIndianapolis, Indiana\nAugust 23, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2014.\n39\nKIMBALL ELECTRONICS,

(also referred to herein as “Kimball Electronics,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a global,\nmultifaceted manufacturing solutions provider. We provide electronics manufacturing services (“EMS”), including engineering\nand supply chain support, to customers in the automotive, medical, and industrial end markets. We deliver a package of value\nthat begins with our core competency of producing durable electronics, and we further offer contract manufacturing services for\nnon-electronic components, medical disposables, precision molded plastics, and production automation, test, and inspection\nequipment. Our design and manufacturing expertise coupled with robust processes and procedures help us ensure that we\ndeliver the highest levels of quality, reliability, and service throughout the entire life cycle of our customers’ products. We\ndeliver award-winning service across our highly integrated global footprint, which is enabled by our largely common operating\nsystem, procedures, and standardization. We are well recognized by customers and industry trade publications for our excellent\nquality, reliability, and innovative service.\nSubsequent to June 30, 2024, on July 31, 2024, we completed the divestiture of GES, our automation, test and measurement\nbusiness unit. See Note 3 - Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale for more information on the GES divestiture.\nPrinciples of Consolidation:\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of all domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All significant\nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidation.\nUse of Estimates:\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts included in\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements and related note disclosures. While efforts are made to assure estimates used are\nreasonably accurate based on management’s knowledge of current events, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSegment Information:\nKimball Electronics has business units located in the United States, China, Mexico, Poland, Romania, and Thailand, and each\nof these business units qualify as operating segments. In addition, GES has operations located in the United States, China, India,\nJapan, and Vietnam. The GES operations qualify as a single operating segment with its group results regularly reviewed by our\nchief operating decision maker, which is our Chief Executive Officer.\nOur operating segments meet the aggregation criteria under the current accounting guidance for segment reporting. As of\nJune 30, 2024, all of our operating segments provide contract manufacturing services, including engineering and supply chain\nsupport, for the production of electronic assemblies and other products including medical devices, medical disposables,\nprecision molded plastics, and automation, test, and inspection equipment primarily in automotive, medical, and industrial\napplications, to the specifications and designs of our customers. The nature of the products, the production process, the type of\ncustomers, and the methods used to distribute the products have similar characteristics across all our operating segments. Each\nof our operating segments service customers in multiple markets, and many of our customers’ programs are manufactured and\nserviced by multiple operating segments. We leverage global processes such as component procurement and customer pricing\nthat provide commonality and consistency among the various regions in which we operate. All of our operating segments have\nsimilar long-term economic characteristics, and as such, have been aggregated into one reportable segment.\nRevenue Recognition:\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with the standard issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”),\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers and all the related amendments. Our revenue from contracts with customers is\ngenerated primarily from manufacturing services provided for the production of electronic assemblies, components, medical\ndevices, medical disposables, precision molded plastics, and automation, test, and inspection equipment built to customers’\nspecifications. Our customer agreements are generally not for a definitive term but continue for the relevant product’s life cycle.\nTypically, our customer agreements do not commit the customer to purchase our services until a purchase order is provided,\nwhich is generally short term in nature. Customer purchase orders primarily have a single performance obligation. Generally,\nthe prices stated in the customer purchase orders are agreed upon prices for the manufactured product and do not vary over the\n45\nterm of the order, and therefore, the majority of our contracts do not contain variable consideration. In limited circumstances,\nwe may enter into a contract which contains minimum quantity thresholds to cover our capital costs, and we may offer our\ncustomer a rebate for specific volume thresholds or other incentives; in these cases, the rebates or incentives are accounted for\nas variable consideration.\nThe majority of our revenue is recognized over time as manufacturing services are performed as we manufacture a product to\ncustomer specifications with no alternative use and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.\nThe remaining revenue for manufacturing services is recognized when the customer obtains control of the product, typically\neither upon shipment or delivery of the product dependent on the terms of the contract, and the customer is able to direct the use\nof and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the asset. We generally recognize revenue over time using costs\nbased input methods, in which judgment is required to evaluate assumptions including anticipated margins to estimate the\ncorresponding amount of revenue to recognize. Costs used as a basis for estimating anticipated margins include material, direct\nand indirect labor, and appropriate applied overheads. Anticipated margins are determined based on historical or quoted\ncustomer pricing. Costs based input methods are considered a faithful depiction of our efforts and progress toward satisfying\nour performance obligations for manufacturing services and for which we believe we are entitled to payment for performance\ncompleted to date. The cumulative effect of revisions to estimates related to net contract revenues or costs are recorded in the\nperiod in which the revisions to estimates are identified and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.\nWe have elected to account for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill our\npromise to transfer the associated services and products. Accordingly, we record customer payments of shipping and handling\ncosts as a component of net sales and classify such costs as a component of cost of sales. We recognize sales net of applicable\nsales or value add taxes. Based on estimated product returns and price concessions, a reserve for returns and allowances is\nrecorded at the time revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of net revenue.\nDirect incremental costs to obtain and fulfill a contract are capitalized as a contract asset only if they are material, expected to\nbe recovered, and are not accounted for in accordance with other guidance. Incidental items that are immaterial in the context of\nthe contract are recognized as expense in the period incurred.\nCash and Cash Equivalents:\nCash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of\nacquisition. Cash and cash equivalents consist of bank accounts and money market funds. Bank accounts are stated at cost,\nwhich approximates fair value, and money market funds are stated at fair value.\nTrade Accounts Receivable:\nThe Company’s trade accounts receivable are recorded per the terms of the agreement or sale, and accrued interest is\nrecognized when earned. Our policy for estimating the allowance for credit losses on trade accounts receivable includes\nanalysis of such items as aging, credit worthiness, payment history, and historical bad debt experience. Management uses these\nspecific analyses in conjunction with an evaluation of the general economic and market conditions to estimate expected credit\nlosses. Management believes that historical loss information generally provides a basis for its assessment of expected credit\nlosses. Trade accounts receivable are written off after exhaustive collection efforts occur and the receivable is deemed\nuncollectible. Adjustments to the allowance for credit losses are recorded in Selling and Administrative Expenses on our\nConsolidated Statements of Income.\nIn the ordinary course of business, customers periodically negotiate extended payment terms on trade accounts receivable.\nCustomary terms require payment within 30 to 45 days, with any terms beyond 45 days being considered extended payment\nterms. We participate in our customers’ supply chain financing arrangements for certain of our accounts receivables in order to\nextend terms for the customer without negatively impacting our cash flow. These arrangements in all cases do not contain\nrecourse provisions which would obligate us in the event of our customers’ failure to pay. Receivables are considered sold\nwhen they are transferred beyond the reach of Kimball Electronics and its creditors, the purchaser has the right to pledge or\nexchange the receivables, and we have surrendered control over the transferred receivables. During fiscal years 2024, 2023, and\n2022, we sold, without recourse, $410.0 million, $485.4 million, and $303.4 million of accounts receivable, respectively.\nFactoring fees were $3.4 million, $4.8 million, and $1.6 million during fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and\nwere included in Selling and Administrative Expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, changes to the expected timing of payments from and risk of default for a customer resulted in the\nrecording of an allowance for credit losses of $2.0 million in Selling and Administrative Expenses on our Consolidated\nStatements of Income. Although the customer is not in bankruptcy and we will continue to pursue full recovery, an allowance\nwas deemed necessary in consideration of the expected timing of payments and risk of default. The amount expected to be\ncollected after twelve months is included in Other Assets, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At June 30, 2024, the\nnoncurrent receivable associated with this customer in Other Assets, net totaled $2.5 million, which is net of the $2.0 million\nallowance for expected credit losses. The current portion of receivables from this customer is $3.4 million at June 30, 2024.\n46\nInventories:\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes material, labor, and applicable manufacturing\noverhead. Costs associated with underutilization of capacity are expensed as incurred. Inventories are valued using the first-in,\nfirst-out (“FIFO”) method. Inventories are adjusted for excess and obsolete inventory. Evaluation of excess inventory includes\nsuch factors as anticipated usage, inventory turnover, inventory levels, and product demand levels. Factors considered when\nevaluating obsolescence include the age of on-hand inventory and reduction in value due to damage, design changes, or\ncessation of product lines. Evaluation of both excess inventory and obsolescence also considers whether customer agreements\nspecify customer obligation to pay for such inventory.\nProperty, Equipment, and Depreciation:\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the\nassets using the straight-line method. Generally, maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation and expenses\nfor maintenance and repairs are included in both Cost of Sales and Selling and Administrative Expense on the Consolidated\nStatements of Income.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets:\nWe perform reviews for impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\nvalue of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized when estimated future cash flows expected to result from\nthe use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. When an impairment is identified, the carrying\namount of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value. Assets to be disposed of are recorded at the lower of net book value or\nfair market value less cost to sell at the date management commits to a plan of disposal. In fiscal year 2024, we recognized\n$17.0 million of impairment with the decision to divest of GES. See Note 3 - Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale for more\ninformation on the GES divestiture. Impairment of long-lived assets was not material during fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\nGoodwill:\nGoodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the related underlying tangible and intangible net asset fair\nvalues resulting from business acquisitions. Annually, or if conditions indicate an earlier review is necessary, goodwill is\nassessed or tested at the reporting unit level. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value,\ngoodwill is written down to its estimated fair value.\nTo test for goodwill impairment, we use a combination of the Income Approach and the Market Approach. The discounted cash\nflow method (Income Approach) uses forecasted information based on management’s strategic plans and projections. Discount\nrates are developed using a weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) methodology. The WACC represents the blended\naverage required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk\nfactors. In the Market Approach, fair value is determined using transactional evidence for similar publicly traded equity.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, the Company made the decision to divest of GES, our automation, test and measurement business unit\nand committed to a plan to sell the business. As a result, the business unit met the criteria to be classified as held for sale, and\ngoodwill and asset impairment were recorded during the quarter. See Note 3 - Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale for more\ninformation on goodwill and asset impairment and Note 6 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets of Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements for more information on Goodwill.\nOther Intangible Assets:\nOther Intangible Assets reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist of capitalized software, customer relationships,\ntechnology, and trade name. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment, and their remaining useful lives evaluated for\nrevision, when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the\nassets. Internal-use software is stated at cost less accumulated amortization and is amortized using the straight-line method.\nDuring the software application development stage, capitalized costs include external consulting costs, cost of software\nlicenses, and could include internal payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with a software\nproject. Upgrades and enhancements are capitalized if they result in added functionality which enable the software to perform\ntasks it was previously incapable of performing. Software maintenance, training, data conversion, and business process\nreengineering costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.\n47\nLeases:\nThe Company leases certain office facilities, warehouse facilities and equipment under operating leases, in addition to land on\nwhich certain office and manufacturing facilities reside. These operating leases expire from fiscal year 2025 to 2057. Operating\nlease costs and cash payments for operating leases are immaterial to the Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements\nof Income and our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nResearch and Development:\nThe costs of research and development are expensed as incurred and are included in Cost of Sales on the Consolidated\nStatements of Income. Research and development costs were approximately $18.3 million, $24.4 million, and $23.7 million in\nfiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nInsurance and Self-insurance:\nWe are self-insured up to certain limits for general liability, workers’ compensation, and certain domestic employee health\nbenefits including medical, short-term disability, and dental, with the related liabilities included in the accompanying financial\nstatements. Our policy is to estimate reserves based upon a number of factors including known claims, estimated incurred but\nnot reported claims, and other analyses, which are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future\nevents. Approximately 15% of the workforce is covered under self-insured medical and short-term disability plans. At June 30,\n2024 and 2023, accrued liabilities for self-insurance exposure were $2.2 million and $2.7 million, respectively.\nThe remainder of our workforce not covered by self-insured plans have medical and disability coverage through either our\nexternal plans or government plans. Insurance benefits are not provided to retired employees.\nIncome Taxes:\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities, recorded in Other Assets and Other long-term liabilities, respectively, in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets, are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences\nbetween the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. These assets\nand liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary\ndifferences are expected to reverse. We evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the\nlikelihood of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our deferred tax\nassets. If recovery is not likely, we provide a valuation allowance based on our best estimate of future taxable income in the\nvarious taxing jurisdictions and the amount of deferred taxes ultimately realizable. Future events could change management’s\nassessment.\nWe operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve\ncomplex uncertain tax positions, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. A tax benefit from an uncertain tax\nposition may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing\nauthorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We maintain a liability for uncertain income tax and other tax\npositions, including accrued interest and penalties on those positions. As tax positions are effectively settled, the tax liability is\nadjusted accordingly. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in Provision for Income Taxes on\nthe Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 11 - Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more\ninformation on income taxes.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk:\nWe have business and credit risks associated with our customers. The Company monitors credit quality and associated risks of\nreceivables on an individual basis based on criteria such as financial stability of the party and collection experience in\nconjunction with general economic and market conditions.\nA summary of significant customers’ net sales and trade receivables as a percentage of consolidated net sales and consolidated\ntrade receivables is as follows:\nNet Sales Trade Receivables\nYear Ended June 30 As of June 30\n2024 2023 2022 2024 2023\nNexteer Automotive . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16% 15% 17% 21% 21%\nPhilips . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . * 14% 15% * *\nZF . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13% 12% * 14% 10%\nHL Mando . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . * * * * 12%\n* amount is less than 10% of total\n48\nOff-Balance Sheet Risk:\nOff-balance sheet arrangements are limited to standby letters of credit entered into in the normal course of business as described\nin Note 7 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther General Income:\nOther General Income in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 consisted of $0.9 million, $0.2 million, and $1.4 million,\nrespectively, resulting from payments received related to class action lawsuits in which Kimball Electronics was a class\nmember. These lawsuits alleged that certain suppliers to the EMS industry conspired over a number of years to raise and fix the\nprices of electronic components, resulting in overcharges to purchasers of those components.\nRestructuring:\nWe recorded restructuring expenses of $2.4 million in fiscal year 2024 for employee-related costs as we undertook restructuring\nefforts to align our cost structure with reduced end market demand levels, including resizing our workforce and taking specific\ncost actions. We expect to continue executing the restructuring efforts and estimate between $3.0 million and $4.0 million of\nadditional pre-tax restructuring charges, most of which we expect in the first half of fiscal year 2025. There were no\nrestructuring charges in fiscal year 2023 or fiscal year 2022.\nNon-operating Income and Expense:\nNon-operating income (expense), net includes the impact of such items as foreign currency rate movements and related\nderivative gain or loss, fair value adjustments on supplemental employee retirement plan (“SERP”) investments, government\nsubsidies, credit facility fees, bank charges, and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expense items that are not\ndirectly related to operations. The gain (loss) on SERP investments is offset by a change in the SERP liability that is recognized\nin Selling and Administrative Expense.\nComponents of Non-operating income (expense), net:\nYear Ended\nJune 30\n(Amounts in Thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nForeign currency/derivative gain (loss) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ (1,425) $ 2,769 $ (4,182)\nGain (loss) on SERP investments . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 680 701 (1,563)\nCredit facilities fees and bank charges . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured\ninto functional currencies at end-of-period exchange rates, except for nonmonetary assets and equity, which are remeasured at\nhistorical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at the weighted average exchange rate during the fiscal year,\nexcept for expenses related to nonmonetary assets, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains and losses from\nforeign currency remeasurement are reported in Non-operating income or expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFor business units whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, the translation of functional currency statements to\nU.S. dollar statements uses end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities, weighted average exchange rates for revenue\nand expenses, and historical rates for equity. The resulting currency translation adjustment is recorded in Accumulated Other\nComprehensive Income (Loss), as a component of Share Owners’ Equity.\n49\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities:\nDerivative financial instruments are recognized on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities and are measured at fair value.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings or Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\n(Loss), depending on whether a derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedge transaction, and if it is, the type of\nhedge transaction. Hedge accounting is utilized when a derivative is expected to be highly effective upon execution and\ncontinues to be highly effective over the duration of the hedge transaction. Hedge accounting permits gains and losses on\nderivative instruments to be deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and subsequently included in\nearnings in the periods in which earnings are affected by the hedged item. For transactions and balances denominated in\ncurrencies other than functional currencies, we use forward purchases to manage exposure to the variability of cash flows and\nforeign exchange contracts to hedge intercompany balances and other balance sheet positions. Cash receipts and cash payments\nrelated to derivative instruments are recorded in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged on the\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 14 - Derivative Instruments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nfor more information on derivative instruments and hedging activities.\nStock-Based Compensation:\nAs described in Note 10 - Stock Compensation Plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company maintains\nthe 2023 Equity Incentive Plan, which allows for the issuance of incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted\nshares, unrestricted shares, restricted share units, or performance shares and performance units for grant to officers and other\nkey employees, and to members of the Board of Directors who are not employees. The Company also maintains the Kimball\nElectronics, Inc. Non-Employee Directors Stock Compensation Deferral Plan (the “Deferral Plan”), which allows Non-\nEmployee Directors to elect to defer all, or a portion of, their retainer fees in stock. We recognize the cost resulting from share-\nbased payment transactions using a fair-value-based method on a majority of our transactions. The estimated fair value of\noutstanding performance shares is based on the stock price at the date of the grant. Stock-based compensation expense is\nrecognized for the portion of the award for which performance targets have been established and is expected to vest. The\nCompany has elected to account for forfeitures by reversing the compensation costs at the time a forfeiture occurs.\nNew Accounting Standards:\nNot Yet Adopted:\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance on Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures, requiring additional, more detailed information about a reportable segment. The guidance is effective for\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is\npermitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued guidance on Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, intended to enhance the\ntransparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nNote 2 Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nOur revenue from contracts with customers is generated primarily from manufacturing services provided for the production of\nelectronic assemblies, electronic and non-electronic components, medical devices, medical disposables, precision molded\nplastics, and automation, test, and inspection equipment in automotive, medical, and industrial applications, to the specifications\nand designs of our customers. Beginning in fiscal year 2023, the Company changed its presentation of revenue for the industrial\nand public safety end market verticals by combining them into the industrial end market vertical. Beginning in fiscal year 2024,\nthe Company changed its presentation of revenue for miscellaneous sales previously included in Other to include in the\nrespective customers’ end market verticals. Prior year periods have been recast to conform to the current year presentation.\n50\nThe following table disaggregates our revenue by end market vertical for fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022:\nYear Ended\n(Amounts in Millions) 2024 2023 2022\nVertical Markets:\nAutomotive (1) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 826.4 $ 843.8 $ 590.5\nMedical (2) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 425.7 500.7 394.9\nIndustrial (3) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 462.4 478.9 364.1\nTotal net sales . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 1,714.5 $ 1,823.4 $ 1,349.5\n(1) For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, $23.7 million and $8.3 million of the Automotive net sales\nwere previously categorized as Other.\n(2) For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, $6.7 million and $3.2 million of the Medical net sales\nwere previously categorized as Other.\n(3) For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, $4.3 million and $5.9 million of the Industrial net sales\nwere previously categorized as Other.\nFor fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, approximately 96%, 95%, and 95% of our net sales, respectively, were recognized over\ntime as manufacturing services were performed under a customer contract on a product with no alternative use and we have an\nenforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. The remaining sales revenues were recognized at a point in\ntime when the customer obtained control of the products.\nThe timing differences of revenue recognition, billings to our customers, and cash collections from our customers result in\nbilled accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable. Contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets relate to\nunbilled accounts receivable and occur when revenue is recognized over time as manufacturing services are provided and the\nbilling to the customer has not yet occurred as of the balance sheet date, which are generally transferred to receivables in the\nnext fiscal quarter due to the short-term nature of the manufacturing cycle. Contract assets were $76.3 million and $78.8 million\nas of June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Company may receive payments from customers in advance of the satisfaction of performance obligations primarily for\nmaterial price variances, inventory purchases, tooling, or other miscellaneous services or costs. These payments are recognized\nas contract liabilities until the performance obligations are completed and are included in Advances from customers, if\ninventory related, and Accrued expenses, if not inventory related, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets which amounted to $43.1\nmillion and $45.6 million as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our performance obligations are short term in nature and\ntherefore our contract liabilities are all expected to be settled within twelve months. We also have deposits associated with\ninventory purchases classified as long term. See Note 4 - Inventories of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further\ndiscussion.\nNote 3 Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale\nDuring fiscal year 2024, the Company made the decision to divest GES, our automation, test and measurement business unit\n(“disposal group”), and committed to a plan to sell the business, allowing for increased focus and support for the Company’s\nEMS operations. As a result, the disposal group business has met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. Accordingly, the\nCompany classified the assets and liabilities of the disposal group as held for sale during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024.\nThe disposal group did not qualify as discontinued operations as it did not represent a strategic shift that will have a major\neffect on our operations and financial results.\nOnce the disposal group was classified as held for sale, it was reported at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs\nto sell during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The carrying value exceeded the fair value less costs to sell, and the\nCompany recognized impairment charges of $5.8 million and $17.0 million on goodwill and assets held for sale, respectively.\nThe Company ceased recording depreciation and amortization on the applicable assets of the disposal group.\nWe assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when conditions indicate an earlier review is\nnecessary. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we completed\nan impairment analysis for the goodwill recorded in the reporting unit due to the more-likely-than-not expectation of selling the\nreporting unit. We determined the reporting unit’s carrying value was more than its fair value by an amount greater than the\n$5.8 million carrying amount of goodwill and thus was fully impaired. See Note 6 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets of\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on Goodwill.\n51\nThe major classes of assets and liabilities held for sale consisted of the following:\nJune 30,\n(Amounts in Thousands) 2024\nAssets held for sale:\nReceivables, net . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 12,472\nInventories . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,395\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets . . . . 1,237\nProperty and Equipment, net . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5,861\nGoodwill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . —\nOther Intangible Assets, net . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8,010\nOther Assets, net . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12,652\nValuation Allowance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

As a result of impairment already recognized in fiscal year 2024, we do not\nexpect a material gain or loss from the transaction. At June 30, 2024, GES included approximately 400 employees and\noperations in California, China, India, Japan, and Vietnam.\nNote 4 Inventories\nInventories were valued using the lower of first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) cost and net realizable value.

We have received deposits totaling $38.7 million from this customer\nrelated to this inventory, which is included in Other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At June 30, 2023,\nwe had no inventory or customer deposits classified as long-term.\nNote 5 Property and Equipment\nMajor classes of property and equipment consist of the following at June 30, amounts as of June 30, 2024 exclude the amounts\nclassified as held for sale:\n(Amounts in Thousands) 2024 2023\nLand . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 12,902 $ 14,689\nBuildings and improvements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 125,219 125,216\nMachinery and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 402,100 379,006\nConstruction-in-progress . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38,937 41,970\nTotal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 579,158 $ 560,881\nLess: Accumulated depreciation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Amortization expense in future periods is expected to be, in millions, $0.9, $0.6, $0.4, $0.3, and $0.2 in the five\nyears ending June 30, 2029, and $0.6 thereafter. The estimated useful life of internal-use software ranges from 3 to 10 years.\nThe amortization period for the customer relationships, technology, and trade name intangible assets is 15 years, 5 years, and 10\nyears, respectively. We ceased amortization on the intangible assets upon meeting the held for sale classification. See Note 3 -\nAssets and Liabilities Held for Sale of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We\nhave no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives which are not subject to amortization.\nIntangible assets are reviewed for impairment, and their remaining useful lives evaluated for revision, when events or\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the assets.\nNote 7 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\nGuarantees:\nAs of June 30, 2024 and 2023, we had no guarantees issued which were contingent on the future performance of another entity.\nStandby letters of credit may be issued to third-party suppliers and insurance institutions and can only be drawn upon in the\nevent of the Company’s failure to pay its obligations to the beneficiary. We had a maximum financial exposure from unused\nstandby letters of credit totaling $0.4 million as of both June 30, 2024 and 2023. We do not expect circumstances to arise that\nwould require us to perform under any of these arrangements and believe that the resolution of any claims that might arise in\nthe future, either individually or in the aggregate, would not materially affect our consolidated financial statements.\nAccordingly, no liability has been recorded as of June 30, 2024 and 2023 with respect to the standby letters of credit. We also\nmay enter into commercial letters of credit to facilitate payments to vendors and from customers.\nProduct Warranties:\nThe Company provides only assurance-type warranties for a limited time period, which cover primarily workmanship and\nassure that products comply with specifications provided by or agreed upon with the customer. We maintain a provision for\nlimited warranty repair or replacement of products manufactured and sold pursuant to specific manufacturing contract\nagreements that require such provisions. We estimate this product warranty liability at the time of sale based on historical repair\nor replacement cost trends in conjunction with the length of the warranty offered. Management refines this warranty liability\nperiodically based on changes in historical cost trends and in certain cases where specific warranty issues become known. This\nproduct warranty liability and expense were immaterial during fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n54\nNote 8 Credit Facilities\nCredit facilities consisted of the following:\nAvailable\nBorrowing Borrowings Borrowings\nCapacity at Outstanding at Outstanding at\n(Amounts in Millions, in U.S. Dollar Equivalents) June 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nPrimary credit facility (1) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 14.1 $ 285.5 $ 272.1\nSecondary credit facility (2) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100.0 — —\nThailand overdraft credit facility (3,4) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10.1 — —\nChina revolving credit facility (3,5) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6.9 — —\nNetherlands revolving credit facility (3,6) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.6 9.3 9.4\nPoland revolving credit facility (3,7) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5.4 — —\nVietnam credit facility (3,8) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5.0 — —\nTotal credit facilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 142.1 294.8 281.5\nLess: current portion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The primary credit facility provides for $300 million in borrowings, with an option to\nincrease the amount available for borrowing to $450 million at the Company’s request, subject to the consent of each\nlender participating in such increase. This facility is maintained for working capital and general corporate purposes of the\nCompany. A commitment fee is payable on the unused portion of the credit facility which was immaterial to our operating\nresults in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022. The commitment fee on the unused portion of principal amount of the credit\nfacility is payable at a rate that ranges from 10.0 to 25.0 basis points per annum as determined by the Company’s ratio of\nconsolidated total indebtedness to adjusted consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the primary credit facility. Types of\nborrowings available on the primary credit facility include revolving loans, multi-currency term loans, and swingline loans.\nThe interest rate on borrowings is dependent on the type and currencies of borrowings and will be one of the following\noptions:\n• any Term Benchmark borrowing denominated in U.S. Dollars will utilize the Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(“SOFR”), which is a rate per annum equal to the secured overnight financing rate for such business day published\nby the SOFR Administrator, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on the immediately succeeding business day,\nplus the Revolving Commitment Term Benchmark spread which can range from 100.0 to 175.0 basis points based\non the Company’s ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to adjusted consolidated EBITDA;\n• any Term Benchmark borrowing denominated in Euros will utilize the Euro Interbank Offered Rate\n(“EURIBOR”) in effect two target days prior to the advance (adjusted upwards to reflect bank reserve costs) for\nsuch interest period as defined in the agreement, plus the Revolving Commitment Term Benchmark spread which\ncan range from 100.0 to 175.0 basis points based on the Company’s ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to\nadjusted consolidated EBITDA; or\n• the Alternate Base Rate (“ABR”), which is defined as the highest of the fluctuating rate per annum equal to the\nhigher of:\na. Prime Rate in the U.S. last quoted by the Wall Street Journal, and if this is ceased to be quoted, the highest\nbank prime loan rate or similar loan rate quoted by the Federal Reserve Board;\nb. 1/2 of 1% per annum above the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined under the primary credit facility); or\nc. 1% per annum above the Adjusted SOFR Rate (as defined under the primary credit facility);\nplus the Revolving Commitment ABR spread which can range from 0.0 to 75.0 basis points based on the\nCompany’s ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to adjusted consolidated EBITDA.\nThe Company’s financial covenants under the primary credit facility require:\n• a ratio of consolidated total indebtedness minus unencumbered U.S. cash on hand in the United States in excess of\n$15 million to adjusted consolidated EBITDA, determined as of the end of each of its fiscal quarters for the then\nmost recently ended four fiscal quarters, to not be greater than 3.0 to 1.0 provided, however, that for each fiscal\nquarter end during the four quarter period following a material permitted acquisition, as defined in the Credit\nAgreement, the Company will not permit this financial covenant to be greater than 3.5 to 1.0 for each such fiscal\nquarter end, and,\n55\n• an interest coverage ratio, defined as that ratio of consolidated EBITDA for such period to cash interest expense\nfor such period, for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, to not be less than 3.5 to 1.0.\nThe Company had $0.4 million in letters of credit contingently committed against the primary credit facility at both\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023.\n(2) The Company amended its 364-day multi-currency revolving credit facility agreement on January 5, 2024 (the “secondary\ncredit facility”), which allows for borrowings up to $100.0 million, among the Company, as borrower, certain subsidiaries\nof the Company as guarantors, the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent and Bank\nof America, N.A., as Documentation Agent. The secondary credit facility has a maturity date of January 3, 2025. The\nproceeds of the loans are to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company. A commitment\nfee on the unused portion of principal amount of this secondary credit facility is payable at 30.0 basis points per annum.\nThe interest rate on borrowings is dependent on the type of borrowings and will be one of the following options:\n• any Term Benchmark borrowing denominated in U.S. Dollars will utilize the Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(“SOFR”), which is a rate per annum equal to the secured overnight financing rate for such business day published\nby the SOFR Administrator, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on the immediately succeeding business day,\nplus a Revolving Commitment Term Benchmark spread of 175.0 basis points;\n• any Term Benchmark borrowing denominated in Euros will utilize the Euro Interbank Offered Rate\n(“EURIBOR”) in effect two target days prior to the advance (adjusted upwards to reflect bank reserve costs) for\nsuch interest period as defined in the agreement, plus a Revolving Commitment Term Benchmark spread of 175.0\nbasis points; or\n• the Alternate Base Rate (“ABR”), which is defined as the highest of the fluctuating rate per annum equal to the\nhigher of:\na. Prime Rate in the U.S. last quoted by the Wall Street Journal, and if this is ceased to be quoted, the highest\nbank prime loan rate or similar loan rate quoted by the Federal Reserve Board;\nb. 1/2 of 1% per annum above the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined under the primary credit facility); or\nc. 1% per annum above the Adjusted SOFR Rate (as defined under the primary credit facility);\nplus a Revolving Commitment ABR spread of 75.0 basis points.\nThe Company’s financial covenants under this secondary credit facility are the same as the financial covenants for its\nprimary credit facility.\n(3) The Company also maintains foreign credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes at specific foreign\nlocations rather than utilizing funding from intercompany sources. These foreign credit facilities can be canceled at any\ntime by either the bank or us and generally include renewal clauses. Interest on borrowing under these facilities is charged\nat a rate as defined under the respective foreign credit facility.\n(4) The Company maintains a foreign credit facility for its operation in Thailand which allows for borrowings of up to $10.1\nmillion.\n(5) The Company entered into a foreign credit facility for its EMS operation in China with a new lender during the current\nfiscal year which allows for borrowings up to 50 million RMB (approximately $6.9 million at June 30, 2024 exchange\nrates) and canceled the prior credit facility which allowed for borrowings up to $7.5 million.\n(6) The Company also maintains an uncommitted revolving credit facility for our Netherlands subsidiary. The Netherlands\ncredit facility allows for borrowings of up to 9.2 million Euro (approximately $9.9 million at June 30, 2024 exchange\nrates), which borrowings can be made in Euro, U.S. dollars, or other optional currency. Interest on borrowing under this\nfacility is charged at a rate of interest dependent on the denomination of the currency borrowed.\n(7) The Company entered into a foreign credit facility for its operation in Poland which allows for borrowings up to 5.0 million\nEuro (approximately $5.4 million at June 30, 2024 exchange rates).\n(8) The Company entered into a foreign credit facility for its operation in Vietnam which allows for borrowings up to $5.0\nmillion.\n(9) The amount of Long-term debt under credit facilities, less current maturities reflects the borrowings on the primary credit\nfacility that the Company intends, and has the ability, to refinance for a period longer than twelve months. The primary\ncredit facility matures on May 4, 2027.\nThe weighted-average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the credit facilities at both June 30, 2024 and June 30,\n2023 were 6.8%. Capitalized interest expense was immaterial during fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n56\nNote 9 Employee Benefit Plans\nDefined Contribution Retirement Plans:\nThe Company maintains a trusteed defined contribution retirement plan which is in effect for substantially all domestic\nemployees meeting the eligibility requirements. The Company matches 50% of eligible employee contributions up to 6%. The\nCompany also provides a discretionary contribution determined annually by the Talent, Culture, and Compensation Committee\nof the Company’s Board of Directors. Total expense related to employer contributions to the domestic retirement plans was, in\nmillions, $4.8, $6.1, and $4.2 for fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company also maintains a supplemental employee retirement plan (“SERP”) for executives and other key employees\nwhich enables them to defer cash compensation on a pre-tax basis and restore amounts that would be otherwise payable under\nour tax-qualified retirement plans if the IRS did not have limits on includable compensation and maximum benefits. The SERP\nis structured as a rabbi trust, and therefore, assets in the SERP portfolio are subject to creditor claims in the event of\nbankruptcy. We recognize SERP investment assets on the balance sheet at current fair value. A SERP liability of the same\namount is recorded on the balance sheet representing an obligation to distribute SERP funds to participants. As of June 30,\n2024, both total investments and obligations under SERP were $5.4 million, of which $2.0 million were short term and $3.4\nmillion were long term. As of June 30, 2023, both total investments and obligations under SERP were $8.7 million, of which\n$2.7 million were short term and $6.0 million were long term. The SERP investment assets are classified as trading, and\naccordingly, realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in the Other Income (Expense) category on our\nConsolidated Statements of Income. Adjustments made to revalue the SERP liability are also recognized in income as selling\nand administrative expenses and offset valuation adjustments on SERP investment assets. The change in net unrealized holding\ngains for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was approximately $0.5 million, $0.2 million, and $(2.2) million,\nrespectively.\nDefined Benefit Postemployment Plans:\nThe Company established and maintains severance plans for all domestic employees and other postemployment plans for\ncertain foreign subsidiaries. There are no statutory requirements for us to contribute to the plans, nor do employees contribute to\nthe plans. The plans hold no assets. Benefits are paid using available cash on hand when eligible employees meet plan\nqualifications for payment. As of June 30, 2024, total obligations under these plans were $7.0 million of which $6.2 million\nwere long term and $0.8 million were short term. As of June 30, 2023, total obligations under these plans were $6.6 million of\nwhich $5.6 million were long term and $1.0 million were short term. Net periodic benefit costs were not material for the twelve\nmonths ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\nNote 10 Stock Compensation Plans\nA stock compensation plan was created and adopted by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) on September 20,\n2023 and approved by our Share Owners at our 2023 Annual Meeting on November 17, 2023. The 2023 Plan allows for the\nissuance of up to 2 million shares and replaced our former 2014 plan. The shares under the 2023 Plan may be granted in the\nform of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted awards, performance share\nawards, cash awards, and other equity awards. The Plan is a ten-year plan that terminates automatically on November 17, 2033.\nNo award shall be granted pursuant to the Plan after such date, but awards theretofore granted may extend beyond that date.\nOn October 20, 2016, the Board approved a nonqualified deferred stock compensation plan, the Kimball Electronics, Inc. Non-\nEmployee Directors Stock Compensation Deferral Plan (the “Deferral Plan”), which allows Non-Employee Directors to elect to\ndefer all, or a portion of, their retainer fees in stock until retirement or termination from the Board or death. The Deferral Plan\nallows for issuance of up to 1.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock.\nPre-tax stock compensation charged against income in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $7.2 million, $6.9 million, and\n$6.2 million, respectively. These costs are included in Selling and Administrative Expenses.\nPerformance Shares:\nWe made long-term performance share grants to officers and other key employees. The Talent, Culture, and Compensation\nCommittee of the Board approved these annual performance share grants. Grants cliff vest at the third anniversary of the award\ndate.\nUnder these grants, a number of shares will be awarded to each participant based upon a combination of the Company’s\nprofitability based on its operating income over the performance period as defined in the Company’s operating business plans\nfor the applicable fiscal years and the Company’s growth based on a comparison of its three-year revenue compounded annual\ngrowth rate (“CAGR”) with the Electronics Manufacturing Services Industry’s three-year revenue CAGR. The number of\nshares issued will be less than the targeted shares issuable if the Company does not reach 100% of one or both of the above-\n57\nmentioned performance metrics, and could be zero if the Company does not reach the required minimum thresholds of either\nmetric. The number of shares issued will exceed the number of targeted issuable shares granted (up to a maximum of 125%) if\nthe Company exceeds 100% of one or both of the above-mentioned incentive metrics. The Company recognizes expense based\non management’s expectation of achievement of the specific performance metrics monitored throughout the service period of\nthe awards.\nThe Talent, Culture, and Compensation Committee of the Board approved an additional long-term performance share grant of\n35,033 shares to a key employee in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. Any awards will vest over a 5-year performance\ncycle, with one-third of the interest in the shares vesting after fiscal year 2026, another one-third after fiscal year 2027, and the\nfinal one-third after fiscal year 2028. The vesting of the performance share awards could range from 0% to 100% of the targeted\nissuable shares granted, dependent on the achievement of specific non-financial performance metrics.\nIf a participant is not employed on the date shares are issued, the performance share award is forfeited, except in the case of a\nQualifying Termination (a termination of service due to death, Disability, or Retirement), as defined by the Plan.\nA summary of the Company’s performance share activity during fiscal year 2024 is presented below:\nWeighted Average\nNumber Grant Date\nof Shares Fair Value\nPerformance shares outstanding at July 1, 2023 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 375,554 $ 23.77\nGranted . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 212,464 $ 28.38\nVested . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

That cost is expected to be recognized over performance periods\nending August 2024 through August 2028, with a weighted average vesting period of 1.5 years. The fair value of performance\nshares is based on the stock price at the date of grant. During fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, 82,744, 225,142,\nand 214,099 performance shares vested at a fair value of $1.6 million, $4.3 million, and $3.3 million.

This grant was approved by the Talent, Culture, and Compensation Committee of the Board.\nThe participant will earn from 0% to 100% of the grant based on the total shareholder return ranking of the Company compared\nto the performance peer group at the end of the three-year performance period. TSR performance shares are expensed over the\ncontractual vesting period as earned. The shares will vest on March 1, 2026. If the employment of a holder of TSR performance\nshares terminates before the TSR performance shares have vested for any reason other than death, retirement, or total\npermanent disability, the TSR performance shares will be forfeited. During fiscal year 2023, the Company granted 42,626 TSR\nperformance shares at an average grant date fair value of $16.88 for a total fair value of $0.7 million. The grant date fair value\nof the TSR performance share grants was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation, with the assistance of a third-party\nvaluation specialist. No TSR performance shares were awarded during fiscal year 2024.\nUnrestricted Share Grants:\nUnrestricted shares were granted to key employees and non-employee members of the Board as consideration for services\nrendered. Unrestricted share grants do not have vesting periods, holding periods, restrictions on sale, or other restrictions.

During fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022,\nrespectively, the Company granted a total of 18,128, 13,950, and 6,777 unrestricted shares at an average grant date fair value of\n$25.24, $23.30, and $23.10 for a total fair value of $0.5 million, $0.3 million, and $0.2 million. Unrestricted shares are awarded\nto non-employee members of the Board as compensation for director’s fees, including fees that directors elected to receive as\nunrestricted shares in lieu of cash payment. Directors’ fees are expensed over the period that directors earn the compensation.\nUnrestricted shares that are awarded to key employees are expensed immediately.\n58\nRestricted Shares:\nRestricted shares were granted to employees as consideration for services rendered. The contractual life of the restricted shares\nis three years, with one-third of the interest in the restricted shares vested after year one of the grant, another one-third after year\ntwo of the grant, and the final one-third after year three of the grant. Additional restricted share grants were approved by the\nTalent, Culture, and Compensation Committee of the Board and 23,356 shares were granted to a key employee in the second\nquarter of fiscal year 2024. The awards will vest over a 5-year service period, with one-third of the interest in the shares vesting\nafter fiscal year 2026, another one-third after fiscal year 2027, and the final one-third after fiscal year 2028.\nRestricted shares are expensed over the contractual vesting period as earned. If a participant is not employed on the date shares\nare issued, the restricted share award is forfeited, except in the case of a Qualifying Termination (a termination of service due to\ndeath, Disability, or Retirement), as defined by the Plan.

The\ncost is expected to be recognized over vesting periods ending August 2024 through August 2028, with a weighted average\nvesting period of 1.4 years. The fair value of the restricted shares is based on the stock price at the date of grant. During fiscal\nyears 2024 and 2023, respectively, 20,768 and 6,458 restricted shares vested. The restricted shares vested represent the total\nnumber of shares vested prior to the reduction of shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations.\nDeferred Share Units:\nDeferred share units may be granted to non-employee members of the Board under the Deferral Plan as compensation for the\nportion of their annual retainer fees resulting from their election to receive deferred share units in lieu of cash payment or\nunrestricted shares. Directors’ fees are expensed over the period that directors earn the compensation. Deferred share units are\nparticipating securities and are payable in common stock in a lump sum or installments in accordance with deferral elections\nupon a director’s death, retirement, or termination of service with the Board. During fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022,\nrespectively, 26,347, 39,032, and 34,480 deferred share units were granted to non-employee members of the Board at an\naverage grant date fair value of $25.24, $23.07, and $24.87 for a total fair value of $0.7 million, $0.9 million, and $0.9 million.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, no shares of common stock were issued under the Deferral Plan.\nNote 11 Income Taxes\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform”) was enacted into law on December 22, 2017, making broad and complex\nchanges to the U.S. tax code. Tax Reform required a one-time transition tax on certain unremitted earnings of foreign\nsubsidiaries that is payable over an eight-year period. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the remaining provision recorded for the\none-time deemed repatriation tax were $5.9 million and $7.8 million, respectively, payable through fiscal year 2026, with the\nlong-term portion recorded in Long-term income taxes payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 30, 2024 and\n2023, $2.6 million and $1.9 million of the remaining deemed repatriation tax is short term and is recorded in Accrued expenses\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities\nfor financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.\n59\nThe components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, were as follows, amounts as of June 30,\n2024 exclude $11.1 million of deferred tax assets and $1.2 million of deferred tax liabilities classified as held for sale:\n(Amounts in Thousands) 2024 2023\nDeferred Tax Assets:\nReceivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 244 $ 77\nInventory . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,465 3,293\nEmployee benefits . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 378 276\nDeferred compensation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8,046 9,013\nCapitalized research and development . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5,682 3,501\nTax credit carryforwards . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6,171 5,930\nGoodwill . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — 746\nNet operating loss carryforward . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 364 2,529\nNet foreign currency losses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 —\nBusiness interest carryforward . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,396 871\nAsset impairment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,099 —\nMiscellaneous . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,509 2,229\nValuation Allowance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Income tax\nbenefits associated with tax credit carryforwards primarily expire from fiscal year 2025 to 2033. A valuation allowance was\nprovided as of June 30, 2024 and 2023 for deferred tax assets related to certain state credits of $5.8 million and $4.3 million,\nrespectively. Additionally, in fiscal year 2024, we recorded a full $3.4 million valuation allowance on the business interest\ncarryforward deferred tax asset, following a determination that it is more likely than not that it will not be realized. Except as\nreserved for in the valuation allowance, we believe our deferred income taxes are more likely than not to be realized in the\nfuture.\nThe components of income before taxes on income are as follows:\nYear Ended June 30\n(Amounts in Thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nUnited States . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ (35,055) $ (6,269) $ 1,542\nForeign . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 60,254 81,013 42,189\nTotal income before taxes on income . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 25,199 $ 74,744 $ 43,731\nThe Company currently operates international jurisdictions which expose the Company to taxation in various regions.

We are no longer subject to any significant U.S. federal tax examinations by tax authorities for\nyears before fiscal year 2018. We are subject to income tax examinations by various, state, local, and foreign jurisdiction tax\nauthorities for years after June 30, 2018.\nNote 12 Share Owners’ Equity\nThe Company has a Board-authorized stock repurchase plan (the “repurchase plan”) allowing the purchase of up to $100\nmillion of our common stock. Purchases may be made under various programs, including in open-market transactions, block\ntransactions on or off an exchange, or in privately negotiated transactions, all in accordance with applicable securities laws and\nregulations. The Repurchase Plan has no expiration date but may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, the Company repurchased $3.0 million of common stock under the Repurchase Plan at an average\nprice of $22.12 per share. The Company did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2023. During fiscal year 2022, the\nCompany repurchased $9.1 million of common stock under the Repurchase Plan at an average price of $18.82 per share, which\nwas recorded as Treasury stock, at cost in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Since the inception of the Repurchase Plan, the\nCompany has repurchased $91.8 million of common stock at an average cost of $15.43 per share.\nNote 13 Fair Value\nThe Company categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used\nto price the assets or liabilities. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, whereas level 3 generally requires\nsignificant management judgment. The three levels are defined as follows:\n• Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\n• Level 2: Observable inputs other than those included in level 1. For example, quoted prices for similar assets or\nliabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets.\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting management’s own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or\nliability.\nThere were no changes in the inputs or valuation techniques used to measure fair values during fiscal year 2024.\n62\nFinancial Instruments Recognized at Fair Value:\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to measure fair value:\nFinancial Instrument Level Valuation Technique/Inputs Used\nCash Equivalents 1 Market - Quoted market prices\nDerivative Assets: Foreign exchange 2 Market - Based on observable market inputs using standard\ncontracts calculations, such as time value, forward interest rate yield curves,\nand current spot rates, considering counterparty credit risk\nTrading securities: Mutual funds held in 1 Market - Quoted market prices\nSERP\nDerivative Liabilities: Foreign exchange 2 Market - Based on observable market inputs using standard\ncontracts calculations, such as time value, forward interest rate yield curves,\nand current spot rates adjusted for Kimball Electronics’ non-\nperformance risk\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements:\nAs of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the fair values of financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring\nbasis using the market approach are categorized as follows:\nJune 30, 2024\n(Amounts in Thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Total\nAssets\nDerivatives: foreign exchange contracts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ — $ 1,420 $ 1,420\nTrading securities: mutual funds held in nonqualified SERP . . . . . . . . . 5,445 — 5,445\nTotal assets at fair value . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 5,445 $ 1,420 $ 6,865\nLiabilities\nDerivatives: foreign exchange contracts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ — $ 2,485 $ 2,485\nTotal liabilities at fair value . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ — $ 2,485 $ 2,485\nJune 30, 2023\n(Amounts in Thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Total\nAssets\nDerivatives: foreign exchange contracts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ — $ 6,320 $ 6,320\nTrading securities: mutual funds held in nonqualified SERP . . . . . . . . 8,668 — 8,668\nTotal assets at fair value . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 8,668 $ 6,320 $ 14,988\nLiabilities\nDerivatives: foreign exchange contracts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ — $ 1,245 $ 1,245\nTotal liabilities at fair value . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ — $ 1,245 $ 1,245\nWe had no level 3 assets or liabilities as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, or any activity in level 3 assets or liabilities during fiscal\nyears 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nThe nonqualified supplemental employee retirement plan (“SERP”) assets consist primarily of equity funds, balanced funds,\nbond funds, and a money market fund. The SERP investment assets are offset by a SERP liability which represents the\nCompany’s obligation to distribute SERP funds to participants. See Note 9 - Employee Benefit Plans of Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for further information regarding the SERP.\nNon-Recurring Fair Value Measurements:\nDuring fiscal year 2024, the automation, test and measurement business unit met the criteria to be classified as held for sale, and\nas a result, a valuation allowance of $17.0 million was established to reflect the fair value less cost to sell of the disposal group,\nwhich was based on expected proceeds and the estimated carrying value of the net assets to be disposed. We utilized level 3\ninputs based on management’s best estimates and assumptions to estimate the fair value. See Note 3 - Assets and Liabilities\nHeld for Sale of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n63\nFinancial Instruments Not Carried At Fair Value:\nFinancial instruments that are not reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value that have carrying amounts which\napproximate fair value include the following:\nFinancial Instrument Level Valuation Technique/Inputs Used\nNotes receivable 2 Market - Price approximated based on the assumed collection of\nreceivables in the normal course of business, taking into account\nnon-performance risk\nBorrowings under credit facilities 2 Market - Based on observable market rates, taking into account\nKimball Electronics’ non-performance risk\nThe carrying values of our cash deposit accounts, trade accounts receivable, and trade accounts payable approximate fair value\ndue to their relatively short maturity and immaterial non-performance risk.\nNote 14 Derivative Instruments\nForeign Exchange Contracts:\nWe operate internationally and are therefore exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of\nbusiness. Our primary means of managing this exposure is to utilize natural hedges, such as aligning currencies used in the\nsupply chain with the sale currency. To the extent natural hedging techniques do not fully offset currency risk, we use\nderivative instruments with the objective of reducing the residual exposure to certain foreign currency rate movements. Factors\nconsidered in the decision to hedge an underlying market exposure include the materiality of the risk, the volatility of the\nmarket, the duration of the hedge, the degree to which the underlying exposure is committed to, and the availability,\neffectiveness, and cost of derivative instruments. Derivative instruments are only utilized for risk management purposes and are\nnot used for speculative or trading purposes.\nWe use forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in\nforecasted transactions denominated in a foreign currency. Non-designated foreign exchange contracts are also used to hedge\nagainst foreign currency exchange rate risks related to intercompany balances and other balance sheet positions denominated in\ncurrencies other than the functional currencies. As of June 30, 2024, we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts to hedge\ncurrencies against the U.S. dollar in the aggregate notional amount of $32.9 million and to hedge currencies against the Euro in\nthe aggregate notional amount of 65.0 million Euro. The notional amounts are indicators of the volume of derivative activities\nbut may not be indicators of the potential gain or loss on the derivatives.\nIn limited cases due to unexpected changes in forecasted transactions, cash flow hedges may cease to meet the criteria to be\ndesignated as cash flow hedges. Depending on the type of exposure hedged, we may either purchase a derivative contract in the\nopposite position of the undesignated hedge or may retain the hedge until it matures if the hedge continues to provide an\nadequate offset in earnings against the currency revaluation impact of foreign currency denominated liabilities.\nThe fair value of outstanding derivative instruments is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a derivative asset or\nliability and presented with Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Accrued expenses, respectively. When derivatives are\nsettled with the counterparty, the derivative asset or liability is relieved and cash flow is impacted for the net settlement. For\nderivative instruments that meet the criteria of hedging instruments under FASB guidance, the gain or loss on the derivative\ninstrument is initially recorded net of related tax effect in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), a component of\nShare Owners’ Equity, and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period or periods during which the hedged\ntransaction is recognized in earnings. The gain or loss associated with derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging\ninstruments or that cease to meet the criteria for hedging under FASB guidance is reported immediately in Non-operating\nincome (expense), net on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nBased on fair values as of June 30, 2024, we estimate that approximately $1.6 million of pre-tax derivative loss deferred in\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss will be reclassified into earnings, along with the earnings effects of related forecasted\ntransactions, within the next twelve months. Losses on foreign exchange contracts are generally offset by gains in operating\nincome in the income statement when the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Because gains or losses on\nforeign exchange contracts fluctuate partially based on currency spot rates, the future effect on earnings of the cash flow hedges\nalone is not determinable, but in conjunction with the underlying hedged transactions, the result is expected to be a decline in\ncurrency risk. The maximum length of time we had hedged our exposure to the variability in future cash flows was 12 months\nas of both June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023.\n64\nSee Note 13 - Fair Value of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the fair value of\nderivative assets and liabilities and Note 18 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) of Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for the changes in deferred derivative gains and losses.\nInformation on the location and amounts of derivative fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and derivative gains and\nlosses in the Consolidated Statements of Income are presented below.\nFair Values of Derivative Instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nAsset Derivatives Liability Derivatives\nFair Value As of Fair Value As of\nJune 30 June 30 Balance Sheet June 30 June 30\n(Amounts in Thousands) Balance Sheet Location 2024 2023 Location 2024 2023\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments:\nPrepaid expenses and other current\nForeign exchange contracts . . assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 966 $ 4,772 Accrued expenses . . $ 2,330 $ 844\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:\nPrepaid expenses and other current\nForeign exchange contracts . . assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 454 1,548 Accrued expenses . . 155 401\nTotal derivatives . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 1,420 $ 6,320 $ 2,485 $ 1,245\nThe Effect of Derivative Instruments on Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nJune 30\n(Amounts in Thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nAmount of Pre-Tax Gain or (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (OCI) on Derivatives:\nForeign exchange contracts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 2,621 $ 9,547 $ 468\nThe Effect of Derivative Instruments on Consolidated Statements of Income\n(Amounts in Thousands) Year Ended June 30\nDerivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships Location of Gain or (Loss) 2024 2023 2022\nAmount of Pre-Tax Gain or (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated OCI into Income:\nForeign exchange contracts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

What is even more impressive is that our plans included offsetting a $100 million reduction in business with a major\nmedical customer involved in an FDA recall. The first quarter of the fiscal year was the best Q1 in our Company history,\nbut we recognized that end-market demand was weakening across each of the vertical markets we serve from macro\nheadwinds, and we had to respond. Our response was an approach of “controlling what we can control” including\nresizing our team, sharpening our strategic focus, taking other actions to reduce costs, and continuing to focus on\nsignificant improvements in working capital management.\nConsistent with our focus on building long-term relationships, 76% of our revenue was with customers we’ve worked\nwith for a decade, or more, and for the tenth consecutive year, we were recognized by CIRCUITS ASSEMBLY in multiple\ncategories for Service Excellence.\nWe also provided our annual ESG disclosures by publishing the 2023 Guiding Principles Report, themed “How We Are\nWinning Together, The Kimball Way”. The report reflects the deep roots of sustainability in our culture, and highlights\nnumerous sustainability-related recognitions and accomplishments from calendar 2023. I believe it is our finest and\ndemonstrates our dedication to the Guiding Principles of Customers, People, Citizenship, and Profits.\nThroughout fiscal 2024, I spent a great deal of time visiting our locations, meeting with customers, and working with our\nLeadership Team to complete an in-depth review of our strategic focus, vertical market structure, and organization\ndesign.\nOur Company has been in operation for over 60 years – 10 of them listed on Nasdaq – and we have weathered many\nstorms. But we have also recognized when to “cast the net a little wider” by moving into new markets where our core\nmanufacturing capabilities support emerging technology. With our renewed strategic focus on EMS operations, and a\nstrong balance sheet, we will be looking with a new lens on where – and how – to profitably increase the top line.\nThroughout this journey, we will stay true to our Guiding Principles and continue to:\n• Be collaborative and team-oriented,\n• Set high aspirations…not unrealistic goals, but attainable targets that require stretching,\n• Communicate openly and proactively, and\n• Remain accountable to our Company, to our customers, to each other, and to our Share Owners.\nFor more detailed insights into the past year, I encourage you to read our Annual\nReport and Form 10-K, as well as to follow updates on our website at\nwww.kimballelectronics.com. Please review this 2024 Proxy Statement and the Q&A\nwith information about the 2024 Annual Meeting. Your active participation is vital to us.\nI would like to extend a personal invitation for you to attend our annual meeting in\nperson at our Kimball Electronics Headquarters, located at 1205 Kimball Boulevard in\nJasper, Indiana, beginning on Friday, November 15, 2024, at 10:00 A.M., Eastern\nStandard Time (EST).

Annual elections risk the potential instability of the\nelection of a very inexperienced Board.\n• Long-Term Focus - As a public company, the Board’s primary focus is on the long-term best interests of our\nShare Owners. This includes oversight of the long-term strategic vision of the Company. A three-year term\nenables effective execution of that vision.\n• Share Owner Accountability - Our classified Board has at least two directors who stand for election each year,\nwhich promotes accountability to Share Owners. In addition, the Board is accountable to long-term Share\nOwners through its existing governance principles, including board refreshment; tenure and retirement age\npolicies; a strong independent chairperson; and a commitment to diversity. In addition, the Board has a robust\ncommitment to direct engagement with our Share Owners, including by conducting regular say on pay\nadvisory votes.\n• Share Owner Value - The Board has reviewed well-reasoned academic research both for and against the\nproposition that the classification or declassification of a board has a correlation to increased Share Owner\nvalue. Therefore, the Board has judged this not to be a compelling reason for declassification.\n• Statutory Requirement - As an Indiana company, Indiana corporate statutes mandate a classified board\nstructure. While the Company states in its By-Laws that it does not intend for these provisions of Indiana's\ncorporate statutes to apply to the classes and terms of its Directors, the statutes reflect the judgment of the\nelected legislators of our state of incorporation as to an appropriate board structure.\nBoard and Annual Meeting Attendance\nDuring fiscal year 2024, the Board met 7 times and each director then in office attended at least 75% of the aggregate\nof the total number of meetings of the Board and the total number of meetings held by all Committees of the Board on\nwhich such director served during their tenure. All of our directors attended our last Annual Meeting of Share Owners.\nWe expect our directors to attend all Board and applicable Committee meetings, calls regarding specific initiatives or\nacquisitions, and the 2024 Annual Meeting of Share Owners.\nDirector Independence and Refreshment\nThe Board consists of a majority of “independent directors,” as noted in the table above and as defined by the listing\nstandards of Nasdaq. The Board also evaluates any circumstances that may affect a director’s ability to exercise\nindependent judgment, such as the director’s and the director’s family members’ employment and other relationships\nwith us or our advisors, auditors, or significant customers; whether the director or a family member has accepted any\npayments from us or our subsidiaries, other than those permitted by SEC rules; and any actual or potential conflicts of\ninterest.\nThe independent directors nominated for election are Mr. Lampert and Ms. Repplier. The Board has determined that\nnone of our independent directors have a relationship with us that would interfere with the exercise of their\nindependent judgment in carrying out their responsibilities as directors. There are no family relationships among any of\nour directors or executive officers, and during the past 10 years, none of our directors or executive officers has been\ninvolved in any legal proceeding identified in Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K. All of our independent directors meet after\neach Board meeting for regularly scheduled executive sessions and at other times as they deem appropriate.\nWe are committed to board refreshment. To strike a balance between retaining independent directors with deep\nknowledge of our business and adding directors with a fresh perspective, the Board seeks to maintain an average\ntenure of less than 10 years for its independent directors as a group by setting reasonable term limits. The current\naverage tenure for our independent directors as of the end of fiscal year 2024 is 6.6 years.\n15\nDirector Compensation\nFiscal Year 2024 Compensation to Non-Employee Directors\nDirectors’ compensation is set by the Board. The level of compensation is guided by the following goals: compensation\nshould fairly pay directors for work required in a company of Kimball Electronics’ size and scope; and the structure of\nthe compensation should be simple, transparent, market-competitive, easy to understand, and aligned with Share\nOwner interests. Non-employee Directors receive an annual cash retainer and an annual equity award. Kimball\nElectronics does not provide Directors who are also Company employees any additional compensation for serving as\na Director.\nThe table below reflects the annual rates as of June 30, 2024. This information may be different from the fees provided\nin the Non-Employee Director Compensation table, which reflects actual fees received for roles served during the past\nfiscal year:\nCompensation Component Annual Rate\nAnnual Retainer Fee $ 65,000\nAnnual Equity Award (1) $ 125,000\nChairperson Retainer $ 40,000\nAudit Committee Chair Retainer $ 20,000\nTCC Committee Chair Retainer $ 15,000\nNESG Committee Chair Retainer $ 15,000\nAudit Committee Member Retainer (2) $ 10,000\nTCC Committee Member Retainer (2) $ 7,500\nNESG Committee Member Retainer (2) $ 7,500\n(1) Paid in shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Company’s 2023 Equity Incentive Plan and the Non-Employee Directors Stock\nCompensation Deferral Plan.\n(2) Paid for each Committee on which a Director serves.\nDirectors are able to elect to receive all, or a portion of, their retainer fees in common stock. Directors also may elect to\ndefer, all or a portion of their retainer fees until termination of service from the Board. We also reimburse Directors for\nreasonable travel, continuing education, and other expenses incurred in connection with Board and Committee\nservice and meeting attendance. There are no agreements or arrangements between any Director or Director\nnominee and any person or entity other than the Company relating to compensation or other payment in connection\nwith the Director or Director nominee’s candidacy or service.\nThe following Non-Employee Director Compensation Table shows the compensation paid to each Non-employee\nDirector during fiscal year 2024.\nNon-Employee Director Compensation in Fiscal Year 2024\nName Fees Earned or Paid in Cash ($) (1) Stock Awards ($) (2) Total ($)\n(a) (b) (c) (h)\nMichele A.

Mr. Lampert’s, Mr. Phillippy’s, and Ms. Van\nDeursen’s fiscal year 2024 equity retainer awards were issued to them under the 2023 Plan.\n16\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE AT KIMBALL ELECTRONICS\nGovernance Philosophy\nAs reflected in our Vision and Guiding Principles, Kimball Electronics is committed to the highest standards of ethical\nconduct in its business dealings. Kimball believes that the Company, through its Board of Directors, executive\nmanagement, and employees, should reflect our Guiding Principles in the structure of our governance. We are\naligned, engaged, and operating in an environment of mutual trust and respect. Ethics are the foundation of the\nCorporate Governance Principles. The Nominating and ESG Committee of the Board periodically reviews the\nCompany’s overall governance structure, including our Corporate Governance Principles, and makes\nrecommendations on governance issues or practices as warranted.\nShare Owner Rights\nKimball Electronics strives to implement good governance practices and to ensure that we and our Board align with\nthe long-term interests of our Share Owners. We have enhanced our corporate governance framework over time\nbased on input from our Board, Share Owners, and other governance experts. Important Share Owner rights include:\n• Single class of shares with each share entitled to one vote\n• No multiple voting rights, enhanced voting rights, voting rights ceilings, voting certificates, or non-voting shares\n• Majority voting standard for directors in uncontested elections; resignation procedures if not elected\n• Simple majority vote to amend our By-Laws\n• Share Owner right to call special meetings with 25% ownership\n• Eligible Share Owners may nominate directors through proxy access\n• Share Owner approval required to materially modify our equity capital structure\n• Confidential voting policy\n• Board tenure policy that seeks to maintain an average Board tenure of less than 10 years for the Board’s\nindependent directors\nThe Board’s Strategic Planning Role\nThe Board works actively with management to formulate and review our long-term corporate strategy. Each quarter,\nthe Board and management confer on the execution of our long-term strategic plans, the status of key initiatives, and\nthe key opportunities and risks we face. In addition, the Board regularly conducts in-depth, long-term strategic reviews\nwith our senior management team, and dedicates substantial parts of two meetings each year to developing our\nlong-term strategy and to reviewing and approving management’s strategic plan for the Company. During these\nreviews, the Board and management discuss the overall business landscape, emerging competitive threats in our\nindustries, and short and long-term plans and priorities within our strategy. Through these processes, the Board brings its\ncollective, independent judgment to bear on the most critical long-term strategic issues facing Kimball Electronics.\nHow the Board Addresses and Oversees Risk\nThe Board takes an active role, as a whole and at the committee level, in overseeing management of our risks. The\nBoard approaches our risk management process in an intelligent manner based on the fundamental recognition that\nrisk management in any business enterprise requires an appropriate balance of two distinct aspects of risk:\n• Value Preservation — recognizing and mitigating as much as possible the risk of potential for loss or harm to any\nelement of our business.\n• Value Creation — embracing the risks inherent in any business endeavor in order to reap the rewards of growth\nand profitability.\nWe have a continuous, four-phase Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process based on risk program development, risk\nassessment and prioritization, risk response, and risk validation and monitoring. We evaluate a broad range of\noperational, strategic, compliance, and reporting risks and incorporate risk criteria into the development of the\nproducts and services that we offer our customers. Throughout the year, experts, leaders, and specialists across\nfunctions, geographies, and levels meet to identify, on a continual basis, the most pressing current and future potential\nrisks we face. Individually and collectively, our senior leaders continually monitor, reassess, and validate risks and\nmitigation efforts, including through regular meetings of our executive team. Our leaders and employees receive\nfocused, annual, and mandatory risk management education throughout each year. Led by experienced risk and\ncompliance professionals from our Audit Management Services team, our senior leaders also meet quarterly to\nanalyze, rank, and prioritize these potential risks along continuums of “likelihood” and “impact” and by “controllability.”\n17\nThese senior leaders and our Audit Management Services team develop plans and strategies to appropriately manage\nand mitigate these risks.\nWe present relevant ERM information, including the most significant risks identified in our ERM process, to relevant Board\ncommittees at each of their quarterly meetings. The Board reviews the same information at each of its meetings\nthrough reports from the Audit, NESG, and TCC Committees about specific financial, governance, and talent/human\ncapital risks and mitigation efforts in areas overseen by those committees. The Board also implements its risk oversight\nresponsibilities by having management provide appropriate briefings and informational sessions on the significant risks\nthat the Company faces. Directly and through its committees, the Board’s engagement with management includes\nbroad strategic and operational discussions about interrelated risks, and more focused discussions about individual\nrisks. For example, the TCC Committee, along with the Board’s independent directors, annually evaluates risks related\nto compensation of our executive officers and our incentive and equity compensation plans. The Audit Committee\nreviews the performance, responsibilities, budget and staffing of the internal audit department and the appointment,\nreassignment, or dismissal of the director of the Company’s internal audit function, ensuring that our risk management\nfunction is structurally independent of our operations.\nBoard Risk Oversight Roles\nOur Share Owners elect our Board to oversee management and to serve Share Owners’ long-term interests. While our\nexecutives are responsible for our day-to-day risk management process, the Board has ultimate responsibility for our risk\nmanagement oversight, shaping effective corporate governance, and setting the right tone for integrity, ethics, and\nculture based on our Guiding Principles, including matters around diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. We have\nprovided examples of risk oversight areas below, and how each Board committee assists the Board with its oversight.\nRisk Oversight Area Audit Committee NESG Committee TCC Committee\nDirector Qualifications, Composition, & Diversity\n• Board Classification\n• Director Independence & Refreshment ☑\n• Director & Executive Education\n• Annual Evaluations of Board, Committees\nDirector Compensation ☑\nStrategy & Enterprise Risk Management\n• Strategy Alignment & Development\n• Risk Assessment & Prioritization\n☑ ☑ ☑\n• Risk Response\n• Risk Validation\n• Risk Monitoring\nAudit Oversight\n• Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\n• External Audit ☑\n• Related Parties & Related Party Transactions\n• Conflicts of Interest\nSustainability\n• Environmental, Health & Safety Disclosures\n• Social Responsibility & Human Rights\n☑\n• Carbon & Climate\n• Water Security\n• Waste & Toxicity\nCybersecurity/Information Security ☑\nTalent & Compensation Management\n• Diversity, Equity, Including & Belonging\n• Total Rewards\n☑\n• Employee Health & Safety\n• Succession Management & Talent Risk\n• CEO Evaluation\nStakeholder Engagement & Government Relations ☑\nPhilanthropy & Community Impact ☑\nAs noted above, another important aspect of the Board’s risk management is proactive director education on the\ntopics necessary to enable the Board to consider timely and salient issues and risks in our industry and business. The\nBoard and its committees, coordinated by the NESG Committee, offer continuing director and executive education\nduring portions of regular board and committee meetings and during select special meetings or outside events.\n18\nContinuing education for our directors and executives helps these leaders keep abreast of our evolving products and\nservices; significant risks and compliance issues; laws, regulations and requirements applicable to us; corporate\ngovernance best practices; and changes in the EMS industry.\nThis education program often takes the form of “white papers” and management- and third party-led presentations.\nAdditionally, the Board and management collect and distribute additional relevant materials that cover timely\nsubjects or topics, which a director can review before a meeting and ask questions about during the meeting.\nContinuing director education also involves directors’ attendance at director education seminars and programs\nsponsored by other organizations. We pay the cost for any director to attend outside director education seminars on\ntopics relevant to their service as directors.\nOur Board and its Committees work closely with management to provide oversight, review, and counsel related to\nlong-term strategy, risks, opportunities, and feedback we receive from our Share Owners. We believe that our Board\nand management leadership structures promote effective Board oversight of risk management.\nSustainability; Environmental, Health and Safety; and Social Responsibility Risk\nOversight\nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines describe our Board’s role in overseeing sustainable development and\nsustainability/ESG Issues such as shaping effective corporate governance; overseeing climate change and\nsustainability policies, programs, goals, and progress; and shaping and overseeing the targets, standards, and other\nmetrics used to measure and track our ethics and compliance, sustainability, EHS, and social responsibility\nperformance. The Board’s Nominating and NESG Committee, comprised exclusively of independent directors,\noversees Kimball’s corporate responsibility and sustainability/ESG programs, including all climate-related issues. The\nNESG Committee also has oversight of our Global Human Rights Policy and our Global Supply Chain Transparency\nStatement, which the Board reviews and approves annually. The NESG Committee’s express responsibilities also\ninclude:\n• Overseeing and advising the Board on our goals, strategies, and initiatives related to climate, sustainability, and\nESG, including climate risks and opportunities; community and social impact; disclosures and external\nstakeholder input related to human rights, human capital management, and diversity, equity, inclusion, and\nbelonging;\n• Reviewing and overseeing our sustainability and ESG-related statements and disclosures, including our annual\nGuiding Principles report, and the policies and procedures that we use to prepare them;\n• Monitoring our performance related to our sustainability and ESG goals, strategies, and initiatives;\n• Overseeing and advising the Board on our sustainability and ESG-related engagement efforts with Share\nOwners and other key stakeholders, including employees, proxy advisory firms, non-governmental organizations\n(NGOs), and key ESG ratings agencies and providers;\n• Developing and overseeing our legal and regulatory compliance and ethics programs, including our\ncompliance with legal and regulatory requirements other than those related to accounting or financial\nreporting (which are the responsibility of the Audit Committee of the Board) or executive and Director\ncompensation (which are the responsibility of the Talent, Culture, and Compensation Committee of the Board);\n• Overseeing, regularly reviewing reports from, and meeting with our Chief Compliance Officer and other\nappropriate members of management regarding significant sustainability and ESG-related events and matters;\n• Reviewing and overseeing the Company’s government relations strategies and activities, including any political\nactivities, contributions, and lobbying activities, including trade associations or other business associations that\nengage in lobbying; and\n• Reviewing and overseeing the Company’s charitable and community investment activities, including\noverseeing the Company’s philanthropy and non-commercial sponsorships policy.\nIn addition to the NESG Committee’s sustainability-specific roles, oversight of the enterprise risk management\nframework and cybersecurity risks are the responsibility of the Board’s Audit Committee. The Board reviews and\napproves our business plans and budgets annually and as necessary to oversee major capital expenditures,\nacquisitions, and divestitures. The Board also sets annual performance objectives and monitors their implementation\n19\nand performance. The Board receives assistance from our Talent, Culture, and Compensation Committee on specific\nsustainability strategies, policies, and key metrics related to our talent and culture, including matters such as pay\nequity, diversity, inclusion, belonging, retention, employee health and safety programs, leadership development and\nsuccession, and the alignment with and advancement of our Guiding Principles. The Board looks to the expertise of its\ncommittees to provide additional strategic oversight in their areas of focus.\nManagement’s leaders for sustainability, environmental, health and safety, and social responsibility report to the Board\nand to the NESG Committee on these matters, and these matters were discussed at each quarterly NESG Committee\nand Board meeting in the last fiscal year. These discussions allow directors to continue to deepen their knowledge base\non sustainability topics relevant to Kimball Electronics. The NESG Committee also regularly receives updates on issues of\nrelevance to our stakeholders, including our Share Owners, which often includes information related to climate risks,\noversight, and disclosure. The NESG Committee works with the Board to program, conduct, and encourage directors to\nattend director education opportunities, with expenses covered by the Company, including for various sustainability\ntopics.\nCybersecurity/Information Security Risk Oversight\nBoth the Board and the Audit Committee have oversight of risks related to information security, data protection, and\ncybersecurity. Cybersecurity protection is vital to maintaining our operations, and the trust of our business and supply\nchain partners, and of our Share Owners. We continue to secure our own manufacturing and information technology\ninfrastructure; to train our employees and directors throughout each year about malware, viruses, hacking, phishing,\nand other information security risks, including how to avoid and mitigate them; and to protect our sensitive data from\nfailures, breaches, or cyber incidents. We maintain appropriate insurance policies to help address information security\nrisks. To assist us in identifying and mitigating information security risks, we also maintain a corporate-wide ISO 27001-\ncertified information security management system.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program is led by our Chief Information Officer (“CIO”), who reports to our CEO\nand manages our security team principally responsible for managing our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, our\nsecurity controls, and our detection and response to cybersecurity incidents. The CIO meets regularly with the CEO and\nhis direct reports to discuss cybersecurity risk and ensure appropriate resources are prioritized to address risks. At each\nof their respective meetings, the Board and Audit Committee receive, and provide feedback on, reports on relevant\ndata protection and cybersecurity matters. Additionally, two regular Board meetings each year and each Audit\nCommittee meeting include additional, in-depth technology and cybersecurity briefings from senior members of our\ninformation technology department, internal audit function, and legal department. The topics covered by these\nreports and briefings include risk management strategies, data protection, ongoing risk mitigation activities,\ncybersecurity strategy, governance structure, and the results of security breach simulations.\nOversight, Review, and Approval of Transactions with Related Persons\nWe are a global company with operations in the U.S. and several foreign countries. Every year, we spend hundreds of\nmillions of dollars for goods and services purchased from third parties. Because of these wide-ranging activities, there\nmay be transactions, business arrangements, or relationships with businesses and other organizations in which one of\nour Directors, Executive Officers, nominees for Director, or beneficial owners of 5% or more of our common stock or their\nimmediate families, may also be a director, executive officer, owner, or investor, or have some other direct or indirect\nmaterial interest (“related parties”). Related party transactions have the potential to create actual or perceived\nconflicts of interest between Kimball Electronics and our Directors, Executive Officers, nominees for Director, or\nbeneficial owners of 5% or more of our common stock or their immediate families.\nAccordingly, our Audit Committee has adopted a written policy governing the approval of related party transactions\nand the disclosure of such transactions when the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and a related party has a direct\nor indirect material interest. Any other circumstances that present potential conflicts of interest are to be reported to\nthe Chairperson of the NESG Committee and/or Company’s Chief Compliance Officer, either directly or through an\nanonymous reporting service. When reported, the transactions or other conflicts are reviewed by the Audit Committee\nand/or the NESG Committee, as appropriate, in consultation with the Board, and approved if in the best interests of our\nShare Owners to do so. In addition, on an annual basis, we require each Director and Executive Officer to complete\nDirector and Officer and Related Party Questionnaires that require disclosure of any transactions with Kimball\nElectronics in which the Director or Executive Officer or any member of their immediate family has an interest.\nThere were no such related party transactions or conflicts reported during fiscal year 2024.\n20\nOur People are the Company: Human Capital Management\nOur Purpose and Guiding Principles\nWe believe in creating quality for life. We believe our people are the company. We believe lasting relationships create\nour global success. We believe our people are our competitive edge for our service, quality, and value. Our people\nare the reason for our success.\nWe live by four Guiding Principles: customers, people, citizenship, and profits. We have a common understanding that\nour customer is our business, our people are the company, the environment is our home, and profits are the ultimate\nmeasure of our efficiency and effectiveness. We are relentlessly focused on achieving results based on service to our\ncustomer, developing our talent, and driving continuous improvement in all we do. Our unique company culture\nprovides the intangible structure for our people to achieve our goals, within the context of their strengths, in order to\nbuild our success. Our Guiding Principles provide a foundation for our decisions, processes, and philosophies. To learn\nmore about our Guiding Principles, visit our website at https://www.kimballelectronics.com/guiding-principles.\nFrom improving our customer scorecards to enhancing our recycling programs, our employees truly impact our\ncompany and communities through their spirit of innovation, mutual trust, integrity, and egoless execution of our\nstrategy. Together, we celebrate our successes, and we continuously improve by reflecting on our failures. We set the\nbar high, then provide the support, systems, and tools to enable our team members to exceed expectations of\nexcellence.\nWe have lasting relationships with our people. They enhance our culture and create our success. Our people are the\ncompany.\nSummary of Our Fiscal Year 2024 Highlights and Progress\nIn fiscal year 2024, we:\n• Achieved an above-target score on our Guiding Principles survey, our annual employee engagement\nmeasure. We also earned an above average net-promoter score, and had an 87% participation rate\nworldwide.\n• Participated in the McKinsey Women in the Workplace survey to analyze data, benchmark to our industry, and\ncreate action plans to continuously improve and remain an employer of choice for diverse populations.\n• Assessed performance and potential of over seven hundred employees, compared to over 500 employees in\nFY23, resulting from annual talent reviews giving visibility of aspirations, development needs and action planning\nfor talent management five levels removed from the CEO.\n• Formed two additional Employee Resource Groups (Veterans and Military Service Advocacy and PRIDE) to join\nour WISE: Women In Stem Empowerment group, each offering allyship, mentorship, and sponsorship programs\nand opportunities for underrepresented groups in our industry, including women, LGBTQIA+ employees, and\nveterans. We actively encourage and support our employees to create resource groups, and we provide\nfunding for their activities.\n21\nSuccession Management and Talent Risk Oversight\nOne of our Board’s principal duties is to manage our human capital strategies and policies, including reviewing\nmanagement succession planning for the development, retention, and replacement of executive officers, including\nthe CEO. Its responsibilities specifically include overseeing and monitoring the Company’s policies on growth and\ndevelopment, diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging; and total rewards through compensation and benefits.\nThe Board reviews its management succession and retention plans, including for our CEO, annually. Additionally, the\nBoard oversees the risks and exposures associated with management succession planning. Our Board believes that the\ndirectors and executive officers should collaborate on succession planning and that the entire Board should be\ninvolved in the critical aspects of the management succession planning process, including establishing selection\ncriteria that reflect our business strategies, identifying and developing internal candidates to ensure the continuity and\nenhancement of our culture, and making key management succession decisions.\nThe Board and the Talent, Culture, and Compensation Committee discuss management succession in regular meetings\nand in executive sessions throughout the year as appropriate. Directors can become familiar with potential successors\nfor key management positions through various means, including regular organizational strategy and talent reviews,\npresentations to the Board, and informal meetings.\nThe Board and management have made attracting, developing, and retaining the best people globally central to our\nstrategy because our people are crucial to our long-term, global success. We are focused on attracting, developing,\nand retaining best-in-class teams and continuing to build an inclusive culture.\nGrowth and Development\nWe have worked to build vitality and visibility in our talent pipeline. We work to develop talent to support our continued\ngrowth in our core competency of producing durable electronics and in our contract manufacturing services for non-\nelectronic components, medical disposables, drug delivery solutions and precision molded plastics. We continue to\nemphasize human-centered and purpose-driven philosophies and methodologies to create a workplace where our\npeople can be the best version of themselves so that we execute our business strategies and create impactful careers.\nWe continue to mature as a company by creating talent, systems, and new organizational structures to coordinate\npriorities and enhance collaboration.\nWe leverage the talent we bring into our organization through our future-focused, individualized performance\nmanagement practices. Our people deserve more than a rating, so we empower them to own and drive their\npersonal and professional development within the context of our overall business plan so that we meet real needs, not\nrules. We use accomplishments, aspirations, and challenges to qualitatively determine development needs. Our\nleaders are coaches who model our values, align expectations, and adapt to our people’s needs. With a commitment\nto the role they play in our success, our people make our Company whole.\nWe deeply care for our people, want to protect what is good about our culture, and are continuously improving the\nsense of importance and urgency around people development. We use a well-respected, evidence-based behavioral\nassessment tool known as the Predictive Index as a key data source about our leaders’ natural behavioral drives. We\ncomplement this evidence with managers’ observations of their people’s aspirations, motivations, cognitive agility, and\njob performance to gain insights to development gaps and impactful action planning. We augment these\nconversations with performance and succession management modules in Workday, our Human Resources Information\nSystem.\nOur Leadership Development strategy is to prepare our leaders by utilizing a structured, high-impact, culturally\ncongruent program based on our Leading, the Kimball Way capabilities:\n• Be a catalyst for growth\n• Have an enterprise mindset\n• Show courage\n• Build followership\n• Cultivate talent\n22\nThe design of our Leading, the Kimball Way journey is grounded in research about effective behavior change and\nleadership development. We start the journey by focusing on leading selves before transitioning to leading teams, and,\nfinally, leading at the enterprise. On this leadership development journey, we build capabilities of advocacy and\ninquiry in our leaders, especially as it relates to leading others. Our growth and development efforts aim to close\nidentified gaps in leadership capabilities required to execute our business strategy by designing leadership\ndevelopment that leverages face-to-face education, virtual learning, peer learning, mentoring, and developmental\nfeedback.\nWe train all our employees, our executive officers, our Directors, and our contingent workers annually and through\ntargeted, supplemental sessions throughout the year on our Code of Conduct, which outlines our ethics, human rights,\nlabor regulations, and anti-discrimination practices. We strive to have all our employees worldwide complete\ndiscrimination and harassment training on an annual basis. We annually audit both our compliance with this goal and\nour responses to issues raised to our global hotline (including those related to our Guiding Principles, Code of Conduct,\nSupplier Code of Conduct, ethics, bribery, and anti-corruption) and we report hotline activity to our Board of Directors\nand NESG Committee each quarter. Our annual core compliance curriculum also includes courses on Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act (FCPA), business ethics and essentials, and information security. We do not tolerate discrimination and\nharassment in our workplaces. As part of monitoring our compliance with our Guiding Principles and Code of Conduct,\nwe continue to prioritize responding to and remedying reports to our human resources teams and our global hotline,\naddressing a variety of issues through guidance, review, and/or investigation. To make them more accessible and\neasily understood, we have translated both the Guiding Principles and Code of Conduct into eight languages for\nemployees in each of the countries in which we operate.\nAt Kimball Electronics, we believe our organizational structure, information systems, and personal skills development\nmaximize our people’s flexibility to respond to our customers on their terms, as our consistently high Guiding Principles\nsurvey scores demonstrate. We are realizing the positive effects of the time, energy, and attention our leaders are\ndevoting to our People Strategy.\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging\nOur worldwide workforce includes approximately 7,000 people: approximately 1,200 employees in the United States\nand approximately 5,800 located across Europe, Asia, and Latin America. As our Guiding Principles say, we want\nemployees to share in their company's success, both financially and through personal growth and fulfillment. Our\npeople have built Kimball on the tradition of pride in craftsmanship, mutual trust, personal integrity, respect for dignity\nof the individual, a spirit of cooperation, and a sense of family and good humor. We seek to enhance this culture as we\ngrow, and we seek a diversified group of employees who can be committed to preserving and enhancing our values.\nWe value and work to promote a diverse, equitable, and inclusive work environment. We are committed to holding\nourselves accountable, to taking action to continuously improve our policies and practices, and to upholding the\nprinciples that encompass diversity, inclusion, equity, and belonging as outlined in our Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and\nBelonging (“DEI&B”) statement. Our strategy is to achieve excellence in customer service, employee relations, and\nbusiness objectives through creativity, responsiveness, and innovation resulting in increased well-being, a sense of\nbelonging, and meaningful work for our employees. We actively promote DEI&B, and incorporate DEI&B into our\nculture, values, and strategies. To identify opportunities to improve our recruiting efforts and enhance the inclusiveness\nof our workplace culture, we collect and regularly review with our leadership team various diversity statistics related to\ngender, ethnicity, age, military service, disability, and other attributes. We also provide an annual report on the diversity\nof our employees to the Board of Directors.\nAt Kimball Electronics, we define Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging as:\nDIVERSITY EQUITY INCLUSION BELONGING\nThe facts that illustrate The process and The behaviors that The emotions that result\nthe mix of human promise that each unlock the power of a from the behaviors,\ndifferences and employee has fair, diverse organization by processes and\nsimilarities in our impartial and equal ensuring individuals representation when\nworkplace and our access to opportunities can bring their whole perspectives,\ncommunities in which and advancement selves to work and experiences, and\nwe live and work. within the organization diverse skillsets, differences are valued\nregardless of their mindsets, and resulting in meaningful\ndiversity experiences are connection.\ndemographics. valued.\n23\nWe continue to execute on our commitment to DEI&B by striving toward the corporate goals we outline in our Global\nHuman Rights Policy on our website, including by increasing representation of underrepresented groups in the\ntechnology and manufacturing industries (Women, Black, Latino/a, Asian, Indigenous, Multiracial, LGBTQ, People with\nDisabilities, and Veterans) globally at the executive and senior management levels. Our diversity initiatives, overseen\nby management and our Board include targeted recruitment initiatives aimed at these underrepresented groups;\ntraining and guidance regarding diversity; and performing diversity reviews at different management levels and\nfacilities within the company. In fiscal year 2024, we created two additional Employee Resource Groups (Veterans and\nMilitary Service Advocacy and PRIDE) to join our WISE: Women In Stem Empowerment group, each offering allyship,\nmentorship, and sponsorship programs and opportunities for underrepresented groups in our industry, including\nwomen, LGBTQIA+ employees, and veterans. We actively encourage and support our employees to create resource\ngroups, and we provide funding for their activities.\nWe know our strength as an employer of choice is in a diverse and equitable talent pipeline, so we use an evidence-\nbased approach to focus our efforts on the attraction, retention, and promotion of the most qualified individuals. We\nactively seek highly qualified, diverse candidates (including diversity of experience and expertise) for consideration\nwhen we make recruitment and hiring decisions. We also:\n• Implement various software tools and platforms to increase inclusive language within our job postings,\nmarketing pieces, and total rewards branding to increase diversity in candidate pools and to access passive\ncandidates resulting in more diverse candidate slates; and\n• Hold leadership accountable for diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging outcomes.\nThese initiatives ensure that our leadership will reflect our organization and the communities in which we operate.\nWe are proud of our diversity: in the U.S., more than half of our workforce and executive management team is made\nup of underrepresented groups in the technology and manufacturing industries that we describe above. We have\nlong benefited from gender diversity on our Board, and women contribute to our business at the highest levels of senior\nleadership. In fact, each year since we became a public company in 2014, we have been recognized by 50/50\nWomen on Boards for having a Board comprised at least 20% of women. Three of our Independent Directors are\nfemale along with 50% of the Board’s leadership, 57% of our executive leadership team, and 33% of all management.\nOur global workforce is approximately 52% female.\nWe utilize contingent workers (including temporary workers and those employed by agencies or as independent\ncontractors) to augment staffing during peak business cycles and to fill certain open positions on a temporary basis\nwhen appropriate. However, our strategy is to limit the use of contingent labor and to convert contingent labor to\nregular employment. As of the end of fiscal year 2024, we had two contingent workers, one of whom was female.\n24\nBelow is a breakdown of our employee diversity, gender diversity by management level, and gender diversity by age\ngroup. Senior management includes managers who report to our CEO or at the second level away. Middle\nmanagement represents managers more than two reporting levels from our CEO.\nEmployee Diversity\n2200\n2000\n1800\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\nFemale Male Female Male Female Male\nUnder Under 30-49 30-49 50+ 50+\n30 30\nSenior Management Middle Management Non-Management\nGender Diversity by Management Level Gender Diversity by Age Group\nNon-management Under 30\nMiddle Manage...\n30-49\nSenior Managem...\nBoard of Directors 50+\n0% 50% 100% 0% 50% 100%\nFemale Male Female Male\n25\nIn the United States, 24% of our workforce is racially or ethnically diverse. Further, 4% of our US workforce self identifies as\nhaving a disability and 5% self-identifies as a veteran. To support our DEI&B objectives, we have an enterprise-wide\ntarget and expectation that 100% of the candidate slates for Board of Directors, executive, and director-level\nemployee positions include candidates from underrepresented groups. In the United States, for fiscal year 2024, hiring\nwas additive for African American, American Indian, and our Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander populations.\nAdditionally, hiring and promotion were additive to our and Hispanic and our Two or More Race populations in our\nUnited States workforce.\n100.00%\n80.00%\n60.00%\n40.00%\n20.00%\n0.00%\nAmerican Indian or Asian (Not Black or African Hispanic or Latino Native Hawaiian or Two or More Races White (Not\nAlaska Native (Not Hispanic or Latino) American (Not (United States of Other Pacific (Not Hispanic or Hispanic or Latino)\nHispanic or (United States of Hispanic or Latino) America) Islander (Not Latino) (United (United States of\nLatino)(United America) (United States of Hispanic or Latino) States of America) America)\nStates of America) America) (United States of\nAmerica)\n% of Hires % of Promotions % of Headcount\nTotal Rewards: Compensation and Benefits\nThe Kimball Electronics Total Rewards philosophy is built on the foundation of our Guiding Principles; specifically, we\nwant employees to share in their company’s success, both financially and through personal growth and fulfillment. We\nexpect and reward excellent performance of our teams around the globe. Our variable compensation structure allows\nflexibility in response to workforce fluctuations in addition to providing an incentive for our employees to earn\nincremental compensation dependent on roles, responsibilities, and results.\nOur compensation philosophy is to link potential and personal performance to base pay, and variable incentive pay to\nfinancial results and operational metrics. This philosophy is a core element of our Company’s culture. Under this\nphilosophy, we link base pay to performance, effort, market, and local demand. Increases in compensation are based\non continuous improvement and career development. We link the variable incentive portion of our pay to financial\nresults and operational metrics for each of our locations and across our enterprise. We believe these incentives drive\ncollaboration, cooperation, personal development, and continuous improvement that help us attain our financial and\noperational metrics within our priorities of focus.\n26\nTo support the long-term financial health of our workforce beyond their cash compensation, we also offer an\nimmediately vested company match for our retirement plan participants in the U.S., along with auto-enrollment in\ntarget date funds and annual automatic increases in deferral rates. As a public company, all of our employees\nglobally are eligible to purchase our common stock directly and, where permitted by law, through our retirement plan.\nOur best-in-class plan design results in consistent participant and plan health metrics at or above the benchmarks from\nour plan administrator, Vanguard. As of the end of fiscal year 2024, 91% of our eligible employees were participating in\nour 401k plan, well above Vanguard’s benchmark of 78% and above the participation rates of others in our industry.\nThis benefit supports our Guiding Principles that we want employees to share in their company's success, and that we\nembrace the attitudes of personal autonomy and empowerment.\nTo attract talent to execute our business goals, we conduct regular market studies in all the locations where we\noperate around the world. The total rewards package that we offer our employees in addition to their cash\ncompensation supports their financial health and personal wellness. However, deciding on an appropriate market\nvalue for the total rewards package can be complex and requires adequate data and informed judgment so that\neach global location’s benefits package is relevant and responsive to the local market. We have continued to\nincrease the quality and quantity of our benefits offered locally while maintaining cost effectiveness globally. To\nincrease transparency for our employees into the value of their total rewards package, our employees have access to\na self-service feature in our human resources information system that outlines for each of them the monetary value of\ntheir benefit elections, since those elections, and our resulting contributions toward them, complement cash\ncompensation. This feature provides a comprehensive view of the entire total rewards package each employee earns\nat our company. One of our People Guiding Principles is the importance of open, non-defensive communication, and\nthese elements of our benefit programs and how we communicate them to employees support this principle.\nHealth and Safety\nOur priority has always been the health and safety of our employees. Our Safety Management System, programs,\nemployee involvement, and training make us a safer place to work. Our goal is zero injuries, period. We are organized\nso that each facility location has safety, environmental, and facility (SEF) personnel from the workforce and leadership\nwho are responsible for implementation of best-in-class safety practices. Our practices focus on our employee health,\nsecurity, and emergency response and help us integrate a culture of safety and emergency preparedness, and it\nshows in our results.\nQualitatively, we work for continual improvement as we proactively reduce occupational injury and illness risks or\nhazards while promoting the health and well-being of our employees and our stakeholders. Our quantitative target is\nto maintain a total recordable incident and lost time injury rates globally that are less than half of the rates reported by\nthe U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses for our\nindustry. In 2022, the most recent data available from the BLS Survey, the total recordable incident rate for the “Printed\ncircuit assembly (electronic assembly) manufacturing” industry was 0.9 and the lost time injury rate was 0.4. Our\nstakeholder-focused, risk-based approach to continuous monitoring of employee health and safety has led to rates\nwell below those of both our industry and our quantitative targets, as we disclosed in our calendar year 2023 Guiding\nPrinciples Report.\nSafety Metric (1) CY2023 CY2022 CY2021 CY2020\nTotal Recordable Incident Rate 0.19 0.26 0.27 0.47\nLost Time Injury Rate (LTIR) 0.06 0.09 (2) N/A N/A\nNear Miss Frequency Rate 0.59 1.34 (2) N/A N/A\nWorkplace Fatalities 0 0 0 0\n(1) Incident rates are defined as the number of work-related injuries or illnesses serious enough to require treatment beyond first aid.\nLost time injury rates are defined as a work-related injuries or illnesses resulting in time away from work. Near miss injury rates are\ndefined as the number of incidents in which no personal injury occurred but could have but for a slight circumstantial shift. All\nrates are per 200,000 hours worked and are reported by calendar year. Our case rates include all of our operations, employees,\nand contingent workers globally. None of our contingent staff were injured in 2023. Additional detail is available in our calendar\nyear 2023 Guiding Principles Report available on our website at https://www.kimballelectronics.com/sustainability.\n(2) We first began tracking global aggregate statistics based on BLS definitions in these metrics in January 2022.\n27\nEach year, we strive to improve our safety metrics and maintain rates well below our industry’s average by ensuring\nregular communication and sharing of best practices among our SEF personnel through twice-monthly\nteleconferences and an annual face-to-face meeting that we hold at one of our global facilities. We conduct regular\nassessments to ensure that all facilities comply with our SEF standards and other applicable regulations. As our Guiding\nPrinciples remind us, offering ideas for improvements and new products is an opportunity we all share, and a\nresponsibility we must all accept. We continue to promote and reinforce an entrepreneurial spirit — a conviction that\ngrowth and continuous improvement is everyone’s job.\nStakeholder Engagement and Philanthropy\nOur Board and management team engage on a year-round basis with a range of stakeholders, including not only our\nShare Owners, but also our workforce, our vendors, our customers, and our communities. Our engagement program\nincludes maintaining formal global councils and task forces within our Company on subject matters including human\nresources and employee engagement; SEF; enterprise information security and cybersecurity; customer relationship\nmanagement, materials management; supplier quality; quality systems; digital processes; community engagement/\noutreach; and business planning. Each of our councils and task forces holds regular meetings either monthly or\nquarterly, throughout the year, and additionally as warranted, to collaborate and engage with their own internal and\nexternal stakeholders. They each report back to our executive team and our Board. Our global councils provide us a\nsystem to consult and engage with our internal and external stakeholders formally and to offer them ongoing\nopportunities to provide feedback in support of our sustainable growth.\nWe are members of the Responsible Minerals Initiative and we work closely with the Indiana Partners for Pollution\nPrevention and the Indiana Environmental Stewardship Program. We maintain a Supplier Code of Conduct based on\nthe Responsible Business Alliance’s industry standard that, together with our Global Human Rights Policy, embody a set\nof standards on social, environmental, governance, and ethical issues in supply chains. From company-wide events\nand giving opportunities to targeted ones like our legal department’s pro bono program, we give back to our\ncommunities and stakeholders in substantive and charitable ways. All of these steps help us meet our stakeholder\nneeds, regulatory requirements, and DEI&B goals; contribute to the prosperity and quality of life of our global\ncommunity; and deliver long-term, sustainable profits for our Share Owners.\nOne of our Guiding Principles is to strive to help our communities be great places to live. We live this Guiding Principle\nand further the goals of our Policy on Philanthropic Donations and Non-Commercial Sponsorships when we contribute\nand encourage our employees to contribute to our local communities. As we discussed in our calendar year 2023\nGuiding Principles report, we donated $310,304 worth of treasure, time, and talent (including over 3,300 hours of paid\nemployee time) to help worthy causes worldwide. We strive to donate up to 1% of our net income to worthy causes\nannually. For more information on our efforts, please see our latest Guiding Principles Report at\nwww.kimballelectronics.com/sustainability.\nMeasuring and Sharing How We Live Up to Our Guiding Principles\nWe work hard to mitigate turnover risk by consistently and formally surveying our workforce, including all full- and part-\ntime employees. We survey every employee each year about how well we are living up to our People Guiding\nPrinciples by asking them to anonymously rate us on a scale from 1 (low) to 10 (high). The survey results continue to\nshow that the vast majority of our employees would recommend KE to friends and family as a strong employer with\nwhich to seek a career. We have exceeded our target scores for the last ten years by earning over an 8.0 out of 10.0\noverall rating on our ultimate Guiding Principles measure.\n28\nWe conduct our Guiding Principles survey every year in the spring. After its completion, each local management team\nreceives qualitative and quantitative feedback and is responsible for crafting improvement plans based on our\npeople’s inputs. Also, we use the Predictive Index and Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i) tools to encourage building\nteams with diverse thoughts, tendencies, and expertise to strengthen outcome execution. We aim to assess our\nvendors, suppliers, and third-party partners to facilitate decision making about our own supply chain, prioritizing those\nsuppliers who mirror our own Guiding Principles and inclusion beliefs.\nWe continue to be leaders in sustainability and sustainability reporting, taking a proactive approach to measuring our\nprogress and transparently reporting our progress. Our objective is to provide stakeholders with high quality and\ncomprehensive environmental, social, and governance reporting on the material topics for stakeholders—our\ncustomers, employees, communities, investors, and suppliers. We published our new Guiding Principles Report this year\nfor calendar year 2023, including disclosures prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)\nStandards and GHG Protocol. The report is also aligned with the United Nations (UN) Sustainability Development Goals\n(SDG) and Global Compact (UNGC), the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Electronic Manufacturing\nServices & Original Design Manufacturing Standard, and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\nframework. The Guiding Principles Report builds on our demonstrated commitment to transparency and focuses on\nhow our business materially impacts people, the environment, and the economic well-being of our stakeholders.\nWe continue to monitor the evolution of frameworks and standard setters, such as the International Sustainability\nStandards Board, as we measure how we live up to our Guiding Principles. For our calendar year 2023 Guiding\nPrinciples Report, Kimball Electronics engaged an independent third party, Keramida, to perform a review\nengagement to obtain limited assurance on our disclosures presented in accordance with the GRI Standards and our\nScopes 1, 2, and 3 carbon emission disclosures presented in accordance with the GHG Protocol. You can find our\ncomprehensive annual disclosure of our sustainability performance, including our Guiding Principles Report and the\nresults of our Guiding Principles survey, on our website at https://www.kimballelectronics.com/sustainability.\n29\nPROPOSAL 2: SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC\nACCOUNTING FIRM\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, the member firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, and their respective affiliates\n(collectively the “Deloitte Entities”) audited the Company’s financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30,\n2024. The Deloitte Entities have been our independent auditor since our spin-off in 2014. As part of its auditor\nengagement process, the Audit Committee considers whether to rotate the independent audit firm because the Audit\nCommittee believes that it is important for the registered public accounting firm to maintain independence and\nobjectivity. As part of its engagement decision, the Committee determined there are significant benefits to having an\nindependent auditor with an extensive history with the Company, including:\n• Higher quality audit work due to the Deloitte Entities’ institutional knowledge of our global business, accounting\npolicies and practices, and our internal control framework; and\n• Operational efficiencies and resulting fee savings because of the Deloitte Entities’ history and familiarity with our\nbusiness.\nIn addition to the reasons discussed above, the Committee selected Deloitte based on:\n• Performance on past audits, including the expertise of the engagement team;\n• Experience, client service, and responsiveness;\n• Leadership, management structure, and ethical culture; and\n• Fees charged in relation to the scope of work performed.\nRepresentatives of the Deloitte Entities will be present at the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a\nstatement, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.\nIndependent Registered Public Accounting Firm Fees\nDeloitte Entities\n2024 2023\nAudit Fees(a) $ 1,482,258 $ 1,282,592\nAudit-Related Fees(b) — 6,407\nTax Fees(c) 95,709 37,071\nAll Other Fees(d) 1,895 1,895\nTotal $ 1,579,862 $ 1,327,965\n(a) Audit fees include fees and out of pocket expenses paid or expected to be paid for the audit of the annual financial\nstatements, the review of consolidated financial statements included in our quarterly Form 10-Q reports, the audit of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, and the services that an independent auditor would customarily provide in connection with\nsubsidiary audits, statutory requirements, regulatory filings, and similar engagements for the fiscal year.\n(b) Audit-related fees consist primarily of fees paid or expected to be paid for an income tax benefit compliance audit.\n(c) Tax Fees consist of fees paid or expected to be paid for tax compliance and related tax services.\n(d) All Other Fees consist of fees paid for an accounting research tool.\nConsideration of Services Provided by the Independent Registered Public\nAccounting Firm\nThe Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent\nregistered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has established a pre-approval process for services provided\nby the independent registered public accounting firm that complies with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\nof 2002. A description of the pre-approval process is attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix A. The Audit\nCommittee has considered whether all services provided are compatible with maintaining the independent registered\npublic accounting firm’s independence in accordance with this process and has determined that such services are\ncompatible.\n30\nREPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE\nThe Audit Committee of the Board is responsible for providing independent, objective oversight of the Company’s\naccounting functions, internal control over financial reporting, and financial reporting processes. During the fiscal year\nended June 30, 2024, the Audit Committee was comprised of at least three directors as required per the Audit\nCommittee Charter. All members of the Audit Committee meet the independence and experience requirements of\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and are considered audit\ncommittee financial experts under SEC rules.\nManagement is responsible for the Company’s accounting functions, internal control over financial reporting, and\nfinancial reporting processes. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP\n(“Deloitte”), is responsible for auditing and expressing an opinion in accordance with auditing standards of the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) on the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements.\nIn connection with these responsibilities, the Audit Committee met with management and Deloitte to review and\ndiscuss the June 30, 2024 financial statements, including a discussion of the acceptability and quality of the\naccounting principles, the reasonableness of critical accounting policies, the clarity of disclosures in the financial\nstatements, and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Committee under standards\nestablished by the SEC and the PCAOB. The Audit Committee also has received the written disclosures and a letter\nfrom Deloitte in accordance with the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding Deloitte’s communications with\nthe Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with Deloitte its independence from the\nCompany and management. In addition, the Audit Committee considered whether Deloitte’s independence would\nbe jeopardized by providing non-audit services to the Company.\nThe Audit Committee reviewed the overall scope of the audits performed by the internal auditor and Deloitte. The\nAudit Committee met with the internal auditor and Deloitte, with and without management present, to discuss the\nresults of the audits of the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the overall quality of the Company’s\nfinancial reporting.\nIt is not the duty of the Audit Committee to perform audits or to determine that the Company’s financial statements\nare complete and accurate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; that is the\nresponsibility of management and Deloitte. Members of the Audit Committee rely without independent verification on\nthe information provided to them and on the representations made by management and Deloitte. Based on the Audit\nCommittee’s discussions with management and Deloitte, and the Audit Committee’s review of the representations of\nmanagement and Deloitte, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, that the\naudited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended June 30, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nRespectfully submitted,\nThe Audit Committee\nTom G. Vadaketh (Chairperson)\nGregory A. Thaxton\nGregory J. Lampert\nRatification of Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe Audit Committee has selected the Deloitte Entities to be the Company’s independent registered public\naccounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025.\nRatification is not required by law or our By-Laws. We are submitting the selection of the Deloitte Entities to our Share\nOwners for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the selection is not ratified, the Audit Committee will\nconsider whether it is appropriate to select another independent registered public accounting firm. Even if the\nselection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may select a different independent registered public\naccounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the\nCompany and our Share Owners.\nThe Board of Directors recommends that you vote “FOR”\nratification of the selection of the Deloitte Entities\nas the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm.\n31\nInformation About Our Executive Team\nKimball Electronics’ executive officers as of the date of this Proxy Statement are: Richard D.

Summary of Our Fiscal Year 2024 Performance and Executive Compensation\nProgram\nFY 2024 Business Highlights\n• Net sales totaled $1,714.5 million, the second highest year in the history of the Company\n• Adjusted operating income of $74.3 million, or 4.3% of net sales\n• Inventory reductions of $112 million, or 25%, year-over-year\n• Cash flow generated from operating activities of $73 million\nKey Aspects and Designs of the FY 2024 Executive Compensation Program\nTo achieve its executive compensation program objectives, The Talent, Culture, and Compensation Committee (the\n“Committee”) used the components of compensation set forth below for fiscal year 2024, including (i) an annual base\nsalary, (ii) short-term cash incentives through our Profit Sharing Incentive Bonus Plan, and (iii) long-term equity incentive\ncompensation awarded under our 2023 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2023 Plan”). The Committee regularly reviews all\ncomponents of the program to verify that each executive officer’s total compensation is consistent with the\nCommittee’s compensation philosophy and objectives, that its component mix and performance measures support\nthe execution of our strategy, and that it is reasonable and appropriate given the scope and complexity of each\nNEO’s role, their capabilities, and the prevailing market conditions for their services.\n34\nA substantial portion of our target total direct compensation for our executives is variable incentive compensation and\ntherefore at-risk: 81% for our CEO (19% short-term and 62% long-term) and 64% for our other NEOs (14% short-term and\n50% long-term) in fiscal year 2024. Base salary is the only fixed component of direct compensation. A summary of the\nkey aspects, designs, and actions appears in the table below.\nPerformance\n(2)\nComponent and CEO NEO Measure Performance\n(1) (1)\nRationale Proportion Proportion Components Period Characteristics 2024 Actions\nBase Salary Ongoing Fixed cash Adjusted base\nsalaries of Mr.\nAppropriate level of Korn, Ms.\nfixed compensation that Thomson, and Ms.\nwill promote executive Croom based on\nrecruitment and roles, market\nretention. considerations\nAnnual Short-Term Economic Profit One Year Performance- Above target\n(Cash) Incentives based cash payout of 45% of\nbase salary (111%\nVariable pay to for CEO)\nincentivize and awarded based\nrecognize performance on FY24\nin areas of short-term economic profit\nstrategic importance to of $7.584M\nlink compensation with\nour financial success.\nLong-Term (Equity) Performance Shares\nIncentives\nThree-year Three Years Cliff-vested Issued FY24-FY26\nProfitability performance grants to NEOs;\nEquity-based pay to\nAttainment shares\nincentivize and\n(operating Awarded FY22-\nrecognize performance\nincome vs. FY24 PSUs at\nin areas of long-term\nstrategic plan 99.4% of total\nstrategic importance,\ngoals) (49.4% for\npromote retention and\nprofitability\nstability, and align\nThree-year attainment, 50%\nexecutives with Share\nGrowth for growth\nOwners.\nAttainment (Our attainment)\n3-year Revenue\nCAGR vs. EMS\nindustry 3-year\nRevenue CAGR)\nRestricted Shares\nThree Years Incrementally Issued FY24-FY26\nvested grants to NEOs\nrestricted\nshares\n(1) Proportion represents the base salary, target annual incentive award, and grant date fair market value of long-term incentives\ngranted in fiscal year 2024 (with performance share grants measured at target).\n(2) Represents the average of all NEOs for fiscal year 2024, other than the CEO. Percentages are rounded.\n35\nII. Compensation Philosophy and Governance\nCompensation Philosophy\nKimball Electronics applies a consistent philosophy to compensation for all employees, including management. We link\nannual base salary to performance, contribution, leadership, market, and demand for talent. The variable incentive\nportion of pay is linked to financial results and operational metrics. We believe it is important to have a significant\nportion of our variable compensation at risk for our salaried employees, especially our executive officers. This\nincentivized structure drives collaboration, cooperation, personal development, and continuous improvement to\ncreate long-term Share Owner value by:\nBase salary is designed to reward annual achievements, demonstrated leadership abilities,\nRewarding and management effectiveness. All other elements of compensation focus on motivating the\nPerformance executive to grow sales, achieve superior financial results, and attain personal goals that are\naligned to our strategic plan.\nOur objective is to align the interests of the executives with our Share Owners by strongly\nAligning with Share linking both short-term and long-term compensation to Company financial performance.\nOwners’ Interest Improved Company performance leads to improved stock prices and increased Share Owner\nvalue.\nAttracting, Motivating\nOur objective is to attract, motivate, and retain our executives by using key elements of\nand Retaining\ncompensation that provide better opportunity for financial rewards when compared to other\nExecutive Talent\nsimilar professional opportunities.\nStrengthening\nCollaboration Our objective is to strengthen collaboration by allocating a portion of employees’\ncompensation as a variable incentive based on results achieved together as a team.\nCompensation Program Governance: How We Make Compensation Decisions\nThe Committee, which is responsible for overseeing the compensation program for all executive officers, plays a key\nrole in designing and administering the Company’s executive compensation program. All principal elements of\ncompensation paid to our executive officers are subject to approval by the Committee.\nKey considerations affecting the determination of executive compensation include:\nResponsibilities\nThe scope and breadth of the duties and level of responsibility undertaken.\nLeadership\nDemonstrated ability to lead an organization.\nPerformance\nConsistent, sustained financial and operating performance.\nDemonstrated capacity and aspiration to grow into more responsible leadership\nPotential\npositions.\nDevelopment and\nExecution of Strategy Record of developing strategic plans and delivering on them.\nPersonal Development\nDemonstrated willingness to learn and grow professional and leadership skills.\nPromotion of Company Demonstrated commitment to modeling of our Mission and Guiding Principles and\nCulture and Values ethical behavior.\nCompany Results\nDemonstrated teamwork and support of our goals and performance.\nComparison of executive compensation to industry or other relevant compensation\nMarket Reference\ndata.\nAttraction and Retention\nCompensation at appropriate levels to attract and retain talented executives.\n36\nThe Committee also regularly reviews principles of good governance and market pay best practices to monitor the\nCompany’s compensation process to ensure alignment to creating Share Owner value. To that end, we are\ncommitted to maintaining the following best practices:\nWhat We Do What We Don’t Do\nü Promote a long-term focus through multi-year vesting û Apply rigid categorical methodologies or formulas in\nand performance requirements. setting the components, level, and mix of executive\ncompensation.\nü Provide a long-term incentive program for executive û Offer uncapped cash or equity incentive plans.\nofficers comprised primarily of performance-based\nequity.\nü Include minimum and maximum thresholds for long- û Enter into long-term employment agreements with\nterm incentive payouts, so executive officers have executives.\nboth upside and downside opportunities.\nü Maintain a robust director and executive stock û Provide “single trigger” change-in-control provisions.\nownership policy that helps align the interests of our\nShare Owners with our directors and executive\nofficers.\nü Require executives to retain 100% of all net shares û Offer tax gross ups on perquisites or severance for\n(post-tax) that vest until achieving their stock executives.\nownership requirements.\nü Review the metrics for our cash and equity awards û Guarantee cash or equity bonuses or salary\nannually. increases.\nü Include a metric in our performance-based equity û Allow any short sales, pledging, hedging, or trading in\nawards based on performance relative to our derivatives of our securities.\nindustry to reward significant positive\noutperformance.\nü Deliver short and long-term awards based on clear û Maintain evergreen equity plans.\nformulas.\nü Utilize a third-party compensation consultant to û Reprice or replace underwater equity awards.\nadvise on market, peer, and best practices for\nexecutive compensation.\nü Maintain a strong clawback policy to ensure û Issue equity awards at below-market exercise rates.\naccountability.\nü Require a minimum one-year vesting period for û Pay dividends on unvested stock awards.\nperformance shares and restricted stock granted\nunder our stock plan.\nRole of the Talent, Culture, and Compensation Committee and of the CEO\nThe Committee sets the CEO’s compensation and approves the compensation of the other executive officers in\nconsultation with the CEO, who directly supervises those executive officers throughout the year. The Committee gives\nsignificant consideration to the recommendation of the CEO, but the final compensation decisions affecting our\nexecutive officers are within the Committee’s purview. No other roles are taken by the executive officers in setting their\ncompensation, except for discussion of their individual performance with the CEO and Vice President, Human\nResources. The Committee uses competitive information as one of multiple reference points to inform its decisions\nabout overall compensation opportunities and specific compensation elements, generally targeting at least the 25th\npercentile for total target direct compensation levels. When appropriate, the Committee also takes into consideration\nthe accounting and tax treatment of the compensation and benefit arrangements for our NEOs.\nWe set individual performance goals for each executive at the start of the fiscal year. In addition, we provide\nexecutives with feedback related to their leadership and results execution through the annual talent review and\nperformance management process, which results in a personal development plan reviewed and approved by the\nCEO and Vice President, Human Resources.\n37\nConsistent with our performance-driven compensation philosophy, the Committee allocates a significant portion of our\nNEOs’ total compensation to variable, at-risk pay elements (performance-based short- and long-term awards). Our\nexecutive compensation program uses the same compensation components for each of our executives but assigns\ndifferent pay levels due to differing market compensation levels for similar roles. Nonetheless, our compensation\nprogram is also designed with internal pay equity in mind so that compensation opportunities are similar for executives\nwith comparable responsibilities, experience, and tenure.\nRole of the Independent Compensation Consultant\nDuring fiscal year 2024, the Committee used data from Aon, its third-party compensation consulting firm, in setting\nexecutive compensation. Aon was engaged directly by the Committee to advise on levels and components of\nexecutive compensation and peer incentive pay practices, and to consult on our peer group composition. The\nCommittee also uses full market compensation studies provided by Aon. The data from Aon included information on\nbase pay, stock awards, and other forms of compensation awarded at comparable companies. The Committee used\nthis data and recommendations from management as a reference point when making compensation decisions during\nfiscal year 2024 to ensure that the types and amounts of executive compensation were reasonable and competitive.\nCompensation-Related Actions for FY 2024 NEO Compensation\nThe Committee took the following actions on fiscal year 2024 NEO compensation during fiscal year 2023 and early\nfiscal year 2024:\nè è è è\nFebruary 2023 May 2023 June 2023 August 2023\nReviewed the Considered Approved 2023 Approved long-\npeer group and results of Share Kimball Electronics term performance\ndetermined to Owner advisory Equity Incentive and restricted share\nmaintain the vote on our Plan and grants for fiscal year\nsame peer executive recommended to 2024.\ngroup for fiscal compensation the Board that it\nyear 2024 as (Say on Pay) approve the plan Certified fiscal year\nused for fiscal from our annual and place it on the 2023 economic\nyear 2023. meeting.

The Committee selected the peer group using objective\ncriteria such as:\n• Company size and performance (revenue and operating margin);\n• Companies identified as specific competitors for executive and critical talent; and\n• Industry classification based on GICS industry sector, primarily those in the electronic components and\nelectronics manufacturing services industries.\nThe Committee uses competitive compensation data from an annual total compensation study for the executives at\nthe Company and the peer group companies to inform the Committee’s decisions about overall compensation\nopportunities and specific compensation elements. Additionally, the Committee reviews general industry\ncompensation survey data to supplement its review. The Committee does not benchmark specific compensation\nelements or total compensation to any specific percentile relative to the peer companies or the broader United States\nmarket. Instead, the Committee applies judgment and discretion in establishing targeted pay levels, taking into\naccount not only competitive market data, but also factors such as Company, business and individual performance,\nscope of responsibility, critical needs and skill sets, leadership potential and succession planning.\n38\nThe Committee conducts reviews of the peer group and selection criteria annually to ensure that both are\nappropriate. Based on its annual review, the Committee adopted the following peer group for comparing our fiscal\nyear 2024 compensation. At the time of our peer group review in February 2023, Kimball Electronics was in the 58th\npercentile for revenue and 29th percentile for market capitalization compared with the compensation peer group.\nPeer Group Used in Compensation Planning for Fiscal Year 2024\nCompany Stock Symbol\nBel Fuse Inc.

Accordingly, at our 2023 Annual Meeting, we held a non-binding,\nadvisory Share Owner vote to approve the compensation paid to our NEOs, commonly referred to as a say on pay\nvote. Share Owners overwhelmingly supported our executive compensation program, as reflected in our 2023 say on\npay vote, with over 98% of votes cast in favor of the proposal. The Committee and the Board determined that no\nchanges needed to be made to our executive compensation policies and procedures solely because of the 2023\nvote, and the Committee and the Board continued to apply the same general principles in determining the amounts\nand types of executive compensation for fiscal year 2024.\nIII. Fiscal Year 2024 Named Executive Officer Compensation\nWe awarded our NEOs the following compensation in fiscal year 2024:\nFiscal Year 2024 Base Salary\nThe Committee approved the base salaries for our NEOs, which the Committee believes will promote executive\nrecruitment and retention and are reasonable and appropriate given the scope and complexity of each NEO’s role,\ntheir respective capabilities, leadership, and performance, as well as the prevailing market conditions for their services.\nThe Committee’s approval included increases in Mr. Korn’s base salary of 4.4% and Ms. Thomson’s base salary of 28.3%\nthat reflect adjustments related to both the Committee’s consideration of factors above and their promotions to Chief\nOperating Officer from President, Global Electronics Manufacturing Services and to Chief Commercial Officer from\nVice President, Global Business Development and Design Services, respectively, each effective for fiscal year 2024. The\nCommittee also approved an increase in Ms. Croom’s base salary of 12.5%, an adjustment made to better align her\nsalary with the Committee’s consideration of the factors noted above. The Committee did not adjust Mr. Phillips’s base\nsalary for fiscal year 2024.\n39\nNamed Executive Officer FY2023 Base Salary FY2024 Base Salary % Increase\nRichard D.

The Committee sets a target\nannual incentive value for each NEO, which is their base salary multiplied by a percentage that can range from 0% to\n100% (200% for our CEO). We pay annual incentive awards based on our performance measured against pre-\nestablished financial goals, which can range from 0% to 100% (200% for our CEO) of base salary based on the\nachievement of Plan goals established by the Committee at the beginning of each fiscal year. The Committee ended\nthe individual personal performance bonus pilot program after fiscal year 2023.\nProfit Sharing Incentive Bonus Plan Framework\nOur NEOs, like all full-time salaried employees worldwide at Kimball Electronics, are eligible to participate in the Profit\nSharing Incentive Bonus Plan, which provides participants with an opportunity to receive a cash payment if we\nachieve certain profitability levels (tiers) for the fiscal year.\nThe goal of the Profit Sharing Incentive Bonus Plan is to link compensation with the long-term financial success of the\nCompany and Share Owner return. A key aspect of the Plan to accomplish this goal includes the fact that substantially\nall full-time salaried employees participate in the same bonus plan, which puts all management employees in the\nsame position to encourage growth of economic profit. Substantially all full-time salaried employees have some\nportion of their compensation “at-risk,” and the variable incentive portion of pay is linked to financial results. The\nvariable incentive can represent a significant part of a Plan participant’s total compensation, thus putting more\ncompensation at-risk and giving them greater incentive to improve economic profit and increase Share Owner value.\nThe higher our economic profits, the more we share with Plan participants. This links directly to our corporate goal of\nproviding exceptional long-term returns to our Share Owners and our Guiding Principle that we want employees to\nshare in our success.\nAt the beginning of each fiscal year, the Committee assigns a specific amount of economic profit to each tier.\nEconomic profit is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to the amount of net income less the cost of capital. The cost\nof capital represents the economic cost of a reasonable return on capital that is used in the business. New capital\nexpenditures are excluded in computing the cost of capital for an appropriate period of time (generally 3 years for\nmajor facility expansions and 12 months for all other) to encourage needed capital investments. We believe that\neconomic profit provides additional perspective to stakeholders about our performance, and in particular the profits\nwe generate over and above the cost of capital we use to do so.\nFor our NEOs, the Profit Sharing Incentive Bonus Plan measures economic profit for Company-wide performance. This\ndesign emphasizes the importance of our leaders working together as a team to deliver profitable growth on an\nenterprise level. The Profit Sharing Incentive Bonus Plan establishes potential cash incentive amounts as a range of\npercentages of the NEO’s salary, with the payout percentage increasing with higher levels of profitability. The Plan also\nestablishes different payout percentage ranges for participants like our NEOs who, by virtue of their responsibilities, are\nexpected to have a greater effect on the Company’s profitability. Our CEO followed by our other NEOs have the\ngreatest amounts at risk of any Profit Sharing Incentive Bonus Plan participants. As the achieved economic profit tier\nincreases, the NEO’s bonus potential increases along with the amount of their total take-home pay that is variable or\n“at risk” based on our profitability. The Plan is designed to share significantly more bonus at world-class (tier 1 economic\nprofit) performance levels, though its economic profit thresholds also ensure that the amount of each dollar of profit\nthat we share with NEOs is appropriately limited.\n40\nThe Committee sets the economic profit tiers at the beginning of each fiscal year after considering many factors,\nincluding comparisons to the economic performance of the cumulative TSR reference group that we identify in our\nForm 10-K. For participants to earn target annual incentive compensation, we must earn not only net income but also\nan economic profit. This provides an important link to Share Owner value: our NEOs share in a portion of the value we\ncreate for Share Owners only when we create such value. Accordingly, the Committee sets the threshold for tier 6 so\nthat net income is at or just above $0. Payouts are interpolated between each tier.\nProfit Sharing Incentive Bonus Plan: Target Opportunities for NEOs\nThe following table summarizes the Profit Sharing Incentive Bonus Plan’s cash incentive payout percentages at each\neconomic profit tier for our CEO and other NEOs; the associated economic profit threshold for each tier that the\nCommittee established for fiscal year 2024; and the threshold, target, and maximum opportunities for each NEO:\nEconomic Profit Threshold CEO (NEO) Bonus Payout\nPerformance Level Economic Profit Tiers (in thousands) as % of Base Salary\nMaximum 1 70,127 200% (100%)\n2 50,395 175% (80%)\n3 28,111 150% (60%)\nTarget 4 1,508 100% (40%)\n5 (12,705) 50% (20%)\nThreshold (Net Income: > $0) 6 (52,329) 0%\nAchievement of a tier 1 incentive payout for NEOs is very difficult because the Profit Sharing Incentive Bonus Plan is\ndesigned to pay maximum cash incentives only if we achieve economic profitability near the top decile of the public\ncompanies in the cumulative TSR reference group that we identify in our Form 10-K. The Committee approves the\neconomic profit tiers shortly after the commencement of each fiscal year, usually in late July or early August. The\nCommittee does not have the authority to increase, but can decrease, the amount of any cash incentive for NEOs\nunder the Profit Sharing Incentive Bonus Plan.\nCash incentives earned by our NEOs under the Profit Sharing Incentive Bonus Plan are earned and paid each August\nafter the end of the fiscal year, unless local law dictates otherwise.\nExcept for provisions relating to retirement, death, permanent disability, and certain other circumstances described in\na benefit plan, an NEO must be actively employed on each payment date to be eligible to earn and receive any\nunpaid installments. If an NEO’s termination of employment is caused by retirement, death, disability, or certain other\ncircumstances described in an applicable benefit plan, the NEO (or beneficiary, in the event of the NEO’s death) will\nbe entitled to receive all cash incentive payments for the previous fiscal year and a pro rata share for the current fiscal\nyear, all to be paid in full within 2½ months after the end of our fiscal year.\nFY2024 Annual (Cash) Incentive Outcomes\nIn July 2024, after the end of the fiscal year, the Committee certified the economic profit that we achieved in fiscal\nyear 2024 and approved the payment of the annual cash incentive. Our economic profit in fiscal year 2024 was\n$7,584,000, which fell between profit tiers 3 and 4, resulting in an above target payout to our CEO of 111% of base\nsalary and to our other NEOs of 45%. Final results were as follows:\nPhillips Croom Korn Thomson Hass\nMaximum FY2024 cash incentive (% of base salary) 200% 100% 100% 100% 100%\nTarget FY2024 cash incentive (%) 100% 40% 40% 40% 40%\nTotal Awarded FY2024 Profit Sharing incentive (%) 111% 45% 45% 45% 45%\nTotal Awarded FY2024 Profit Sharing incentive ($) $943,500 $202,500 $213,750 $173,250 $153,000\n41\nFiscal Year 2024 Long-Term (Equity) Incentives\nLong-Term (Equity) Incentive Design\nThe Company’s 2023 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2023 Plan”) permits a variety of stock incentive benefits consisting of\nrestricted stock, restricted share units, unrestricted share grants, incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options,\nstock appreciation rights, performance shares, and performance units. Under the 2023 Plan, no option or stock\nappreciation rights may be repriced, replaced, regranted through cancellation, repurchased for cash or other\nconsideration, or modified without Share Owner approval (except in connection with a change in our capitalization) if\nthe effect would be to reduce the exercise price for the shares underlying the award.\nLong-Term (Equity) Incentive Framework: Target Opportunities for NEOs\nThe Committee calculates each annual grant value opportunity as a percentage of base salary for the NEOs and uses\ncomparisons to pay levels of peer companies as a reference point to inform this equation. NEOs have no voting or\ndividend rights with respect to the shares granted until earned and awarded. We use the term “grant” to mean the\nnumber of shares that we have provided an employee the opportunity to earn, at target, if we attain our goals in a\nfuture performance period. We use the term “award” to mean the number of shares out of each grant that an\nemployee earns based on our attainment of our goals in a prior performance period.\nWhen it awards performance shares, the Committee uses a formula to determine the number of shares from each\ngrant the NEO would be eligible to earn after the three-year performance (vesting) period. The formula is a\ncombination of our profitability based on our operating income over the performance period as defined in our\noperating business plans for the applicable fiscal years ended June 30 (“Operating Income Goal”) and our growth\nbased on a comparison of our three-year Revenue CAGR to the EMS Industry’s three-year Revenue CAGR.\nThe Profitability Attainment represents 60% of the total cliff-vested award, and the Growth Attainment represents 40% of\nthe total cliff-vested award. The final percentages above are multiplied by those weights to reach the percentage of\nthe total grant that an NEO would be eligible to earn as an award. The Committee approves the Company’s three-\nyear strategic plan each year that contains the Operating Income Goal that serves as the denominator in the\nProfitability Attainment Percentage.\nThe Committee applies the following formulas:\nOperating income for the applicable fiscal years\nProfitability Attainment Percentage =\nOperating Income Plan\n42\nCompany’s 3-year CY Revenue CAGR\nGrowth Attainment Percentage =\nEMS 3-year CY Revenue CAGR\nFY2024 Long-Term (Equity) Incentives\nFor fiscal year 2024, the Committee granted approximately 80% of the long-term incentives in performance share units\nfor our CEO and 64% for our other NEOs, and 20% in restricted shares for our CEO and 36% for our other NEOs. The\nperformance share unit awards vest, if at all, on the third anniversary of the grant date (after fiscal year 2026). The\nrestricted shares vest in annual installments over the succeeding three-year period, subject to the NEO’s continued\nservice.\nType of Long-Term Proportion of Long- Rationale for Use of\nIncentive Vehicle Term Incentive Grant Vesting Schedules Metrics (Weighting) Incentive Vehicle\nPerformance Share Units 64% (80% for our CEO) Three-year cliff vesting 1) Profitability Attainment Ties a portion of long-\n(60%) term compensation\ndirectly to our\n2) Growth Attainment profitability and our\n(40%) performance relative to\nour industry.\nRestricted Shares 36% (20% for our CEO) 1/3 in three equal, Continuous Service by Aligns the interests of our\nannual installments the NEO (100%) NEOs with those of our\nShare Owners because\nthe value of RSUs\nincreases or decreases\nas the price of our stock\nchanges.\nThe Committee determined the number of shares to grant to each of our NEOs based on each NEO’s relative level of\nresponsibilities within an overall projected total cost of the awards based on anticipated financial performance for the\nupcoming fiscal year, as well as on other subjective factors noted above in this section.\nThe Committee also reviewed and approved the Company’s three-year operating plan for fiscal years 2024 through\n2026, including our three-year Operating Income Goal that serves as the denominator in the Profitability Attainment\nmeasure for performance shares. The Committee emphasizes profitability on an absolute basis in the Profitability\nAttainment Goal for performance shares and vests restricted shares over a long-term horizon to remain consistent with\nour Guiding Principle that Profits are the ultimate measure and to ensure that long-term incentive compensation retains\na strong link to Share Owner value: our employees share in a portion of the value we create for Share Owners only\nwhen we create such value. The Committee selected a relative measure for the performance shares’ Growth\nAttainment Goal to require us to outperform our industry for our NEOs to earn incentives above target.\n43\nLong Term Incentive Performance Periods\n(vesting events in blue)\nFY22 FY23 FY24 FY25 FY26\nFY22-24 PSUs Year 1 Year 2 Year 3\nFY23-25 PSUs Year 1 Year 2 Year 3\nFY24-26 PSUs Year 1 Year 2 Year 3\nThe three-year cliff vesting period for performance shares reinforced the focus of our NEOs on our long-term success,\nand the resulting value it delivers to our Share Owners, by further aligning their personal financial success with that long-\nterm success. In each case, the performance share grants set forth the number of shares of our stock that the\nparticipant was eligible to receive if we achieved the applicable profitability levels and sales growth goals for the fiscal\nyears covered by the grant.\nThe number of Performance Shares of our Common Stock that our NEOs may earn will be based on the Committee’s\nassessment after each applicable Performance Period of our goal attainment during that Performance Period.\nFY2024 Share Grants (All NEOs): FY2024-2026 Performance and Restricted Shares\nThe number of Restricted Shares and target number of Performance Shares granted to our NEOs under the 2023 Plan\nduring fiscal year 2024 for the fiscal year 2024-2026 performance periods are listed below. The Restricted Shares will\nvest, if at all, subject to the NEO’s continued service, in annual installments over the three-year period, beginning one\nyear after grant. The Performance Shares will vest, if at all, following the end of the applicable performance period with\nthe number of shares earned determined based on our performance against the profitability and growth goals set for\nthe applicable performance period, subject to minimums and maximums as described above. There is no minimum\nnumber of Performance Shares that an NEO may earn for the FY2024-2026 Performance Share grant, and the\nmaximum that an NEO may earn is 125% of the target number.\nFY2024-2026 Performance Period Grants\nPerformance Shares Restricted Shares\nTarget Opportunity Target Opportunity Granted (Target Granted (Number of\nNamed Executive Officer (% of Base Salary) ($) Number of Shares) (1) Shares) (1)\nRichard D.

In\nconjunction with his promotion to COO that was effective for fiscal year 2024 and the reorganized leadership and\nreporting structures his promotion created, the Committee in November 2023 granted Mr. Korn a COO Performance\nand Restricted Shares Grant (the “COO Grant”) of 35,033 performance shares and 23,356 restricted shares for a\nFY2024-2028 Performance Period. The restricted shares represent 40% of the COO Grant and will vest, if at all, in annual\ninstallments in years 3-5 of the Performance Period subject to Mr. Korn’s continued employment at the end of each of\nthose years. The remaining 60% of the COO Grant consists of Performance Shares of our Common Stock that Mr. Korn\nmay earn in years 3-5 of the Performance Period depending on his achievement of certain performance metrics\nrelated to his position and the development of a new leadership structure reporting to the COO position, as\nsummarized below:\nPerformance Period Performance Metric\n(assessment of achievement of metrics will determine payout between 0%-100%)\n• Identify current operations team member(s) currently reporting to COO for additional\nleadership development opportunities\nYear 3\n(FY26) • Identify operations team member(s) that demonstrate sufficient ability to present key\nbusiness objectives to executive leadership and Board\n• Identify operations team member(s)that demonstrate leadership of key project(s)\naccomplishing those key business objectives\n• Identify and establish appropriate leadership structure in light of new COO role,\ncomplexity and anticipated growth of the Company and its business units, and skills of\ndirect reports\nYear 4\n(FY27) • Complete assessments of individual leaders in new structure and identify coaching/\ndevelopment opportunities for those leaders to improve talent pipeline and business\ncontinuity\n• Establish rotation of leadership assignments based on new structure and individual\nleaders identified in Year 4\nYear 5 • Direct reports are rated as exceeding expectations in Leading, the Kimball Way\n(FY28) leadership development program\n• Identify additional candidates among direct and indirect reports for leadership\nassignments\nThe opportunity presented by the COO Grant is summarized below:\nMaximum Performance Shares Restricted Shares\nOpportunity Maximum Granted (Target Granted (Number of\nNamed Executive Officer (% of Base Salary) Opportunity ($) Number of Shares) (1) Shares) (1)\nSteven T.

The shares pay out based on specific, pre-established\nperformance goals tied to the creation of long-term value for our Share Owners. This award vested following fiscal year\n2024. Our three-year Revenue CAGR for our calendar years 2021 through 2023 was 14.30%. The EMS Industry’s three-\nyear Revenue CAGR for calendar years 2021 through 2023 was 3.72%.

He was not employed on the dates when the Company\ngranted performance shares for the FY22-24 period or when it granted restricted shares for vesting in FY23. Therefore, he was not\neligible to earn such shares.\n46\nFiscal Year 2024 Other Elements of Compensation\nOur executives are eligible for the same benefits that we make available to our other full-time employees. In the U.S.,\nthose benefits in which all full-time employees are eligible to participate include our 401(k) plan, health care plans, life\ninsurance plans, short- and long-term disability insurance, and other welfare benefit programs. As discussed below, our\nNEOs and certain others are eligible for our SERP to restore their retirement benefits to the same percentage level\nprovided to our salaried employees who are not limited by tax law restrictions. During fiscal year 2024, the Committee\ndid not award any other compensation to our NEOs.\n401(k) Retirement Plan\nOur NEOs participate in a defined contribution, participant-directed retirement plan in which all U.S. employees are\neligible to participate (the “401(k) Retirement Plan”). The 401(k) Retirement Plan is intended to attract employees and\npromote employee retention by providing a tax-favored, long-term savings opportunity. The 401(k) Retirement Plan\nprovides for voluntary employee contributions as well as a Company match of 50% of the first 6% of an employee’s\ncontributions and, if authorized by the Committee, a discretionary Employer Contribution. The Committee considers\nCompany profitability among other factors when determining the discretionary Employer Contribution for NEOs. We\nallocate any Employer Contribution based on the NEO’s eligible compensation, as defined by the 401(k) Retirement\nPlan.\nAll contributions, participant and Company, are fully vested immediately.\nThe 401(k) Retirement Plan is fully funded, and participants may choose to invest their balances among any\ncombination of available investment options.\nNonqualified Deferred Compensation\nBecause the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) limits the benefit value that may be contributed to and paid from a tax-\nqualified retirement plan, we also provide our NEOs, and other key employees deemed to be highly compensated\nunder the IRC with additional retirement benefits intended to restore amounts that would otherwise be payable under\nour tax-qualified retirement plans if the IRC did not have limits on includable compensation and maximum benefits.\nThese employees are eligible to participate in a fully funded, nonqualified, Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan\n(“SERP”) under which we contribute to the account of each participant an amount equal to the required reduction in\ntheir Company contribution under the 401(k) Retirement Plan. The object of the SERP is to restore total executive\nretirement benefits to the same percentage level provided to our salaried employees who are not limited by the IRC\nrestrictions.\nIn addition to Company contributions, participants may voluntarily defer up to 50% of their eligible compensation\nunder the SERP. A participant’s deferrals are fully vested. Company contributions vest immediately. For additional\ndetail, please refer to the compensation table titled “Nonqualified Deferred Compensation in Fiscal Year 2024.”\nNo Significant Executive-Only Benefits or Perquisites\nThe Company’s discretionary contribution to the 401(k) Retirement Plan for our NEOs made during fiscal year 2024 was\n4% of eligible compensation, up to the annual compensation limit under Section 401(a) of the IRC. The Company’s\ncontribution percentage to the SERP during fiscal year 2024 was 4% of eligible compensation in excess of the IRC’s\nannual compensation limit. During fiscal year 2024, we provided no executive-only personal benefits or perquisites to\nour NEOs.\nEmployment and Severance Arrangements\nWe do not have employment agreements with our NEOs; each of them is employed at will. However, we believe that it\nis appropriate to provide severance pay to an NEO when we involuntarily terminate the executive’s employment\nwithout “cause,” and in some cases when the executive voluntarily terminates their employment for “good\nreason” (each as defined in the Plan), to provide income replacement that will allow the executive to focus on our\nlong-term strategic priorities throughout their employment.\nAccordingly, all of our NEOs participate in the Kimball Electronics, Inc. Leadership Team Severance and Change in\nControl Plan (the “Severance Plan”).\n47\nThe Plan contains a “double trigger” arrangement for change in control benefits – i.e., severance benefits under these\narrangements are only triggered by a qualifying event that also results in the executive’s termination of employment\nunder certain specific circumstances within 24 months following the event. Likewise, unless the Board decides\notherwise, upon a change in control, the vesting of otherwise unvested equity awards will accelerate only upon the\noccurrence of a termination of employment in connection with the change in control. The Plan does not provide for\nany excise tax gross ups imposed as a result of severance or other payments deemed made in connection with a\nchange of control.\nSee the section Employment Agreements with NEOs and Potential Payments upon a Termination or Change-in-Control\nof this Proxy Statement, which describes the payments to which our NEOs may be entitled under the Severance Plan.\nIV. Additional Compensation Policies and Practices\nInsider Trading, Anti-Hedging, and Anti-Pledging Policy\nWe have adopted a policy prohibiting all Directors and executive officers, and any other employee designated as a\n“Covered Person” from time to time under our Corporate Governance Principles from pledging, hedging, or otherwise\nengaging in derivative or speculative transactions in our securities. Pledging includes holding our securities in a margin\naccount or otherwise pledging our securities as collateral for a loan. Hedging includes entering into short sales, options,\nputs, calls and sales against the box, as well as hedging of our securities, or derivative transactions including equity\nswaps, forwards, futures, collars and exchange funds. To our knowledge, none of our NEOs have engaged in pledging\nor hedging with respect to our Common Stock, and no pledge or hedge by any person of our Common Stock may at\na subsequent date result in a change in control of the Company.\nTiming of Equity Award Grants\nThe TCC Committee does not grant or otherwise authorize equity compensation in anticipation of the release of\nmaterial nonpublic information. Pursuant to the Board’s policy and procedures for granting equity-based awards, we\nmake grants and awards of our common stock after each fiscal year described above only after (1) a public\nannouncement of our earnings release for that fiscal year and (2) enough time has elapsed for the market to respond\nto that public announcement. Similarly, we do not time the release of material nonpublic information based on equity\naward grant dates.\nSection 409A\nSection 409A of the IRC affects the payments of certain types of deferred compensation to key employees and\nincludes requirements relating to when payments under such arrangements can be made, acceleration of benefits,\nand timing of elections under such arrangements. Failure to satisfy these requirements will generally lead to an\nacceleration of the timing for including deferred compensation in an employee’s income, as well as certain additional\ntaxes, penalties, and interest. We intend for, but do not currently require, our nonqualified deferred compensation\narrangement to meet the requirements of Section 409A.\nClawback Policy\nAccountability is fundamental to our Guiding Principles. To reinforce this fundamental value, we have adopted a\nstrong, “no fault” clawback policy providing that requires the Board to recover payments of incentive compensation if\nthe performance results leading to such payment are later subject to a downward adjustment or restatement of\nfinancial performance. The Board will require executives to reimburse or forfeit any portion of performance-based or\nincentive compensation paid or granted during the three (3) completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date\nof the restatement that is greater than the amount that would have been paid or granted if calculated based on the\nrestated financial results. Under this policy, the Board may use its judgment in determining the amount to be recovered\nwhere it cannot directly determine the amount to recover. The clawback policy also allows the Board to recover\nincentive compensation, whether vested or unvested, from any covered executive who is determined to have\nengaged in misconduct (meaning (i) a significant legal or compliance violation, including a violation of the\nCompany’s Code of Conduct or applicable laws; (ii) or an awareness of or willful blindness to the same in an area for\nwhich a covered executive had oversight authority; or (iii) “Cause” as defined in any Company equity incentive plan,\nincluding without limitation, the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan). A copy of the Executive Compensation Recovery\n(“Clawback”) Policy is included as an exhibit in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024 and\nin the Governance Documents section of our investor website at investors.kimballelectronics.com.\n48\nCOMPENSATION RELATED RISK ASSESSMENT\nThe Board believes that risks arising from our compensation policies and practices for our employees are not\nreasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, the TCC Committee believes that the\nmix and design of the elements of executive compensation provide our executives with financial incentives to\nincorporate appropriate risk management as part of our risk governance framework and do not encourage\nmanagement to assume excessive risks. With the assistance of the Company’s internal audit team, for fiscal year 2024,\nthe Committee extensively reviewed the elements of executive compensation to determine whether any portion of\nexecutive compensation encouraged excessive risk taking and concluded that the compensation program does not\nincentivize unnecessary or excessive risk taking. The base salary component of compensation does not encourage risk-\ntaking because it is a fixed amount. The short-term and long-term incentive plan awards have these risk-limiting\ncharacteristics:\n• Our compensation programs rely primarily on pre-established Company-wide operational and market-relative\nmetrics that apply equally to all executive officers to minimize the incentive to produce any particular\noutcome, to encourage a unified and responsible approach to achieving our goals, and to diversify the risk\nassociated with any single aspect of Company or executive performance;\n• Overlapping performance periods for incentive plan awards limit the impact of short-term business\nperformance or share price fluctuations on final plan outcomes;\n• We do not grant stock options, which may provide an asymmetrical incentive to take unnecessary or excessive\nrisks to increase the price of our common stock;\n• Members of our independent Committee approve all compensation targets, certification of target\nachievement, and authorization of payments to executive officers, and no executive officer participates in\ndeliberations about or approvals of their own compensation.\n• Cash and stock incentive awards are capped at a percentage of the target incentive award;\n• Equity awards are delivered in shares of Company common stock with multi-year vesting schedules or\nperformance periods, which align the interests of our executive officers to long-term Share Owner interests;\n• Incentive awards are subject to our clawback policy; and\n• Our robust equity ownership guidelines discourage excessive risk taking.\nFurthermore, as described under “Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Compensation Philosophy and\nGovernance,” compensation decisions are not purely formulaic and include subjective analysis by the Committee,\nwhich mitigates the influence of purely objective calculations on excessive risk taking. The TCC Committee reviews the\nCompany’s compensation policies and practices on an annual basis to consider how effectively the policies and\npractices are providing incentives at an appropriate level of risk to executive employees.\nREPORT OF THE TALENT, CULTURE, AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE\nThe Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management. Based on\nits review and discussions with management, the Committee recommended to our Board that the Compensation\nDiscussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference into our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for fiscal year 2024.\nRespectfully submitted,\nTalent, Culture, and Compensation Committee\nHolly A. Van Deursen (Chairperson)\nColleen C. Repplier\nGregory A. Thaxton\nThe foregoing Report shall not be “soliciting material” or deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing made\nby the Company under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, notwithstanding any general statement\ncontained in any such filing incorporating this Proxy Statement by reference, except to the extent the Company\nspecifically incorporates such Report by reference into such filing.\n49\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nNone of the TCC Committee members has ever been employed as an officer or employee of Kimball Electronics or\nany of its subsidiaries, and none of the Talent, Culture, and Compensation Committee members during fiscal year 2024\nwas involved in a relationship requiring disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation S-K. None of our executive officers\nserves, or during fiscal year 2024 served, on a board of directors or compensation committee of a company that has\nan executive officer serving on our Board or the Talent, Culture, and Compensation Committee.\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nWe believe in an incentive compensation system that applies to all employees, including management, based on the\nfundamental philosophies of rewarding performance, aligning with Share Owners’ interests by directly linking\ncompensation to financial performance, talent retention, and strong collaboration. As discussed in the Compensation\nDiscussion and Analysis, for our NEOs, the system includes three components: a base salary, performance-based cash\ncompensation, and performance- and service-based stock incentive compensation. We tie the majority of the\nincentive cash component to attainment of economic profit, which includes a cost of capital component, and link\nperformance-based stock compensation to operating income and sales growth components, both as compared to\nspecific goals.\nSummary Compensation Table\nThe Summary Compensation Table appearing below sets forth information regarding the compensation paid and/or\nawarded to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and the three other most highly compensated\nexecutive officers for or during the years ended June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

The balance also includes Company contributions in fiscal year 2024 and prior fiscal years, which are included in the “All\nOther Compensation” column of the Summary Compensation Table. As of June 30, 2024, all of our NEO’s are fully vested in the\nSERP plan.\nActivity disclosed in the table above relates solely to the SERP which is our only nonqualified deferred compensation\narrangement for NEOs. Payments of a participant’s elective deferrals and Company contributions are made as\nelected by the participant in lump sum or in installment payments over a period of 5 or 10 years commencing upon\nretirement or termination of employment, whichever occurs first. These amounts may be paid earlier in the event of\ndeath of the participant or an unforeseen emergency affecting the participant as determined by the committee\nappointed to administer the SERP. The SERP is intended to promote retention by providing a long-term savings\nopportunity on a tax-efficient basis. The assets of the SERP are held in a grantor trust, commonly referred to as a “rabbi\ntrust” arrangement. This means that the assets of the SERP are subject to the claims of our general creditors in the event\nof our insolvency.\n55\nEmployment Agreements with NEOs and Potential Payments Upon Termination or\nChange-In-Control\nOur NEOs do not have employment agreements. However, we believe that it is appropriate to provide severance pay\nto an NEO when we involuntarily terminate their employment without “cause,” and, in some cases, when the executive\nvoluntarily terminates their employment for “good reason” (each as defined in the Kimball Electronics, Inc. Leadership\nTeam Severance and Change in Control Plan (the “Severance Plan”)), to provide income replacement that will allow\nthe executive to focus on our long-term strategic priorities throughout their employment. We believe the level of\nseverance provided by the Plan is consistent with the practices of our compensation peer group and is necessary to\nattract and retain our key executives.\nEach of our NEOs are participants in the Severance Plan, which provides for severance upon a Qualifying Termination\nthat consists of salary continuation, health coverage, a cash bonus payout, outstanding equity vesting, and\noutplacement benefits. The amount of the benefits varies by the executive’s position and whether the severance is a\nresult of a termination due to a change in control, as that event is defined by the Severance Plan. Benefits under the\nSeverance Plan are subject to the NEO’s timely execution and non-revocation of a waiver and release of claims.\nSeverance Plan participants are required to comply with certain restrictive covenants and intellectual property\nassignment provisions, including obligations to uphold confidentiality, refrain from unfair and unlawful competition, and\nto abstain from soliciting our employees, customers, and clients for twelve months following a Qualifying Termination.\nExecutives are also generally bound by any similar agreement they previously executed. The Severance Plan does not\nprovide for any gross ups for excise taxes imposed as a result of severance or other payments deemed made in\nconnection with a change of control and contains a double trigger for such payments. The Severance Plan’s double-\ntrigger ensures the Company will become obligated to make change in control payments only if the executive is\nactually or constructively discharged as a result of the change in control.\nThe Severance Plan is an unfunded employee welfare plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of\n1974, as amended (“ERISA”) and is not a qualified plan under the IRC. As an unfunded plan, all benefits are paid out of\nthe general assets of the Company and no participant will have any greater claim to any asset than other general\ncreditors. We have not set aside or held any funds in trust to secure the benefits offered to participants under the\nSeverance Plan.\nThe following table and accompanying notes show the estimated payments and benefits that would have been\nprovided to each NEO pursuant to our Severance Plan. For eligible Participants, including each of our NEOs, the\nSeverance Plan generally provides for severance benefits in the event of a “Qualifying Termination” of the NEO’s\nemployment (as defined in the Severance Plan to include a termination without “Cause” or a resignation for “Good\nReason,” or a termination in connection with the consummation of a Change in Control). Pursuant to the Severance\nPlan, an NEO who incurs a Qualifying Termination would be entitled to receive severance payments equal to between\n6 months (for a Tier III Executive) and 12 months of their Base Salary (for our CEO, a Tier 1 Executive), a Bonus Amount\nequal to a percentage of the higher of their target cash incentive in the termination year or the average annual cash\nincentive for the previous three years prior to the termination year, reimbursement of up to $25,000 of outplacement\nservices, and, for eligible U.S. employees, a COBRA subsidy for a period of up to 12 months following a qualifying\nseparation. The amounts are doubled in the event of a Qualifying Termination during a Change in Control Protection\nPeriod, as those terms are defined in the Severance Plan.\n56\nThe amounts shown below assume that such termination would have been effective as of June 30, 2024, and thus\nincludes amounts earned through such time and estimates of the amounts that would have been paid to the NEOs\nupon their termination.

The amounts include severance, benefits allowance, and outplacement reimbursement. The Severance Plan does\nnot gross up benefits or reimburse participants for federal excise taxes on change-in-control payments or for tax liabilities due\nunder Section 409A of the IRC, if any.\n(2) Represents the value of unvested equity awards. In a change in control, the vesting would accelerate as a result of the\nspecified event of termination. Under a qualifying termination other than a change in control, vesting will be based on actual\nperformance pursuant to the terms of the equity awards and prorated based on the number of days worked during such\nperformance period. Equity awards are valued by multiplying $21.98, the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock as\nreported by Nasdaq on June 28, 2024, the last trading day of our fiscal year, by the number of unvested shares that would vest\nupon the specified event of termination.\n(3) An “Other Termination” is a termination of employment for any reason other than a Qualifying Termination under the Severance\nPlan, including, without limitation, termination of employment for Cause, retirement, death, or disability; or a voluntary\nresignation by the NEO.\nThe amounts shown in the table above do not include payments and benefits to the extent they are provided on a\nnon-discriminatory basis to salaried employees generally upon termination of employment. These include accrued\nsalary, health benefits, and distribution of account balances under the Retirement Plan. Also excluded from the table\nabove are amounts for payments of fully vested SERP contributions and balances, which can be found in the table in\nthe Executive Compensation — Nonqualified Deferred Compensation section in this Proxy Statement. As of June 30,\n2024, all of our NEOs were fully vested in the SERP plan.\n57\nCEO Pay Ratio\nIn accordance with Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-\nFrank Act”), and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K (“Item 402(u)”), we are providing the ratio of the annual total\ncompensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our median employee. This pay ratio is a reasonable\nestimate calculated based on the SEC rules and our payroll and employment records using the methodology\ndescribed below. In calculating the pay ratio, SEC rules allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, apply\ncertain exclusions, and make reasonable estimates and assumptions reflecting their unique employee populations.\nTherefore, our reported pay ratio may not be comparable to that reported by other companies due to differences in\nindustries, scope of international operations, business models and scale, as well as the different estimates, assumptions,\nand methodologies applied by other companies in calculating their respective pay ratios.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we employed approximately 7,000 employees worldwide that meet the definition of employee\nunder Item 402(u), other than our CEO.\nWe determined our median employee by reviewing the annualized base salaries as of June 30, 2024 of our considered\npopulation, which excludes our CEO, plus their target incentive compensation for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\nFor employees located outside the U.S., their compensation was converted to U.S. dollars using the spot exchange rate\nas of June 30, 2024. The median employee was determined to be a production operator employee located outside\nthe U.S. The total compensation of the median employee for fiscal year 2024 was $13,552. The average foreign\nexchange rate for fiscal year 2024 was used to convert the median employee’s actual fiscal year 2024 compensation\ninto U.S. dollars.\nThe total compensation of our CEO was $4,554,584 for fiscal year 2024, as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table\nfor Mr. Phillips. The ratio of our CEO’s total compensation to our median employee’s total compensation for fiscal year\n2024 was 336:1.\nThe CEO Pay Ratio was based on the fiscal year 2024 total compensation of our median employee, determined in the\nsame manner and using the same methodology used to determine the “Total Compensation” shown for our CEO in\nthe Summary Compensation Table. The elements included in the CEO’s total compensation are fully discussed above\nin the footnotes to the Summary Compensation Table.\nTo set some context for the above CEO pay ratio, as a large global manufacturing company, the nature of our\noperations relies significantly on employees outside the United States. Of the approximately 7,000 employees included\nin our analysis, approximately 80% are located outside the United States. The compensation elements and pay levels of\nour employees differ from country to country based on market trends as well as fluctuations in currency exchange\nrates. We regularly conduct competitive market pay analysis in all of the countries in which we operate in to ensure we\nare competitive with local market practices.\nPay versus Performance of our NEOs\nCompensation Actually Paid\nAs outlined in the CD&A above, the TCC Committee has implemented an executive compensation program that\nprioritizes performance and aims to align employee and Share Owner interests. The Pay vs. Performance disclosure\nbelow provides a snapshot of pay and performance alignment by evaluating the link between Compensation Actually\nPaid, as defined by the SEC (“CAP”), and measures of market and financial performance.\nThe following table sets forth additional compensation information for our principal executive officer (PEO) and our\nnon-PEO named executive officers (Non-PEO NEOs), calculated in accordance with Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, for\nfiscal years 2024, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\n58\nPay versus Performance Table\nSummary Compensation Compensation Actually\nTable Total Paid Value of Initial Fixed $100\nAverage Average\nSummary Compensation Peer Group\nCompensation Actually Paid Total Total Operating\nfor First for Second to First to Second Table Total for to Non-PEO Shareholder Shareholder Net Income\nPEO PEO PEO PEO Non-PEO NEOs NEOs Return Return Income Margin\nYear ($) (1) ($) (2) ($) (1) ($) (2) ($) (3) ($) (3) ($) (4) ($) (4) ($) (5) (6)\n2024 $ 4,554,584 $ — $ 2,455,879 $ — $ 1,555,462 $ 1,180,999 $ 162.33 $ 195.40 $ 20,511,000 2.9%\n2023 $ 4,293,775 $ 1,375,446 $ 4,697,655 $ 1,415,198 $ 1,070,088 $ 1,333,526 $ 204.06 $ 161.02 $ 55,831,000 4.8%\n2022 $ — $ 3,906,259 $ — $ 3,020,432 $ 991,889 $ 879,149 $ 148.45 $ 142.71 $ 31,253,000 3.9%\n2021 $ — $ 2,739,554 $ — $ 3,952,035 $ 869,216 $ 1,075,397 $ 160.56 $ 165.48 $ 56,791,000 5.1%\n(1) On March 1, 2023, Mr. Phillips (the “First PEO”) began his employment as our Chief Executive Officer.\n(2) On February 28, 2023, Mr. Charron (the “Second PEO”) retired from his position as our Chief Executive Officer.\n(3) During 2024, our remaining NEOs consisted of the following: Ms. Croom, Mr. Korn, Ms. Thomson, and Mr. Hass.

The 2014 Stock Option and Incentive Plan was\nreplaced in November 2023 and no additional grants can be made under that plan. The 2023 Equity Incentive Plan was approved by the\nCompany’s Share Owners in November 2023 and replaced the 2014 Stock Option and Incentive Plan. The number of performance shares and\ntotal shareholder return shares assumes the maximum number of shares that the participant is eligible to receive if applicable performance\nlevels are achieved. There is no evergreen feature under which the shares authorized for issuance under the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan may\nautomatically be replenished.\n(2) Consists of phantom stock units granted to non-employee directors under the Kimball Electronics, Inc. Non-Employee Directors Stock\nCompensation Deferral Plan (the “Deferral Plan”), which are participating securities and are payable in Common Stock upon a director’s\nretirement or termination from the Board or death. The Deferral Plan is a nonqualified plan approved by the Board of Directors on October 20,\n2016 that allows non-employee directors to defer all, or a portion of, their retainer fees in stock until retirement or termination from the Board or\ndeath. The Deferral Plan allows for issuance of up to 1.0 million shares of our Common Stock.\n(3) There is no exercise price for performance share awards, restricted share awards, total shareholder return share awards, or phantom stock units.\nPROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE ON THE COMPENSATION PAID TO OUR\nNAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nAs required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, and as a matter of good corporate governance, we are asking the\nowners of our Common Stock to approve the compensation paid to our NEOs, as disclosed pursuant to the\ncompensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables,\nand narrative discussion in this Proxy Statement. This proposal, commonly known as a say on pay proposal, gives our\nShare Owners the opportunity to express their views on our executive compensation. We currently hold an advisory say\non pay vote every year and anticipate that our next say on pay vote will occur in 2025, subject to the results of this\nyear’s advisory say on frequency vote discussed in Proposal 4 of this Proxy Statement.\nThe Compensation Discussion and Analysis in this Proxy Statement describes our executive compensation program and\nthe decisions made by the TCC Committee for fiscal year 2024 in more detail.\nWe maintain an open line of communication with our Share Owners on our compensation practices and have\nconsistently received high say-on-pay support from our Share Owners. At the 2023 Annual Meeting, 98% of the votes\ncast by Share Owners were cast “for” the approval of our NEOs’ compensation. In the last five years, say-on-pay results\nhave averaged 97.8% approval:\nSay on Pay Results\n2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Average\n97% 97% 99% 99% 98% 98%\nWe are asking our Share Owners to indicate their support for our NEOs’ compensation as described in this Proxy\nStatement. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation but rather the overall compensation\nof our NEOs and the philosophy, policies, and practices described in this Proxy Statement. Accordingly, we\nrecommend that our Share Owners vote “FOR” the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:\n“RESOLVED, that Share Owners of the Company’s Common Stock approve, on an advisory basis, the\ncompensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company’s Proxy Statement for the 2024\nAnnual Meeting of Share Owners, pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table, and the\nother related tables and disclosure.”\nAs an advisory vote, this proposal will not be binding on us or our Board of Directors or TCC Committee. However, we\nexpect that the Talent, Culture, and Compensation Committee, which is responsible for designing and administering\n62\nour executive compensation program, will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation\ndecisions for our NEOs.\nThe Board of Directors recommends that you vote “FOR”\nthe advisory proposal approving the compensation paid to our NEOs\nas disclosed in this Proxy Statement.\nPROPOSAL 4: ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF FUTURE ADVISORY\nVOTES ON THE COMPENSATION PAID TO OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE\nOFFICERS\nAs required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking the owners of our Common Stock to indicate how\nfrequently we should hold future advisory votes to approve the compensation of our NEOs. This non-binding advisory\nvote, commonly known as a say on frequency vote, gives our Share Owners the opportunity to indicate whether they\nwould prefer to have future advisory votes to approve executive compensation every year, two years, or three years,\nor to abstain from voting. We expect to hold another advisory say-on-frequency vote at our 2030 Annual Meeting.\nWhen Share Owners last voted on the frequency of the say-on-pay vote in 2018, the Board recommended an annual\nvote, which shareholders supported overwhelmingly. Our Board continues to believe that an annual non-binding\nadvisory vote on executive compensation remains the most appropriate option because (i) it would enable Share\nOwners to provide the Board with timely input regarding NEO compensation; and (ii) it is consistent with our practice of\nregular engagement with Share Owners to obtain their input on our corporate governance and executive\ncompensation philosophy, policies, and practices.\nShare Owners are not voting to approve or disapprove the Board’s recommendation. Rather, Share Owners may\nindicate their preferences on the frequency of advisory compensation votes by voting for one of the following options\nfor holding future advisory compensation votes:\n• every one year;\n• every two years; or\n• every three years.\nFor the reasons discussed above, the Board asks Share Owners to approve an advisory resolution to hold an advisory\nvote to approve NEO compensation every one year.\nAccordingly, we recommend that our Share Owners vote for a frequency of every “EVERY ONE YEAR” with respect to\nthe following resolution at the Annual Meeting:\n“RESOLVED, that Share Owners of the Company’s Common Stock approve, on an advisory basis, that the\nfrequency with which we should submit an advisory vote on the compensation of our Named Executive\nOfficers to Share Owners is: every one year, two years, or three years.”\nAs an advisory vote, this proposal will not be binding on us or our Board of Directors or TCC Committee. However, we\nexpect that the Talent, Culture, and Compensation Committee, which is responsible for designing and administering\nour executive compensation program, will consider the outcome of the vote when establishing its policy on the\nfrequency of holding future advisory votes to approve NEO compensation.\nThe Board of Directors recommends that you vote for the option of “EVERY ONE\nYEAR” for the frequency of future advisory votes to approve the compensation\npaid to our NEOs.\n63\nSHARE OWNERSHIP INFORMATION\nUnder the regulations of the SEC, persons who have power to vote or invest in or dispose of shares of the Company,\neither alone or jointly with others, are deemed to be beneficial holders of such shares. The total number of our shares\nlisted in the table for all executive officers and directors as a group is 507,267 shares of Common Stock (2.1% of the\noutstanding), as of the date noted below.\nSet forth in the following table are the beneficial holdings, as of September 9, 2024, of the Company’s Common Stock\non the basis described above for: (i) each person known to us who may be deemed to beneficially own more than 5%\nof our outstanding shares; (ii) each director; (iii) each “Named Executive Officer” (NEO) as listed in the Summary\nCompensation Table appearing elsewhere in this Proxy Statement; and (iv) all directors and executive officers as a\ngroup:\nShares Beneficially Percent of Outstanding\nName Owned(a)(b) Shares\nHolders of more than 5% of the Outstanding Shares\nDimensional Fund Advisors LP\nBuilding One\n6300 Bee Cave Road\nAustin, Texas 78746 2,054,359 (d) 8.3 %\nBlackRock, Inc.\n50 Hudson Yards\nNew York, New York 10001 2,507,732 (e) 10.1 %\nVanguard Group, Inc.\n100 Vanguard Blvd.\nMalvern, Pennsylvania 19355 1,827,565 (f) 7.4 %\nDirectors and Named Executive Officers:\nRichard D.

On September 9, 2024, there were 24,786,229 outstanding shares of\nCommon Stock.\n(b) The individuals listed are deemed to have sole voting and investment power over the shares owned by their respective spouses\nliving in their household. Beneficial ownership is disclaimed as to such shares and as to all other shares over which the named\nperson does not have full beneficial rights.\n(c) Totals are less than one percent of the outstanding shares.\n(d) This information is derived from the Schedule 13G/A filed by such Share Owner with the SEC on February 14, 2024, indicating\nbeneficial ownership as of December 29, 2023. The Share Owner reports that it has the sole power to vote or direct the vote of\n2,024,368 shares and the sole power to dispose or direct the disposition of 2,054,359 shares but also notes that it is an investment\nadvisor registered under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 and furnishes investment advice to four investment companies\nregistered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and serves as investment manager or sub-advisor to certain other\ncommingled funds, group trusts, and separate accounts (such investment companies, trusts and accounts, collectively referred\nto as the “Funds”). In certain cases, subsidiaries of Dimensional Fund Advisors LP may act as an advisor or sub-advisor to certain\n64\nFunds. In its role as investment advisor, sub-advisor and/or manager, Dimensional Fund Advisors LP or its subsidiaries (collectively,\n“Dimensional”) may possess voting and/or investment power over the securities of the Company that are owned by the Funds\nand may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the Company’s shares held by the Funds. However, all of the Company’s\nshares reported in this schedule are owned by the Funds. Dimensional disclaims beneficial ownership of such securities.\n(e) This information is derived from the Schedule 13G/A filed by such Share Owner with the SEC on August 7, 2024, indicating\nbeneficial ownership as of July 31, 2024. The Share Owner reports that it has the sole power to vote or direct the vote of\n2,403,637 shares and the sole power to dispose or direct the disposition of 2,507,732 shares but also notes that various persons\nhave the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the Company’s\nshares and that no one person’s interest in the Company’s shares is more than 5% of the total outstanding shares of the\nCompany.

Non-Employee Directors Stock Compensation Deferral\nPlan that may be distributable within 60 days following termination of Board service.\nShare Ownership Guidelines\nThe TCC Committee has established Share Ownership Guidelines for our directors, CEO, and executives reporting\ndirectly to the CEO. The Share Ownership Guidelines embody our Board’s belief that our senior leaders should maintain\na significant personal financial stake in Kimball Electronics to promote overall corporate responsibility, encourage\ndecisions focused on a long-term view, and serve the best interests of our Share Owners in creating long-term value\nthrough the value of our shares. In addition, the policy helps align Board, executive, and Share Owner interests, which\nreduces incentives for excessive short-term risk taking.\nUnder the Guidelines, each covered director or executive is required to maintain ownership of shares of our Common\nStock equal to either three times their annual cash retainer or base salary (for directors and for executives reporting\ndirectly to the CEO) or six times their base salary (for the CEO). Unearned, unvested, or unissued performance shares\nand unexercised stock options do not count toward the share ownership minimum. Each director and covered\nexecutive must retain 100% of all net shares (post-tax) that vest until achieving their minimum share ownership\nrequirement. Leaders have a reasonable time from their appointment (as determined by the TCC Committee) to\nattain their share ownership requirements, with a target of no longer than five years.\nDELINQUENT SECTION 16(A) REPORTS\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires that Company directors, executive officers, and greater-than-ten-percent\nShare Owners file with the SEC and the Company an initial statement of beneficial ownership and certain statements\nof changes in beneficial ownership of Common Stock of the Company. Based solely on its review of such forms\nreceived by the Company and written representation from the directors and executive officers that no other reports\nwere required, the Company is unaware of any instances of noncompliance or late compliance with such filings during\nthe fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\n65\nINFORMATION ABOUT THE 2024 ANNUAL MEETING\nLocation, Share Ownership, Quorum, and Voting\nQ: Where is the Annual Meeting?\nA: The 2024 Annual Meeting will be held at our principal offices, 1205 Kimball Boulevard, Jasper, Indiana, on Friday,\nNovember 15, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. EST.\nQ: Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting?\nA: The Board has set September 9, 2024 as the Record Date for the Annual Meeting. You are entitled to notice and to\nvote if you were a holder of record of Common Stock as of the close of business on September 9, 2024. Your shares\nmay be voted at the Annual Meeting only if you are present in person or your shares are represented by a valid proxy.\nBeneficial owners at the close of business on the Record Date have the right to direct their broker, trustee, or nominee\non how to vote their shares, as described below.\nQ: How many shares were outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting?\nA: As of the Record Date, there were 24,786,229 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to cast one vote for\neach share at the Annual Meeting. No shares of Kimball Electronics’ preferred stock were outstanding.\nOur list of Share Owners as of the Record Date will be available during the Annual Meeting for those Share Owners who\nchoose to attend. Company-appointed proxies will attend and be available at the Annual Meeting.\nQ: What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and as a beneficial owner?\nA: Shareholders of record. If your shares are registered directly in your name with Kimball Electronics’ transfer agent,\nBroadridge, you are considered the “shareholder of record” with respect to those shares. If you are a shareholder of\nrecord, Kimball Electronics sent these proxy materials directly to you.\nBeneficial owners. Most Kimball Electronics Share Owners hold their shares through a broker or other agent rather than\ndirectly in their own names. If your shares are held in a brokerage account or by a broker or other agent, you are\nconsidered the “beneficial owner” of shares held in “street name.” If you hold your shares in street name, these proxy\nmaterials have been forwarded to you by your broker or other agent. That entity is considered the shareholder of\nrecord with respect to those shares. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or other agent on\nhow to vote your shares. Since a beneficial owner is not the shareholder of record, you may not vote these shares in\nperson at the Annual Meeting without the control number on your Notice of Internet Availability, proxy card, or voting\ninstruction form, or in the email your broker or other agent sent you that contained this Proxy Statement. You may\ncontact your broker or other institution where you hold your account if you have questions about obtaining your\ncontrol number.\nQ: Why does the Company refer to Share Owners instead of shareholders or stockholders?\nA: We refer to our Share Owners because, consistent with our Guiding Principles’ long-term focus, we want to foster a\nculture where individuals and entities do not simply “hold” our Common Stock, but feel they own a tangible piece of\nour Company. Using the term “Share Owners” also reinforces our desire for alignment among our Directors, our\nexecutives, and our Share Owners. Together, we are not merely passive investors holding shares but rather owners with\na vested interest in the long-term success and direction of Kimball Electronics. As Share Owners, we encourage you to\ntake an active role in our corporate governance and decision-making processes.\nQ: How many shares must be present or represented by proxy to conduct business at the Annual Meeting?\nA: The presence of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is\nnecessary to constitute a quorum. Share Owners are counted as present if they attend the Annual Meeting in person or\nhave properly submitted a proxy. Abstentions and “broker non-votes” are counted as present and entitled to vote and\nare therefore included for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting.\nQ: What are “broker non-votes”?\nA: Generally, if shares are held in street name, the beneficial owner is entitled to give voting instructions to the broker or\nother agent holding the shares. If the beneficial owner does not provide voting instructions, the broker or other agent\ncan vote the shares with respect to matters that are considered “routine,” but not with respect to “non-routine”\nmatters, resulting in a “broker non-vote.” Accordingly, if you own shares through a broker or other agent, please be\nsure to give voting instructions so your vote will be counted on all proposals that come before the Annual Meeting.\n66\nThe ratification of the appointment of Deloitte Entities as our independent registered public accounting firm for the\nfiscal year ending June 30, 2025 (Proposal Two) is considered routine under applicable rules, so there should not be any\nbroker non-votes in connection with Proposal Two. The election of the directors listed in the accompanying Proxy\nStatement (Proposal One), the advisory vote on executive compensation (Proposal Three), and the advisory vote on\nthe frequency of say-on-pay votes on executive compensation (Proposal Four) are considered non-routine matters, so\nthere may be broker non-votes on Proposals One, Three, and Four.\nQ: How can I vote my shares during the Annual Meeting?\nA: Whether you hold shares in your name or in street name, you may vote before, in person at, or online during the\nAnnual Meeting. You will need to enter your control number (included in your Notice, your proxy card, or the voting\ninstructions that accompanied your proxy materials) to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting. Even if you plan to\nparticipate in the Annual Meeting, however, we encourage you to vote in advance over the Internet, by telephone, or\nby returning a proxy card if you have requested printed proxy materials. This will ensure that your vote will be counted if\nyou are unable to, or later decide not to, participate in the Annual Meeting.\nQ: How can I vote my shares without attending the Annual Meeting?\nA: If you are a shareholder of record, you may instruct the proxy holders how to vote your shares in one of three ways:\n• by using the internet voting site listed on the proxy card and Notice,\n• by calling the toll-free telephone number listed on the proxy card and Notice, or\n• by requesting a proxy card from Kimball Electronics by telephone at (812) 634-4000 or by mail at ATTN:\nSecretary, Kimball Electronics, 1205 Kimball Boulevard, Jasper, IN 47546, and completing, signing, dating, and\nreturning the proxy card in the postage pre-paid envelope provided.\nProxy cards submitted by mail must be received by the time the Annual Meeting begins in order for the related shares\nto be voted. If you return a signed proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, your shares will be voted as\nrecommended by the Board.\nSpecific instructions for using the telephone and internet voting systems are on the proxy card and Notice. The\ntelephone and internet voting systems for Share Owners of record will be available until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on\nNovember 14, 2024, the day before the Annual Meeting.\nIf you are a beneficial owner, you will receive instructions from your broker or other agent that you must follow in order\nto have your shares voted. These instructions will indicate if internet and telephone voting are available and, if so, how\nto access and use those methods.\nQ: What is the voting requirement to approve these proposals?\nA: You may vote “for,” “against,” or “abstain” on each of the proposals. The voting requirement to approve each\nproposal is listed in the Agenda Items and Board Recommendations section of this Proxy Statement.\nQ: What happens if I do not cast a vote?\nA: Shareholders of record. If you are a shareholder of record and you do not cast your vote, no votes will be cast on\nyour behalf on any of the items of business at the Annual Meeting.\nBeneficial owners. If you hold your shares in street name and you do not cast your vote, your broker, trustee, or\nnominee can use its discretion to vote on the ratification of the appointment of the Deloitte Entities as our independent\nregistered public accounting firm (Proposal Two). However, you must cast your vote if you want it to count in the\nelection of directors (Proposal One), the non-binding approval of compensation for our named executive officers\n(Proposal Three), or the non-binding approval of the frequency of the advisory vote on the compensation of our\nnamed executive officers (Proposal Four). Your broker may not vote your uninstructed shares with respect to Proposals\nOne, Three, and Four.\nQ: How does the Board recommend that I vote?\nA: The Board unanimously recommends that you vote your shares FOR the election of each of the nominees listed in\nProposal One, FOR the ratification of the appointment of the Deloitte Entities as Kimball Electronics’ independent\nregistered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of\nthe compensation of our named executive officers, and, on an advisory basis, the approval of “EVERY ONE YEAR” as\nthe frequency of the advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers.\n67\nQ: If I sign a proxy, how will it be voted?\nA: All shares entitled to vote and represented by properly executed proxy cards received prior to the Annual Meeting\nand not revoked before the polls are closed will be voted in accordance with the instructions on those proxy cards. If\nthere are no instructions on an otherwise properly executed proxy card, the shares represented by that proxy card will\nbe voted as recommended by the Board.\nQ: What happens if additional matters are presented at the Annual Meeting?\nA: If any other matters are properly presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting, including, among other things,\nconsideration of a motion to adjourn the Annual Meeting to another time or place (for the purpose of soliciting\nadditional proxies or otherwise), the persons named as proxies will have discretion to vote on those matters in\naccordance with their best judgment. We do not currently anticipate that any other matters will be raised at the\nAnnual Meeting.\nQ: Can I change or revoke my vote?\nA: If you are a shareholder of record, there are three ways you can change your vote.\n• Before your shares are voted at the Annual Meeting, you can file with Kimball Electronics’ Secretary a written\nnotice of revocation or a duly executed proxy card, in either case dated later than the proxy card you wish to\nchange.\n• You can attend the Annual Meeting and vote online with your control number. Simply attending the Annual\nMeeting without actually voting will not revoke a proxy.\n• If you voted online or by telephone, you may change that vote by voting again, either by making a timely and\nvalid internet or telephone vote or by voting online.\nAny written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy card should be delivered to the Kimball Electronics Secretary at\n1205 Kimball Boulevard, Jasper, IN 47546, and must be received by the Secretary before the vote at the Annual\nMeeting.\nIf you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, you can submit new voting instructions to your broker or\nother agent or you can attend the Annual Meeting and vote online with your control number.\nQ: Who will bear the costs of soliciting votes for the Annual Meeting?\nA: Kimball Electronics will bear all expenses of soliciting proxies, including the cost of preparing and mailing these proxy\nmaterials. Kimball Electronics may reimburse brokerage firms, custodians, nominees, fiduciaries, and other persons\nrepresenting beneficial owners of common stock for their reasonable expenses in forwarding solicitation material to\nsuch beneficial owners. Directors, officers, and other employees of Kimball Electronics also may solicit proxies in person,\nby telephone, by electronic mail, or by other means of communication. These individuals may be reimbursed for\nreasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with such solicitation but will not receive any additional\ncompensation.\nQ: Where can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting?\nA: We intend to announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting and expect to provide final results in a\nCurrent Report on Form 8-K within four business days of the Annual Meeting.\nAnnual Meeting Materials and Business\nQ: Why am I receiving these proxy materials?\nA: The Board is providing these proxy materials to you in connection with the solicitation of proxies for use at our 2024\nAnnual Meeting and any postponements or adjournments of that meeting. We first mailed these materials to all of our\nShare Owners on or about September 26, 2024 through a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the “Notice”)\nunless a Share Owner has specifically requested a full set paper copy of this Proxy Statement and our fiscal year 2024\nAnnual Report. This Proxy Statement, the form of the proxy card, and voting instructions are also being made available\nto Share Owners on or about September 26, 2024, at www.proxyvote.com. Our 2024 Annual Report is being made\navailable at the same time and by the same method. The 2024 Annual Report is not to be considered as part of the\nproxy solicitation materials or as having been incorporated by reference.\n68\nQ: What proposals will be voted on at the Annual Meeting?\nA: At the Annual Meeting, Share Owners will be asked to vote to:\nProposal 1:\nElect two Directors for a three-year term:\n• Gregory J. Lampert\n• Colleen C. Repplier\nProposal 2:\nRatify the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company’s Independent Registered Public\nAccounting Firm\nProposal 3:\nApprove, by a non-binding, advisory vote, the compensation paid to the Company’s Named\nExecutive Officers\nProposal 4:\nApprove, by a non-binding, advisory vote, the frequency of future advisory votes on the\ncompensation paid to the Company’s Named Executive Officers\nQ: Can I attend the Annual Meeting?\nA: Yes, if you are a Share Owner as of the Record Date! The 2024 Annual Meeting will be held in person at our principal\nexecutive offices located at 1205 Kimball Boulevard, Jasper, Indiana 47546. To be admitted to the Annual Meeting,\nyou must have the 16-digit Control Number found next to the label “Control Number” on your Notice of Internet\nAvailability, proxy card, or voting instruction form, or in the email sending you the Proxy Statement. If you are a\nbeneficial shareholder, you may contact the bank, broker, or other institution where you hold your account if you have\nquestions about obtaining your Control Number.\nQ: Why did I receive a Notice in the mail regarding the Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of a full set paper\ncopy of this Proxy Statement and fiscal year 2024 Annual Report?\nA: We are once again relying on an SEC rule that allows companies to furnish their proxy materials over the Internet\nrather than in paper form when Share Owners elect to allow us to do so. We encourage Share Owners to take\nadvantage of electronic delivery to help reduce the cost and environmental impact of the annual meeting! The\nNotice contains instructions on how to access our Proxy Statement and our 2024 Annual Report to Share Owners, which\nincludes our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 (our “2024 Annual\nReport”), and vote online. The Notice also contains instructions on how each of those Share Owners can request and\nreceive a paper copy of these materials and a proxy card.\nQ: Why did I receive a full set paper copy of this Proxy Statement in the mail and not a Notice Regarding the Internet\nAvailability of Proxy Materials?\nA: Share Owners who previously requested full paper copies of the proxy materials, or who have not requested\nelectronic delivery, are receiving paper copies again this year. Printed sets of proxy materials include a proxy, being\nsolicited on behalf of the Board, along with a return envelope that requires no postage if mailed in the United States. If\nyou would like to reduce the costs we incur in printing and mailing proxy materials, you can consent to receive all\nfuture proxy statements, proxy cards, and annual reports electronically via email or the Internet. To sign up for\nelectronic delivery, please follow the instructions provided on your proxy card or voting instruction form. Share Owners\nwho hold shares through a bank, brokerage firm, or other agent may sign up for electronic delivery by contacting that\nbroker or agent. We encourage Share Owners to take advantage of electronic delivery to help reduce the cost and\nenvironmental impact of the annual meeting!\nAdditional Information About the Proxy Materials\nQ: What should I do if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?\nA: You may receive more than one Proxy Statement, proxy card, voting instruction card, or Notice. For example, if you\nhold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you may receive a separate voting instruction card for each\naccount. If you are a shareholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you may receive\nmore than one proxy card. Please complete, sign, date, and return each proxy card or voting instruction card that you\nreceive to ensure that all your shares are voted.\n69\nQ: How may I obtain a separate Notice or a separate set of proxy materials and fiscal year 2024 Annual Report?\nA: If you share an address with another Share Owner, it is possible you will not each receive a separate Notice or a\nseparate copy of the proxy materials and fiscal year 2024 Annual Report. The SEC’s rules permit us to deliver a single\nNotice or set of proxy materials to one address shared by two or more of our Share Owners. This delivery method is\nreferred to as “householding” and can result in significant cost savings. To take advantage of this opportunity, we have\ndelivered only one Notice or set of proxy materials to multiple Share Owners who share an address, unless we received\ncontrary instructions from the impacted Share Owners prior to the mailing date. If you prefer to receive separate\ncopies of the Notice or proxy materials, contact Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. at (877) 830-4936, +1 (720) 378-5591\nfrom outside the United States, or in writing at Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., Householding Department, 51\nMercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717. If you are currently a Share Owner sharing an address with another Share\nOwner and wish to receive only one copy of future Notices or proxy materials for your household, please contact\nBroadridge at the above phone number or address.\nQ: What is the mailing address for your principal executive offices?\nA: Kimball Electronics’ principal executive offices are located at 1205 Kimball Boulevard, Jasper, Indiana 47546. Any\nwritten requests for additional information, additional copies of the proxy materials and fiscal year 2024 Annual Report,\nnotices of Share Owner proposals, recommendations for candidates to the Board, communications to the Board, or\nany other communications should be sent to this address.\nOur internet address is www.kimballelectronics.com. The information posted on our website is not incorporated into this\nProxy Statement.\nOTHER MATTERS\nThe Board of Directors knows of no other matters that may come up for action at the Annual Meeting. However, if any\nother matter properly comes before the meeting, the persons named in the proxy form will vote in accordance with\ntheir judgment on such matter using the discretionary authority granted in the proxy form.\nSubmission of Nominations and Proposals For 2025\nShare Owners who wish to submit proposals to be included in our Proxy Statement that we will issue in connection with\nthe 2025 Annual Meeting, except director nominations pursuant to our proxy access provision (which are subject to\nseparate requirements provided in the By-Laws), must ensure that we receive such proposals at our principal executive\noffices, 1205 Kimball Blvd., Jasper, Indiana 47546 addressed to Kimball Electronics’ Secretary, no later than May 29,\n2025. Such proposals must meet certain requirements under the regulations of the SEC to be included in our Proxy\nStatement.\nOur By-Laws set forth procedural and content requirements for director candidate nominations through proxy access.\nAs more specifically provided in the By-Laws, a Share Owner or group of up to twenty Share Owners owning 3 percent\nor more of our outstanding shares of common stock continuously for at least three years may nominate and include in\nour proxy materials director nominees constituting up to the greater of two individuals or 25 percent of the Board,\nprovided that the Share Owner(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements detailed in our By-Laws. Nominations\nshould be sent to our Secretary in accordance with the procedural and content requirements set forth in our By-Laws.\nA Share Owner wishing to nominate a candidate for election as a director or to bring any other proposal before the\n2025 Annual Meeting of Share Owners (but not include the nomination or proposal in our Proxy Statement) must cause\nwritten notice of the proposal to be received by our Secretary at our principal executive office no earlier than July 28,\n2025, and no later than August 17, 2025. The written notice must also meet additional requirements as stated in our By-\nLaws. Copies of our By-Laws are available at no charge upon written request directed to our Secretary.\nIn addition to satisfying the foregoing requirements, to comply with the universal proxy rules, Share Owners who intend\nto solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than Kimball Electronics’ nominees must provide notice that sets\nforth the information required by Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act no later than September 16, 2025.\nCommunication with the Board\nShare Owners may communicate with a member of the Board by sending comments in care of the Secretary of\nKimball Electronics at 1205 Kimball Blvd., Jasper, Indiana 47546. The Secretary has the discretion to forward the\ncorrespondence to the director, or if circumstances dictate, to other departments within the Company to which such\ncommunication is more appropriately addressed. A log of correspondence received and copies of the\n70\ncorrespondence are available to any director who wishes to review them. Communications relating to other topics,\nincluding those that are primarily commercial in nature, will not be forwarded. Concerns about accounting or auditing\nmatters or possible violations of our Code of Conduct should be reported under the procedures outlined in the\n“Reporting Violations” section of our Code of Conduct, which is available on our website at https://\nwww.kimballelectronics.com/code-of-conduct/.\n71\nAPPENDIX A: PRE-APPROVAL PROCESS FOR SERVICES PERFORMED BY THE\nINDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nObjective\nTo ensure the independent registered public accounting firm is independent in both fact and appearance with\nrespect to the audit of the financial statements of Kimball Electronics, Inc. (the “Company”).\nProcess\nThe independent registered public accounting firm of Kimball Electronics, Inc. reports to and is engaged by the Audit\nCommittee of the Company. The service and fees are pre-approved by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee\nwill not engage the independent registered public accounting firm for any non-audit service that is specifically\nprohibited by the Securities and Exchange Commission rules on auditor independence nor will approval be granted for\nany non-audit service that individually or in the aggregate, in the Audit Committee’s opinion, impairs the\nindependence of the independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the audit of the financial\nstatements of the Company.\nThe Audit Committee has delegated authority to the Audit Committee Chairperson to grant pre-approval required by\nthis policy for any service engagements that arise between Audit Committee meetings. During the next regularly\nscheduled Audit Committee meeting, or sooner as appropriate, the Audit Committee Chairperson updates the full\nCommittee of approved independent registered public accounting firm services for informational purposes.\nThe independent registered public accounting firm has reviewed the policy and believes that the policy will not\nadversely affect the firm’s independence.\nA-1"

Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBusiness Description:\nKimball Electronics, Inc. (also referred to herein as “Kimball Electronics,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a global, multifaceted manufacturing\nsolutions provider. We provide electronics manufacturing services (“EMS”), including engineering and supply chain support, to customers in the automotive,\nmedical, and industrial end markets. We deliver a package of value that begins with our core competency of producing durable electronics, and we further offer\ncontract manufacturing services for non-electronic components, medical disposables, and precision molded plastics. Our design and manufacturing expertise\ncoupled with robust processes and procedures help us ensure that we deliver the highest levels of quality, reliability, and service throughout the entire life cycle\nof our customers’ products. We deliver award-winning service across our highly integrated global footprint, which is enabled by our largely common operating\nsystem, procedures, and standardization. We are well recognized by customers and industry trade publications for our excellent quality, reliability, and\ninnovative service.\nBasis of Presentation:\nThe Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements presented herein reflect the consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024,\nresults of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash flows for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and share\nowners’ equity for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The financial data presented herein is unaudited and should be read in conjunction\nwith the annual Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024 and related notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K. As such, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted, although we believe that the disclosures are adequate to\nmake the information presented not misleading. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Management believes the financial statements\ninclude all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary to present fairly the financial statements for the interim periods.\nThe results of operations for the interim periods shown in this report are not necessarily indicative of results for any future interim period or for the entire fiscal\nyear.\nRevenue Recognition:\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with the standard issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers and all the related amendments. Our revenue from contracts with customers is generated primarily from manufacturing services provided for the\nproduction of electronic assemblies, components, medical devices, medical disposables, precision molded plastics, and automation, test, and inspection\nequipment built to customer’s specifications. Our customer agreements are generally not for a definitive term but continue for the relevant product’s life cycle.\nTypically, our customer agreements do not commit the customer to purchase our services until a purchase order is provided, which is generally short term in\nnature. Customer purchase orders primarily have a single performance obligation. Generally, the prices stated in the customer purchase orders are agreed upon\nprices for the manufactured product and do not vary over the term of the order, and therefore, the majority of our contracts do not contain variable\nconsideration. In limited circumstances, we may enter into a contract which contains minimum quantity thresholds to cover our capital costs, and we may offer\nour customer a rebate for specific volume thresholds or other incentives; in these cases, the rebates or incentives are accounted for as variable consideration.\nThe majority of our revenue is recognized over time as manufacturing services are performed as we manufacture a product to customer specifications with no\nalternative use and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. The remaining revenue for manufacturing services is\nrecognized when the customer obtains control of the product, typically either upon shipment or delivery of the product dependent on the terms of the contract,\nand the customer is able to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the asset. We generally recognize revenue over time\nusing costs based input methods, in which judgment is required to evaluate assumptions including anticipated margins to estimate the corresponding amount of\nrevenue to recognize. Costs used as a basis for estimating anticipated margins include material, direct and indirect labor, and appropriate applied overheads.\nAnticipated margins are determined based on historical or quoted customer pricing. Costs based input methods are considered a faithful depiction of our efforts\nand progress toward satisfying our performance obligations for manufacturing services and for which we believe we are entitled to payment for performance\ncompleted to date. The cumulative effect of revisions to estimates related to net contract revenues or costs are recorded in the period in which the revisions to\nestimates are identified and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.\n8\nWe have elected to account for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill our promise to transfer the associated\nservices and products. Accordingly, we record customer payments of shipping and handling costs as a component of net sales and classify such costs as a\ncomponent of cost of sales. We recognize sales net of applicable sales or value add taxes. Based on estimated product returns and price concessions, a reserve\nfor returns and allowances is recorded at the time revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of net revenue.\nDirect incremental costs to obtain and fulfill a contract are capitalized as a contract asset only if they are material, expected to be recovered, and are not\naccounted for in accordance with other guidance. Incidental items that are immaterial in the context of the contract are recognized as expense in the period\nincurred.\nTrade Accounts Receivable:\nThe Company’s trade accounts receivable are recorded per the terms of the agreement or sale, and accrued interest is recognized when earned. Our policy for\nestimating the allowance for credit losses on trade accounts receivable includes analysis of such items as aging, credit worthiness, payment history, and\nhistorical bad debt experience. Management uses these specific analyses in conjunction with an evaluation of the general economic and market conditions to\nestimate expected credit losses. Management believes that historical loss information generally provides a basis for its assessment of expected credit losses.\nTrade accounts receivable are written off after exhaustive collection efforts occur and the receivable is deemed uncollectible. Adjustments to the allowance for\ncredit losses are recorded in Selling and Administrative Expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.\nIn the ordinary course of business, customers periodically negotiate extended payment terms on trade accounts receivable. Customary terms require payment\nwithin 30 to 45 days, with any terms beyond 45 days being considered extended payment terms. We participate in our customers’ supply chain financing\narrangements for certain of our accounts receivables in order to extend terms for the customer without negatively impacting our cash flow. These arrangements\nin all cases do not contain recourse provisions which would obligate us in the event of our customers’ failure to pay. Receivables are considered sold when they\nare transferred beyond the reach of Kimball Electronics and its creditors, the purchaser has the right to pledge or exchange the receivables, and we have\nsurrendered control over the transferred receivables. In the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we sold, without recourse, $87.3 million and\n$103.0 million of accounts receivable, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, factoring fees were $0.5 million and $0.9\nmillion. Factoring fees are recorded in Non-operating income (expense), net on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. Prior to fiscal year 2025, factoring fees were recorded in Selling and Administrative Expenses.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, changes to the expected timing of payments from and risk of default for a customer resulted in the\nrecording of an allowance for credit losses of $2.0 million in Selling and Administrative Expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAlthough the customer is not in bankruptcy and we will continue to pursue full recovery, an allowance was deemed necessary in consideration of the expected\ntiming of payments and risk of default. The amount expected to be collected after twelve months is included in Other Assets, net on the Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheet. At September 30, 2024, the noncurrent receivable associated with this customer in Other Assets, net totaled $2.7 million, which is\nnet of the $2.0 million allowance for expected credit losses. The current portion of receivables from this customer is $2.2 million at September 30, 2024.\nNon-operating Income (Expense), net:\nNon-operating income (expense), net includes the impact of such items as foreign currency rate movements and related derivative gain or loss, fair value\nadjustments on supplemental employee retirement plan (“SERP”) investments, government subsidies, factoring fees, bank charges, and other miscellaneous\nnon-operating income and expense items that are not directly related to operations. Prior to fiscal year 2025, factoring fees were recorded in Selling and\nAdministrative Expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The gain (loss) on SERP investments is offset by a change in the SERP\nliability that is recognized in Selling and Administrative Expenses.\n9\nComponents of Non-operating income (expense), net:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30\n(Amounts in Thousands) 2024 2023\nForeign currency/derivative gain (loss) $ (1,034) $ (674)\nGain (loss) on SERP investments 345 (177)\nFactoring fees (537) —\nCredit facilities and bank fees (263) (201)\nOther (172) (79)\nNon-operating income (expense), net $ (1,661) $ (1,131)\nIncome Taxes:\nIn determining the quarterly provision for income taxes, we use an estimated annual effective tax rate which is based on expected annual income, statutory tax\nrates, and available tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Unusual or infrequently occurring items are separately\nrecognized in the quarter in which they occur.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities, recorded in Other Assets, net and Other long-term liabilities, respectively, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance\nSheets, are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of\nexisting assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. These assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable\nincome in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing\nthe likelihood of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not\nlikely, we provide a valuation allowance based on our best estimate of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions and the amount of deferred\ntaxes ultimately realizable. Future events could change management’s assessment.\nWe operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex uncertain tax positions,\nwhich may require an extended period of time to resolve. A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that\nthe tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We maintain a liability for uncertain\nincome tax and other tax positions, including accrued interest and penalties on those positions. As tax positions are effectively settled, the tax liability is\nadjusted accordingly. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in Provision for Income Taxes on the Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Income.\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform”) was enacted into law on December 22, 2017, making broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, for\nwhich complete guidance may have not yet been issued. Tax Reform, in addition to other changes, required a one-time transition tax on certain unremitted\nearnings of foreign subsidiaries that is payable over an eight-year period. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the remaining provision recorded for\nthe one-time deemed repatriation tax was $3.3 million and $5.9 million, respectively, payable through fiscal year 2026. As of September 30, 2024, the\nremaining deemed repatriation tax is short term and is recorded in Accrued expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNew Accounting Standards:\nNot Yet Adopted:\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance on Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, requiring\nadditional, more detailed information about a reportable segment. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and for interim\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued guidance on Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of\nincome tax disclosures. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating\nthe impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\n10\nNote 2. Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nOur revenue from contracts with customers is generated primarily from manufacturing services provided for the production of electronic assemblies, electronic\nand non-electronic components, medical devices, medical disposables, and precision molded plastics in automotive, medical, and industrial applications, to the\nspecifications and designs of our customers.\nThe following table disaggregates our revenue by end market vertical for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30\n(Amounts in Millions) 2024 2023\nVertical Markets:\nAutomotive $ 188.4 $ 212.5\nMedical 89.8 102.4\nIndustrial 96.1 123.2\nTotal net sales $ 374.3 $ 438.1\nFor both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 97% of our net sales were recognized over time as manufacturing services were\nperformed under a customer contract on a product with no alternative use and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. The\nremaining sales revenues were recognized at a point in time when the customer obtained control of the products.\nThe timing differences of revenue recognition, billings to our customers, and cash collections from our customers result in billed accounts receivable and\nunbilled accounts receivable. Contract assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets relate to unbilled accounts receivable and occur when revenue is\nrecognized over time as manufacturing services are provided and the billing to the customer has not yet occurred as of the balance sheet date, which are\ngenerally transferred to receivables in the next fiscal quarter due to the short-term nature of the manufacturing cycle. Contract assets were $74.3 million and\n$76.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively.\nThe Company may receive payments from customers in advance of the satisfaction of performance obligations primarily for material price variances, inventory\npurchases, tooling, or other miscellaneous services or costs. These payments are recognized as contract liabilities until the performance obligations are\ncompleted and are included in Advances from customers, if inventory related, and Accrued expenses, if not inventory related, on the Condensed Consolidated\nBalance Sheets, which amounted to $42.3 million and $43.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. Our performance obligations are\nshort term in nature and therefore our contract liabilities are all expected to be settled within twelve months. We also have deposits associated with inventory\npurchases classified as long term. See Note 5 - Inventories of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nNote 3. Sale of GES\nFollowing approval by our Board of Directors, on July 31, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement and closed on the sale of 100% of the equity interests\nin GES to Averna Test Systems, Inc., resulting in cash proceeds after costs to sell of $18.5 million, which is subject to additional purchase price adjustments.\nThe pre-tax gain recognized on the sale in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 was $1.3 million. In fiscal year 2024, following the Company’s decision to divest\nof GES, we classified the disposal group as held for sale and recognized $22.9 million in pre-tax impairment charges.\nThe following table summarizes net sales and income (loss) before taxes on income for the disposal group:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30\n(Amounts in Thousands) 2024 2023\nNet Sales $ 2,075 $ 10,285\nIncome (Loss) Before Taxes on Income (1) $ 985 $ (595)\n(1) Includes gain on sale of $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Each period also includes allocated corporate overhead expenses.\n11\nNote 4. Restructuring and Subsequent Event\nIn the three months ended September 30, 2024, we continued our restructuring efforts to align our cost structure with reduced end market demand levels,\nincluding resizing our workforce and taking specific cost actions, and recorded restructuring expense of $2.3 million which were primarily employee-related\ncosts. The cumulative amount incurred since inception of these efforts beginning in fiscal year 2024 through September 30, 2024 was $4.7 million. We expect\nto continue executing these previously announced restructuring efforts over the remainder of the fiscal year and estimate between $2.0 million and $3.0 million\nof additional pre-tax restructuring charges.\nIn addition, on November 4, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors has approved a plan to cease operations at our Tampa facility, expected\nto be completed by the end of the fiscal year. The decision was another important step towards sharpening our strategic focus, while leveraging our global\nfootprint and streamlining the operating structure. We expect to incur approximately $8.0 million to $11.0 million in total exit costs, including most\nsignificantly $6.0 million to $7.0 million in employee termination benefits and $2.0 million to $3.0 million in logistical costs to transfer and validate programs\nat our other facilities. We expect these costs to be predominantly cash expenditures, and a majority are anticipated to be incurred over the remainder of fiscal\nyear 2025. As the commitment to this disposal plan occurred subsequent to September 30, 2024, no charges have been incurred or recorded in the quarter.\nNote 5. Inventories\nInventories were valued using the lower of first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) cost and net realizable value. Inventory components were as follows:\n(Amounts in Thousands) September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024\nFinished products $ 192 $ 141\nWork-in-process — —\nRaw materials 335,080 337,975\nTotal inventory $ 335,272 $ 338,116\nAdditionally, as of September 30 and June 30, 2024, we have raw materials inventory totaling $43.1 million and $42.8 million, respectively, classified as long-\nterm included in Other Assets, net in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. This inventory is associated with a customer who is remediating a recall and\nwe do not expect the inventory to be consumed within the next twelve months. As of September 30 and June 30, 2024, we have received deposits totaling\n$42.0 million and $38.7 million, respectively, from this customer related to this inventory, which is included in Other long-term liabilities in our Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\n12\nNote 6. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the changes in the balances of each component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\n(Loss), net of tax, were as follows:\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nPost Employment\nForeign Currency Benefits Accumulated Other\nTranslation Derivative Gain Net Actuarial Gain Comprehensive\n(Amounts in Thousands) Adjustments (Loss) (Loss) Income (Loss)\nBalance at June 30, 2024 $ (14,260) $ (2,395) $ (1,152) $ (17,807)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications 6,951 (1,302) 71 5,720\nReclassification to (earnings) loss — 278 40 318\nNet current-period other comprehensive income (loss) 6,951 (1,024) 111 6,038\nBalance at September 30, 2024 $ (7,309) $ (3,419) $ (1,041) $ (11,769)\nBalance at June 30, 2023 $ (11,832) $ 1,368 $ (582) $ (11,046)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications (4,230) (309) 22 (4,517)\nReclassification to (earnings) loss — (2,213) (5) (2,218)\nNet current-period other comprehensive income (loss) (4,230) (2,522) 17 (6,735)\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ (16,062) $ (1,154) $ (565) $ (17,781)\nThe following reclassifications were made from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income:\nThree Months Ended\nReclassifications from Accumulated Other Comprehensive\nIncome (Loss) September 30\nAffected Line Item in the Condensed\n(Amounts in Thousands) 2024 2023 Consolidated Statements of Income\nDerivative gain (loss) (1) $ (384) $ 2,867 Cost of Sales\n106 (654) Benefit (Provision) for Income Taxes\n$ (278) $ 2,213 Net of Tax\nPostemployment Benefits:\nAmortization of actuarial gain (2) (53) 6 Non-operating income (expense), net\n13 (1) Benefit (Provision) for Income Taxes\n$ (40) $ 5 Net of Tax\nTotal reclassifications for the period $ (318) $ 2,218 Net of Tax\nAmounts in parentheses indicate reductions to income.\n(1) See Note 10 - Derivative Instruments of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on derivative instruments.\n(2) See Note 11 - Employee Benefit Plans of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on postemployment benefit plans.\nNote 7. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\nThe Company typically provides only assurance-type warranties for a limited time period, which cover workmanship and assures the product complies with\nspecifications provided by or agreed upon with the customer. We maintain a provision for limited warranty repair or replacement of products manufactured and\nsold, which has been established in specific manufacturing contract agreements. We estimate product warranty liability at the time of sale based on historical\nrepair or replacement cost trends in conjunction with the length of the warranty offered. Management refines the warranty liability regularly based on changes\nin historical cost trends and in certain cases where specific warranty issues become known. This product warranty liability and expense were immaterial during\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n13\nNote 8. Credit Facilities\nCredit facilities consisted of the following:\nAvailable Borrowings Outstanding Borrowings\nBorrowing Capacity at at Outstanding at\n(Amounts in Millions, in U.S Dollar Equivalents) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024\nPrimary credit facility (1) $ 63.1 $ 236.5 $ 285.5\nSecondary credit facility (2) 100.0 — —\nThailand overdraft credit facility (3) 10.1 — —\nChina revolving credit facility (3) 7.1 — —\nNetherlands revolving credit facility (3) 0.9 9.4 9.3\nPoland revolving credit facility (3) 5.6 — —\nTotal credit facilities $ 186.8 $ 245.9 $ 294.8\nLess: current portion $ (45.9) $ (59.8)\nLong-term debt under credit facilities, less current portion (4) $ 200.0 $ 235.0\n(1) The Company maintains a U.S. primary credit facility (the “primary credit facility”) among the Company, the lenders party thereto, and JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N. A., as Administrative Agent, and Bank of America, N.A., as Documentation Agent, scheduled to mature May 4, 2027. The primary credit facility\nprovides for $300 million in borrowings, with an option to increase the amount available for borrowing to $450 million upon request, subject to the consent\nof each lender participating in such increase. This facility is maintained for working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company. A commitment\nfee is payable on the unused portion of the credit facility at a rate that ranges from 10.0 to 25.0 basis points per annum as determined by the Company’s\nratio of consolidated total indebtedness to adjusted consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the primary credit facility. Types of borrowings available on the\nprimary credit facility include revolving loans, multi-currency term loans, and swingline loans.\nThe interest rate on borrowings is dependent on the type and currencies of borrowings and will be one of the following options:\n• any Term Benchmark borrowing denominated in U.S. Dollars will utilize the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), which is a rate per\nannum equal to the secured overnight financing rate for such business day published by the SOFR Administrator, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York, on the immediately succeeding business day, plus the Revolving Commitment Term Benchmark spread which can range from 100.0 to\n175.0 basis points based on the Company’s ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to adjusted consolidated EBITDA;\n• any Term Benchmark borrowing denominated in Euros will utilize the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) in effect two target days prior\nto the advance (adjusted upwards to reflect bank reserve costs) for such interest period as defined in the agreement, plus the Revolving\nCommitment Term Benchmark spread which can range from 100.0 to 175.0 basis points based on the Company’s ratio of consolidated total\nindebtedness to adjusted consolidated EBITDA; or\n• the Alternate Base Rate (“ABR”), which is defined as the highest of the fluctuating rate per annum equal to the higher of:\na. Prime Rate in the U.S. last quoted by the Wall Street Journal, and if this is ceased to be quoted, the highest bank prime loan rate or similar\nloan rate quoted by the Federal Reserve Board;\nb. 1/2 of 1% per annum above the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined under the primary credit facility); or\nc. 1% per annum above the Adjusted SOFR Rate (as defined under the primary credit facility);\nplus the Revolving Commitment ABR spread which can range from 0.0 to 75.0 basis points based on the Company’s ratio of consolidated total\nindebtedness to adjusted consolidated EBITDA.\nThe Company’s financial covenants under the primary credit facility require:\n• a ratio of consolidated total indebtedness minus unencumbered U.S. cash on hand in the United States in excess of $15 million to adjusted\nconsolidated EBITDA, determined as of the end of each of its fiscal quarters for the then most recently ended four fiscal quarters, to not be\ngreater than 3.0 to 1.0, provided, however, that for each fiscal quarter end during the four quarter period following a material permitted\nacquisition, as defined in the Credit Agreement, the Company will not permit this financial covenant to be greater than 3.5 to 1.0 for each such\nfiscal quarter end, and,\n14\n• an interest coverage ratio, defined as that ratio of consolidated EBITDA for such period to cash interest expense for such period, for any period of\nfour consecutive fiscal quarters, to not be less than 3.5 to 1.0.\nThe Company had $0.4 million in letters of credit contingently committed against the primary credit facility at both September 30, 2024 and June 30,\n2024.\n(2) The Company amended its 364-day multi-currency revolving credit facility agreement on January 5, 2024 (the “secondary credit facility”), which allows for\nborrowings up to $100.0 million, among the Company, as borrower, certain subsidiaries of the Company as guarantors, the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent and Bank of America, N.A., as Documentation Agent. The secondary credit facility has a maturity date of\nJanuary 3, 2025. The proceeds of the loans are to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company. A commitment fee on the\nunused portion of principal amount of this secondary credit facility is payable at 30.0 basis points per annum.\nThe interest rate on borrowings is dependent on the type of borrowings and will be one of the following options:\n• any Term Benchmark borrowing denominated in U.S. Dollars will utilize the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), which is a rate per\nannum equal to the secured overnight financing rate for such business day published by the SOFR Administrator, the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York, on the immediately succeeding business day, plus a Revolving Commitment Term Benchmark spread of 175.0 basis points;\n• any Term Benchmark borrowing denominated in Euros will utilize the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) in effect two target days prior\nto the advance (adjusted upwards to reflect bank reserve costs) for such interest period as defined in the agreement, plus a Revolving\nCommitment Term Benchmark spread of 175.0 basis points; or\n• the Alternate Base Rate (“ABR”), which is defined as the highest of the fluctuating rate per annum equal to the higher of:\na. Prime Rate in the U.S. last quoted by the Wall Street Journal, and if this is ceased to be quoted, the highest bank prime loan rate or similar\nloan rate quoted by the Federal Reserve Board;\nb. 1/2 of 1% per annum above the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined under the primary credit facility); or\nc. 1% per annum above the Adjusted SOFR Rate (as defined under the primary credit facility);\nplus a Revolving Commitment ABR spread of 75.0 basis points.\nThe Company’s financial covenants under this secondary credit facility are the same as the financial covenants for its primary credit facility.\n(3) The Company also maintains foreign credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes at specific foreign locations rather than utilizing\nfunding from intercompany sources. These foreign credit facilities can be canceled at any time by either the bank or us and generally include renewal\nclauses. Interest on borrowing under these facilities is charged at a rate as defined under the respective foreign credit facility. As a result of the GES\ndivestiture that occurred on July 31, 2024, the Company no longer has the Vietnam credit facility, which allowed for borrowings up to $5.0 million.\n(4) The amount of long-term debt under credit facilities, less current maturities, reflects the borrowings on the primary credit facility that the Company intends,\nand has the ability, to refinance for a period longer than twelve months. The primary credit facility matures on May 4, 2027.\nThe weighted-average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the credit facilities at both September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 were 6.8%.\nNote 9. Fair Value\nThe Company categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, whereas level 3 generally requires significant management judgment. The three levels are defined as\nfollows:\n• Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\n• Level 2: Observable inputs other than those included in level 1. For example, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or\nquoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets.\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting management’s own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.\nThere were no changes in the inputs or valuation techniques used to measure fair values during the three months ended September 30, 2024. For more\ninformation on inputs and fair valuation techniques used, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024.\n15\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements:\nAs of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the fair values of financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using the\nmarket approach are categorized as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Amounts in Thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Total\nAssets\nCash equivalents $ 17,431 $ — $ 17,431\nDerivatives: foreign exchange contracts $ — $ 916 $ 916\nTrading securities: mutual funds held in nonqualified SERP 5,780 — 5,780\nTotal assets at fair value $ 23,211 $ 916 $ 24,127\nLiabilities\nDerivatives: foreign exchange contracts $ — $ 4,313 $ 4,313\nTotal liabilities at fair value $ — $ 4,313 $ 4,313\nJune 30, 2024\n(Amounts in Thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Total\nAssets\nDerivatives: foreign exchange contracts $ — $ 1,420 $ 1,420\nTrading securities: mutual funds held in nonqualified SERP 5,445 — 5,445\nTotal assets at fair value $ 5,445 $ 1,420 $ 6,865\nLiabilities\nDerivatives: foreign exchange contracts $ — $ 2,485 $ 2,485\nTotal liabilities at fair value $ — $ 2,485 $ 2,485\nWe had no level 3 assets or liabilities at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, or any activity in Level 3 assets or liabilities during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nThe nonqualified supplemental employee retirement plan (“SERP”) assets consist primarily of equity funds, balanced funds, bond funds, and a money market\nfund. The SERP investment assets are offset by a SERP liability which represents the Company’s obligation to distribute SERP funds to participants. See Note\n11 - Employee Benefit Plans of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the SERP.\nFinancial Instruments Not Carried At Fair Value:\nFinancial instruments that are not reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value that have carrying amounts which approximate fair\nvalue include notes receivable and borrowings under credit facilities. There were no changes to the inputs and valuation techniques used to assess the fair value\nof these financial instruments during the three months ended September 30, 2024. For more information on inputs and fair valuation techniques used, refer to\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024.\nThe carrying values of our cash deposit accounts, trade accounts receivable, and trade accounts payable approximate fair value due to the relatively short\nmaturity and immaterial non-performance risk.\nNote 10. Derivative Instruments\nForeign Exchange Contracts:\nWe operate internationally and are therefore exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. Our primary means of\nmanaging this exposure is to utilize natural hedges, such as aligning currencies used in the supply chain with the sale currency. To the extent natural hedging\ntechniques do not fully offset currency risk, we use derivative instruments with the objective of reducing the residual exposure to certain foreign currency rate\nmovements. Factors considered in the decision to hedge an underlying market exposure include the materiality of the risk, the volatility of the market, the\nduration of the hedge, the degree to which the underlying exposure is committed to, and the availability, effectiveness, and cost of derivative instruments.\nDerivative instruments are only utilized for risk management purposes and are not used for speculative or trading purposes.\n16\nWe use forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in forecasted transactions\ndenominated in a foreign currency. Non-designated foreign exchange contracts are also used to hedge against foreign currency exchange rate risks related to\nintercompany balances and other balance sheet positions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies. As of September 30, 2024, we had\noutstanding foreign exchange contracts to hedge currencies against the U.S. dollar in the aggregate notional amount of $27.1 million and to hedge currencies\nagainst the Euro in the aggregate notional amount of 56.4 million Euro. The notional amounts are indicators of the volume of derivative activities but may not\nbe indicators of the potential gain or loss on the derivatives.\nIn limited cases due to unexpected changes in forecasted transactions, cash flow hedges may cease to meet the criteria to be designated as cash flow hedges.\nDepending on the type of exposure hedged, we may either purchase a derivative contract in the opposite position of the undesignated hedge or may retain the\nhedge until it matures if the hedge continues to provide an adequate offset in earnings against the currency revaluation impact of foreign currency denominated\nliabilities.\nThe fair value of outstanding derivative instruments is recognized on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as a derivative asset or liability and\npresented with Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Accrued expenses, respectively. When derivatives are settled with the counterparty, the derivative\nasset or liability is relieved and cash flow is impacted for the net settlement. For derivative instruments that meet the criteria of hedging instruments under\nFASB guidance, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is initially recorded net of related tax effect in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss),\na component of Share Owners’ Equity, and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period or periods during which the hedged transaction is recognized\nin earnings. The gain or loss associated with derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments or that cease to meet the criteria for hedging\nunder FASB guidance is reported immediately in Non-operating income (expense), net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.\nBased on fair values as of September 30, 2024, we estimate that approximately $2.9 million of pre-tax derivative loss deferred in Accumulated Other\nComprehensive Loss will be reclassified into earnings, along with the earnings effects of related forecasted transactions, within the next 12 months. Gains on\nforeign exchange contracts are generally offset by losses in operating income in the income statement when the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in\nearnings. Because gains or losses on foreign exchange contracts fluctuate partially based on currency spot rates, the future effect on earnings of the cash flow\nhedges alone is not determinable, but in conjunction with the underlying hedged transactions, the result is expected to be a decline in currency risk. The\nmaximum length of time we had hedged our exposure to the variability in future cash flows was 12 months as of both September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024.\nSee Note 9 - Fair Value of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the fair value of derivative assets and\nliabilities and Note 6 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the changes in\ndeferred derivative gains and losses.\n17\nInformation on the location and amounts of derivative fair values in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and derivative gains and losses in the\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Income are presented below.\nFair Value of Derivative Instruments on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\nAsset Derivatives Liability Derivatives\nFair Value As of Fair Value As of\nSeptember 30, June 30, September 30, June 30,\n(Amounts in Thousands) Balance Sheet Location 2024 2024 Balance Sheet Location 2024 2024\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments:\nPrepaid expenses and other\nForeign exchange contracts current assets $ 916 $ 966 Accrued expenses $ 3,621 $ 2,330\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:\nPrepaid expenses and other\nForeign exchange contracts current assets — 454 Accrued expenses 692 155\nTotal derivatives $ 916 $ 1,420 $ 4,313 $ 2,485\nThe Effect of Derivative Instruments on Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30\n(Amounts in Thousands) 2024 2023\nAmount of Pre-Tax Gain or (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (OCI) on Derivatives:\nForeign exchange contracts $ (1,747) $ (387)\nThe Effect of Derivative Instruments on Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income\nThree Months Ended\n(Amounts in Thousands) September 30\nDerivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships Location of Gain or (Loss) 2024 2023\nAmount of Pre-Tax Gain or (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated OCI into Income:\nForeign exchange contracts Cost of Sales $ (384) $ 2,867\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nAmount of Pre-Tax Gain or (Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivatives:\nForeign exchange contracts Non-operating income (expense) $ (1,545) $ 142\nTotal Derivative Pre-Tax Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income $ (1,929) $ 3,009\nNote 11. Employee Benefit Plans\nDefined Contribution Retirement Plan:\nThe Company maintains a trusteed defined contribution retirement plan which is in effect for substantially all domestic employees meeting the eligibility\nrequirements. The Company matches 50% of eligible employee contributions up to 6%. The Company also provides a discretionary contribution determined\nannually by the Talent, Culture, and Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. Total expense related to employer contributions to the\ndomestic retirement plans was $0.4 million and $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\nThe Company also maintains a supplemental employee retirement plan (“SERP”) for executives and other key employees which enables them to defer cash\ncompensation on a pre-tax basis and restore amounts that would otherwise be payable under our tax-qualified retirement plans if the IRS did not have limits on\nincludable compensation and maximum benefits. The SERP is structured as a rabbi trust, and therefore, assets in the SERP portfolio are subject to creditor\nclaims in the event of bankruptcy. We recognize SERP investment assets on the balance sheet at current fair value. A SERP liability of the same amount is\nrecorded on the balance sheet representing an obligation to distribute SERP funds to participants. As of September 30, 2024, both total investments and\nobligations under SERP were $5.8 million, of which $2.1 million were short term and $3.7 million were long term. As of June 30, 2024, both total investments\nand obligations under SERP were $5.4 million, of which $2.0 million were short term and $3.4 million were long term. The SERP investment assets are\nclassified as trading, and accordingly, realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in the Other Income (Expense) category on our Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Income. Adjustments made to revalue the SERP liability are also recognized in income as selling and administrative expenses and\noffset valuation adjustments on SERP investment assets. The change in net unrealized holding gains for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nwas approximately $0.3 million and $(0.2) million, respectively.\n18\nDefined Benefit Postemployment Plan:\nThe Company established and maintains severance plans for all domestic employees and other postemployment plans for certain foreign subsidiaries. There are\nno statutory requirements for us to contribute to the plans, nor do employees contribute to the plans. The plans hold no assets. Benefits are paid using available\ncash on hand when eligible employees meet plan qualifications for payment. As of September 30, 2024, total obligations under these plans were $7.4 million of\nwhich $6.6 million were long term and $0.8 million were short term. As of June 30, 2024, total obligations under these plans were $7.0 million of which $6.2\nmillion were long term and $0.8 million were short term. Net periodic benefit costs were not material for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nNote 12. Stock Compensation Plans\nA stock compensation plan was created and adopted by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) on September 20, 2023 and approved by our Share\nOwners at our 2023 Annual Meeting on November 17, 2023. The 2023 Plan allows for the issuance of up to 2.0 million shares and replaced our former 2014\nplan. The shares under the 2023 Plan may be granted in the form of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted\nawards, performance share awards, cash awards, and other equity awards. The Plan is a ten-year plan that terminates automatically on November 17, 2033. No\naward shall be granted pursuant to the Plan after such date, but awards theretofore granted may extend beyond that date.\nOn October 20, 2016, the Board approved a nonqualified deferred stock compensation plan, the Kimball Electronics, Inc. Non-Employee Directors Stock\nCompensation Deferral Plan (the “Deferral Plan”), which allows Non-Employee Directors to elect to defer all, or a portion of, their retainer fees in stock until\nretirement or termination from the Board or death. The Deferral Plan allows for issuance of up to 1.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock. For more\ninformation on the 2023 Plan and the Deferral Plan, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024.\nDuring the first three months of fiscal year 2025, the following stock compensation was granted under the 2023 Plan and the Deferral Plan.\nGrant Date Fair\nStock Compensation Granted Quarter Granted Shares/Units Value (2)\nLong-Term Performance Shares (1) 1st Quarter 23,460 $18.49\nRestricted Shares (3) 1st Quarter 152,917 $18.49\n(1) Long-term performance share awards for the leadership team members (consisting of our CEO and his direct reports) are expected to be granted in the\nsecond quarter of fiscal year 2025 upon approval of performance metrics by the Talent, Culture, and Compensation Committee of the Board (“Committee”).\nThe Committee granted long-term performance share awards to key employees not on our leadership team during the quarter. These awards granted in fiscal\nyear 2025 will cliff vest at the third anniversary of the award date in fiscal year 2028.\nFor these key employee awards, a number of shares will be issued to each participant based upon a combination of the Company’s profitability based on its\noperating income over the performance period as defined in the Company’s operating business plans for the applicable fiscal years and the Company’s\ngrowth based on a comparison of its three-year compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”) with the Electronics Manufacturing Services Industry’s three-\nyear CAGR. The number of shares issued could be zero if minimum thresholds are not met up to a maximum of 125% if results on both measures exceed\ntargets under the formula.\n(2) The grant date fair value is the weighted average stock price based on the dates of the grants.\n(3) Restricted shares were granted to leadership team members and other key employees. These restricted shares were approved by the Talent, Culture, and\nCompensation Committee of the Board. The contractual life of the restricted shares is three years, with one-third of the interest in the restricted shares\nvested after year one of the grant, another one-third after year two of the grant, and the final one-third after year three of the grant. Restricted shares are\nexpensed over the contractual vesting period as earned. If the employment of a holder of restricted shares terminates before the RSU has vested for any\nreason other than death, retirement, or disability, the restricted shares not yet vested will be forfeited.\n19\nNote 13.

Additional cautionary statements regarding other risk factors that could have an effect on the future performance of Kimball\nElectronics are contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024.\nBusiness Overview\nWe are a global, multifaceted manufacturing solutions provider. We provide electronics manufacturing services (“EMS”), including engineering and supply\nchain support, to customers in the automotive, medical, and industrial end markets. Our core competency is producing durable electronics, and we further offer\ncontract manufacturing services for non-electronic components, medical disposables, drug delivery solutions, and precision molded plastics. Our\nmanufacturing services, including engineering and supply chain support, utilize common production and support capabilities globally. We are well recognized\nby our customers and the industry for our excellent quality, reliability, and innovative service. CIRCUITS ASSEMBLY, a leading brand and technical\npublication for electronics manufacturers worldwide, has previously recognized us four times for achieving the Highest Overall Customer Rating in their\nService Excellence Awards, and most recently, we received Highest Overall Customer Ratings in four of their seven categories in 2023.\nThe contract manufacturing services industry is very competitive. As a mid-sized player, we can expect to be challenged by the agility and flexibility of the\nsmaller, regional players, and we can expect to be challenged by the scale and price competitiveness of the larger, global players. We enjoy a unique market\nposition between these extremes which allows us to compete with the larger scale players for high-volume projects, but also maintain our competitive position\nin the generally lower volume durable electronics market space. We expect to continue to effectively operate in this market space; however, one significant\nchallenge will be maintaining our profit margins while we continue our revenue growth. Pricing is competitive in the market as production efficiencies and\nmaterial pricing advantages for most projects drive costs and prices down over the life of the projects. This characteristic of the contract electronics\nmarketplace is expected to continue.\nThe Worldwide Manufacturing Services Market - 2024 Edition, a comprehensive study on the worldwide EMS market published by New Venture Research\n(“NVR”), provided worldwide forecast trends through 2028. NVR projects the worldwide assembly market for electronics products to grow at a compound\nannual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 4.6% over the next five years, with the EMS industry projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.6%.\nWe continue to monitor the current economic and industry conditions for uncertainties that may pose a threat to our future growth or cause disruption in\nbusiness strategy, execution, and timing in the markets in which we compete.\nThe EMS industry is experiencing the impacts of softening demand from global macroeconomic headwinds, especially in the current fiscal year. The financial\nimpact on our future results cannot be reasonably estimated but could be material. Such headwinds include pressure from elevated levels of inflation, higher\ninterest rates, and geopolitical uncertainty.\nNet sales in the first quarter of the current fiscal year decreased 15% compared to the prior fiscal year first quarter, with decreases in each of our end market\nverticals. The decrease in sales to customers in the automotive and medical markets were largely driven by decreased demand. The decrease in sales to\ncustomers in the industrial market were related to the sale of GES and continued softness specific to smart metering and climate control production. We expect\nconsolidated net sales to continue to lag when compared to fiscal year 2024 with the continued softness in demand and the loss of a major automotive program\n(impacts beginning in the third quarter) by our customer that was unrelated to any issues with our workmanship, quality, or ability to produce the product, in\naddition to the expected consolidated net sales decrease from the divestiture of our GES business.\nWe have a strong focus on cost control balanced with managing the future growth prospects of our business. We expect to make investments that will\nstrengthen or add new capabilities to our package of value as a multifaceted manufacturing solutions company, including through our recently completed\ncapacity expansions. Managing working capital in conjunction with fluctuating demand levels is likewise key. In addition, a long-standing component of our\nprofit-sharing incentive bonus plan is its link to our financial performance, which results in varying amounts of compensation expense as profits change.\n21\nTo support our renewed strategic focus, we completed the divestiture of our GES business on July 31, 2024 and undertook restructuring efforts beginning in\nfiscal year 2024 to align our cost structure with reduced end-market demand levels. In addition, on November 4, 2024, the Company announced that its Board\nof Directors has approved a plan to cease operations at our Tampa facility, expected to be completed by the end of the fiscal year. The decision was another\nimportant step towards sharpening our strategic focus, while leveraging our global footprint and streamlining the operating structure. Production activities on\nexisting customer programs will be transferred out of Tampa, with the majority of the work going to our plants in North America, primarily our newly\nexpanded facility in Mexico and Jasper.\nWe continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, which included a current ratio of 2.3, a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.4, and Share Owners’ equity of $548 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024. Recently, we have invested to support our expansions and growth in Mexico, Thailand, and Poland. Refer to the Future Liquidity section\nof Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further discussion of our liquidity.\nThe continuing success of our business is dependent upon our ability to replace expiring customers/programs with new customers/programs. We monitor our\nsuccess in this area by tracking the number of customers and the percentage of our net sales generated from them by years of service as depicted in the table\nbelow. While variation in the size of program awards makes it difficult to directly correlate this data to our sales trends, we believe it does provide useful\ninformation regarding our customer loyalty and new business growth.\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30\nCustomer Service Years 2024 2023\nMore than 10 Years\n% of Net Sales 78 % 74 %\n# of Customers 36 33\n5 to 10 Years\n% of Net Sales 15 % 20 %\n# of Customers 12 20\nLess than 5 Years\n% of Net Sales 7 % 6 %\n# of Customers 12 11\nTotal\n% of Net Sales 100 % 100 %\n# of Customers 60 64\nA detailed discussion of risk factors and uncertainties that could have an effect on our performance are located within the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024.\n22\nResults of Operations\nAt or for the\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30\nas a % of Net as a % of Net\n(Amounts in Millions, Except for Per Share Data) 2024 Sales 2023 Sales % Change\nNet Sales $ 374.3 $ 438.1 (15)%\nGross Profit $ 23.6 6.3 % $ 35.5 8.1 % (34)%\nSelling and Administrative Expenses 13.5 3.6 % 16.0 3.7 % (16)%\nRestructuring Expense 2.3 0.6 % — — % — %\nGain on Disposal (1.3) (0.3)% — — % — %\nOperating Income 9.1 2.4 % 19.5 4.4 % (53)%\nOther Income (Expense) (6.2) (6.2)\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes (0.3) 2.5 (111)%\nNet Income $ 3.2 $ 10.8 (71)%\nDiluted Earnings per Share $ 0.12 $ 0.43 (72)%\nOpen Orders $ 594 $ 907 (35)%\nNet Sales by Vertical Market Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30\n(Amounts in Millions) 2024 2023 % Change\nAutomotive $ 188.4 $ 212.5 (11)%\nMedical 89.8 102.4 (12)%\nIndustrial 96.1 123.2 (22)%\nTotal Net Sales $ 374.3 $ 438.1 (15)%\nFirst quarter fiscal year 2025 consolidated net sales decreased 15% compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. The impact from foreign currency\nfluctuations on net sales was less than 1% in the current quarter compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. By end market vertical, our market verticals\nfluctuated as follows:\n• Sales to customers in the automotive market decreased 11% during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year\n2024. The decrease in the first quarter is due to customer demand reductions, particularly in North America and Europe.\n• Sales to customers in the medical market declined in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. The decrease\nis primarily due to customer demand reductions.\n• Sales to customers in the industrial market decreased 22% during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, when compared to the first quarter of fiscal year\n2024. Approximately half of the decline is related to the sale of GES and the remainder is due to continued softness in industrial specific to smart\nmetering and climate control production.\nSales to Nexteer Automotive, ZF, and HL Mando accounted for the following portions of our net sales:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30\n2024 2023\nNexteer Automotive 18% 16%\nZF 13% 14%\nHL Mando * 10%\n* amount is less than 10% of total\n23\nGross profit as a percent of net sales in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 declined when compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 as we experienced\nlost absorption on lower revenue.\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased both as a percent of net sales and in absolute dollars in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 when compared to the\nfirst quarter of fiscal year 2024, driven by cost reduction efforts, decreased profit-sharing bonus expense, and the classification of factoring fees.\nIn the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded pre-tax restructuring expense of $2.3 million for employee-related costs as we undertook\nrestructuring efforts to align our cost structure with reduced end market demand levels.\nWe completed the divestiture of GES on July 31, 2024 and recorded a gain on disposal of $1.3 million during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. See Note 3 -\nSale of GES of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nOther Income (Expense) consisted of the following:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30\n(Amounts in Thousands) 2024 2023\nInterest income $ 222 $ 299\nInterest expense (4,792) (5,447)\nForeign currency/derivative gain (loss) (1,034) (674)\nGain (loss) on SERP investments 345 (177)\nFactoring fees (537) —\nCredit facilities fees and bank charges (263) (201)\nOther (172) (79)\nOther income (expense), net $ (6,231) $ (6,279)\nInterest expense has decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to lower interest\nrates and lower borrowings on credit facilities. Foreign currency/derivative gains (losses) result from net foreign currency exchange rate movements during the\nperiods. The revaluation to fair value of the SERP investments recorded in Other Income (Expense) is offset by the revaluation of the SERP liability recorded\nin Selling and Administrative Expenses, and thus there is no effect on net income. Prior to fiscal year 2025, factoring fees were recorded in Selling and\nAdministrative Expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.\nOur provision (benefit) for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $(0.3) million, or (9.4)% of income\nbefore taxes on income, and $2.5 million, or 18.6% of income before taxes on income, respectively. The tax benefit in the three months ended September 30,\n2024 was the result of an interest recovery on a prior period tax audit.\nOpen orders were down 35% as of September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. The decrease in open orders from September 30, 2023 is primarily\ndriven by reduced orders due to cancellation of a major automotive program, other automotive customer demand reductions, and medical customer demand\nreductions. Open orders at a point in time may not be indicative of future sales trends due to the contract nature of our business. Our open orders depend on the\nlead times from our customers, which have reduced since September 30, 2023 when parts were more constrained, which also contributed to the decline in open\norders.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking capital at September 30, 2024 was $439.0 million compared to working capital of $471.7 million at June 30, 2024. The current ratio was 2.3 at both\nSeptember 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. The debt-to-equity ratio was 0.4 at September 30, 2024 and 0.5 at June 30, 2024. Our short-term liquidity available,\nrepresented as cash and cash equivalents plus the unused amount of our credit facilities, some of which are uncommitted, totaled $263.4 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and $220.1 million at June 30, 2024.\n24\nCash Conversion Days (“CCD”) are calculated as the sum of Days Sales Outstanding (“DSO”) plus Contract Asset Days (“CAD”) plus Production Days\nSupply on Hand (“PDSOH”) less Accounts Payable Days (“APD”) and less Advances from Customers Days (“ACD”). CCD, or a similar metric, is used in our\nindustry and by our management to measure the efficiency of managing working capital. The following table summarizes our CCD for the quarterly periods\nindicated.\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nDays Sales Outstanding 66 58 58\nContract Asset Days 18 16 17\nProduction Days Supply on Hand 100 93 108\nAccounts Payable Days 56 50 71\nAdvances from Customers Days 20 17 9\nCash Conversion Days 108 100 103\nWe define Days Sales Outstanding as the average of monthly trade accounts and notes receivable divided by an average day’s net sales, Contract Asset Days as\nthe average monthly contract assets divided by an average day’s net sales, Production Days Supply on Hand as the average of monthly gross inventory divided\nby an average day’s cost of sales, Accounts Payable Days as the average of monthly accounts payable divided by an average day’s cost of sales, and Advances\nfrom Customers Days as the average of monthly customer deposits divided by an average day’s cost of sales. Over the past several quarters, we have supported\nour customers through strategic inventory builds to mitigate parts shortages, which adversely impacted our PDSOH and CCD metrics. We have experienced\ncustomers push out deliveries and sales declines, which have negatively impacted our cash conversion days and working capital. We expect our CCD metrics to\nimprove as we align our working capital with the lower sales levels.\nCash Flows\nThe following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the first three months of fiscal years 2025 and 2024.\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30\n(Amounts in Millions) 2024 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 45.5 $ 12.8\nNet cash provided by (used for) investing activities $ 5.2 $ (11.3)\nNet cash (used for) provided by financing activities $ (53.0) $ 14.0\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the first three months of fiscal year 2025 was driven by net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in\noperating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities for the first three months of the prior year was driven by net income adjusted for non-\ncash items, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nNet income adjusted for non-cash items provided cash of $16.8 million in the first three months of fiscal year 2025, while changes in operating assets and\nliabilities provided $28.7 million of cash in the first three months of fiscal year 2025, largely due to a decrease of accounts receivable, which provided cash of\n$20.1 million primarily resulting from decreased sales volumes compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, and an increase in advances from\ncustomers, which provided cash of $8.7 million. Partially offsetting cash provided by accounts receivable and advances from customers was a decrease in\naccrued expenses and taxes payable, which used cash of $22.5 million primarily driven by timing of profit-sharing incentive bonus and income tax payments.\nThe cash used of $9.7 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities in the first three months of fiscal year 2024 was largely due to an increase in\ninventory, which used cash of $34.0 million, driven by investment to support our newly expanded facilities, a decrease in accounts payable, which used cash of\n$11.6 million, and an increase in contract assets, which used cash of $8.9 million. Partially offsetting cash used by inventory, accounts payable, and contract\nassets was a decrease in accounts receivable, which provided cash of $45.3 million primarily resulting from decreased sales volumes compared to the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2023.\n25\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities of $5.2 million in the first three months of fiscal year 2025 was largely due to the $18.5 million of proceeds from the\nsale of GES, partially offset by capital investments of $13.5 million primarily to support new business awards and replacement of older machinery and\nequipment. See Note 3 - Sale of GES of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the divestiture of GES.\nNet cash used for investing activities in the first three months of fiscal year 2024 included $11.3 million cash used for capital investments. The capital\ninvestments were primarily to support new business awards, facility expansions, and replacement of older machinery and equipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nFor the first three months of fiscal year 2025, net cash used for financing activities of $53.0 million resulted largely from net payments on our credit facilities\nof $49.1 million. For the first three months of fiscal year 2024, net cash provided by financing activities of $14.0 million resulted largely from net borrowings\non our credit facilities of $15.4 million primarily for working capital purposes and capital expenditures.\nCredit Facilities\nThe Company maintains a U.S. primary credit facility (the “primary credit facility”) scheduled to mature May 4, 2027. The primary credit facility provides for\n$300 million in borrowings, with an option to increase the amount available for borrowing to $450 million at the Company’s request, subject to the consent of\neach lender participating in such increase. The Company also maintains a 364-day multi-currency revolving credit facility (the “secondary credit facility”),\nwhich allows for borrowings up to $100 million and has a maturity date of January 3, 2025. The proceeds of the loans on the primary credit facility and the\nsecondary credit facility are to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company. We were in compliance with the financial\ncovenants of the primary and secondary credit facilities during the period ended September 30, 2024.\nWe also maintain foreign credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes at specific foreign locations rather than utilizing funding from\nintercompany sources. These foreign credit facilities can be canceled at any time by either the bank or us and generally include renewal clauses. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we maintained foreign credit facilities at our Thailand operation, our China operation, our Netherlands subsidiary, and our Poland\noperation.\nSee Note 8 - Credit Facilities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our credit facilities, including the terms of the credit\nfacilities such as interest, commitment fees, and debt covenants.\nFactoring Arrangements\nWe participate in our customers’ supply chain financing arrangements in order to extend terms for the customer without negatively impacting our cash flow.\nThese arrangements in all cases do not contain recourse provisions which would obligate us in the event of our customers’ failure to pay. Receivables are\nconsidered sold when they are transferred beyond the reach of Kimball Electronics and its creditors, the purchaser has the right to pledge or exchange the\nreceivables, and we have surrendered control over the transferred receivables. In the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we sold, without\nrecourse, $87.3 million and $103.0 million of accounts receivable, respectively. See Note 1 - Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the factoring arrangements.\nFuture Liquidity\nWe believe our principal sources of liquidity from available funds on hand, cash generated from operations, and the availability of borrowing under our credit\nfacilities, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other operating needs for at least the next 12 months. The unused borrowings in USD equivalent\nunder all of our credit facilities totaled $186.8 million at September 30, 2024, including the $100 million secondary credit facility. Our secondary credit facility\nmatures on January 3, 2025. Additionally, accounts receivable factoring arrangements could provide flexible access to cash as needed. While our primary credit\nfacility includes a covenant that limits the amount of sold receivables outstanding at any time, currently and historically, we have been considerably below this\nlimit.\nWe expect to continue to prudently invest in capital expenditures, including for capacity expansions and potential acquisitions, that would help us continue our\ngrowth as a multifaceted manufacturing solutions company. At September 30, 2024, our capital expenditure commitments were approximately $13 million,\nconsisting primarily of capital related to new program wins. We anticipate our available liquidity will be sufficient to fund these capital expenditures.\n26\nWe expect to continue our restructuring efforts, including the closure of our Tampa facility. We expect these restructuring efforts to be predominantly cash\nexpenditures to be incurred over approximately the next 12 months and estimate between $10.0 million and $14.0 million of pre-tax restructuring charges,\nincluding $8.0 million to $11.0 million for Tampa exit costs. Once Tampa’s operations have ceased, we expect to sell the building and land, with the proceeds\nfrom the sale anticipated to exceed the exit costs.\nWe have purchase obligations that arise in the normal course of business for items such as raw materials, services, and software acquisitions/license\ncommitments. In certain instances, such as when lead times dictate, we enter into contractual agreements for material in excess of the levels required to fulfill\ncustomer orders. In turn, material authorization agreements with customers cover a portion of the exposure for material that we must purchase prior to having a\nfirm order.\nAt September 30, 2024, our foreign operations held cash totaling $75.7 million. Most of our accumulated unremitted foreign earnings have been invested in\nactive non-U.S. business operations, and it is not anticipated such earnings will be remitted to the United States. The Company continually evaluates its global\ncash needs. If such funds were repatriated or we determined that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer permanently reinvested, we may be\nsubject to applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes. Determination of the amount of any potential future unrecognized deferred tax liability on such\nunremitted earnings is not practicable and is recorded in the period when any foreign earnings are determined to be no longer permanently reinvested.\nThe Company’s Repurchase Plan allows the repurchase of up to $100 million of our common stock. Purchases may be made under various programs, including\nin open-market transactions, block transactions on or off an exchange, or in privately negotiated transactions, all in accordance with applicable securities laws\nand regulations. The Repurchase Plan has no expiration date but may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The extent to which the Company repurchases\nits shares, and the timing of such repurchases, will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements, and other corporate\nconsiderations, as determined by the Company’s management team. The Company expects to finance the purchases with existing liquidity. The Company has\nrepurchased $94.7 million of common stock under the Repurchase Plan through September 30, 2024.\nOur ability to generate cash from operations to meet our liquidity obligations could be adversely affected in the future by factors such as general economic and\nmarket conditions, lack of availability of raw material components in the supply chain, a decline in demand for our services, loss of key contract customers,\nunsuccessful integration of acquisitions and new operations, global health emergencies, and the related uncertainties around the financial impact, and other\nunforeseen circumstances. In particular, should demand for our customers’ products and, in turn, our services decrease significantly over the next 12 months,\nthe available cash provided by operations could be adversely impacted. Additional cautionary statements regarding our risk factors are contained in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024.\nFair Value\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, no level 1 or level 2 financial instruments were affected by a lack of market liquidity. For level 1 financial assets,\nreadily available market pricing was used to value the financial instruments. Our foreign currency derivative assets and liabilities, which were classified as\nlevel 2, were independently valued using observable market inputs such as forward interest rate yield curves, current spot rates, and time value calculations. To\nverify the reasonableness of the independently determined fair values, these derivative fair values were compared to fair values calculated by the counterparty\nbanks. Our own credit risk and counterparty credit risk had an immaterial impact on the valuation of the foreign currency derivatives. See Note 9 - Fair Value\nof Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2024, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nKimball Electronics’ Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America. These principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements and related notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions. Management uses its best judgment in\nthe assumptions used to value these estimates, which are based on current facts and circumstances, prior experience, and other assumptions that are believed to\nbe reasonable.\nThere have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024. For further\ninformation regarding our critical accounting policies, refer to “Note 1 - Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements and “Critical Accounting Policies” in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024.\n27\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 - Business Description and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information\nregarding New Accounting Standards.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThere were no material changes in our exposure to market risks for changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as compared to the fiscal year\nended June 30, 2024.\nComprehensive disclosures of quantitative and qualitative market risk can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024.\nItem 4.

Kimball Electronics\nSafe Harbor Statement\nCertain statements contained within this supplementary information, including our fiscal year 2025 guidance, and any\nstatements made during our earnings conference call today may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995. The statements may be identified by the use of words such as “expect,” “should,” “goal,”\n“predict,” “will,” “future,” “optimistic,” “confident,” and “believe.” Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-\nlooking statements. These statements are based on current expectations of future events and thus are inherently subject to\nuncertainty. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results\ncould vary materially from our expectations and projections. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and\nuncertainties including, without limitation, global economic conditions, geopolitical environment and conflicts such as the war\nin Ukraine, global health emergencies, availability or cost of raw materials and components, foreign exchange fluctuations,\nand our ability to convert new business opportunities into customers and revenue. Additional cautionary statements regarding\nother risk factors that could have an effect on the future performance of Kimball Electronics, Inc.

The non-GAAP financial measures contained herein\ninclude Constant Currency Growth, Adjusted Selling & Administrative Expenses, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net\nIncome, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share, and Return on Invested Capital (“ROIC”). Management believes these measures\nare useful and allow investors to meaningfully trend, analyze, and benchmark the performance of the Company’s core\noperations. Many of the Company’s internal performance measures that management uses to make certain operating\ndecisions use these and other non-GAAP measures to enable meaningful trending of core operating metrics.

Welcome to Kimball Electronics’ First Quarter Fiscal 2025\nEarnings Conference Call. My name is Maria, and I will be the facilitator for today's call. All lines\nhave been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. After the completion\nof the prepared remarks from Kimball Electronics’ leadership team, there will be a question-and-\nanswer period. To ask a question, simply press star and the number one on your telephone\nkeypad.\nToday's call, November 5, 2024 is being recorded. A replay of the call will be available on the\nInvestor Relations page of the Kimball Electronics website.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Andy Regrut, Treasurer and Investor Relations\nOfficer. Mr. Regrut, you may begin.\nAndy Regrut\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. With me\nhere today is Ric Phillips, our Chief Executive Officer, and Jana Croom, Chief Financial Officer. We\nissued a press release yesterday afternoon with our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025\nended September 30, 2024. To accompany today's call, a presentation has been posted to the\nInvestor Relations page on our company website.\nBefore we get started, I'd like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements\nthat involve risk and uncertainty and are subject to our Safe Harbor provisions as stated in our\npress release and SEC filings and that actual results can differ materially from the forward-looking\nstatements. Our commentary today will be focused on adjusted non-GAAP results.\nReconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts are available in our press release.\nInComm Conferencing Page 1 of 11 www.incommconferencing.com\nThis morning, Ric will start the call with a few opening comments, Jana will review the financial\nresults for the quarter and guidance for fiscal 2025, and Ric will complete our prepared remarks\nbefore taking your questions.\nI'll now turn the call over to Ric.\nRic Phillips\nThanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into the quarterly results and our\ncontinued theme to control what we can control, I'd like to take a moment to highlight the\nprogress we have made thus far to strategically position the business for the future. First, we\nrestructured the company by divesting the noncore AT&M business, and we folded the medical\nCMO business into our core EMS portfolio, allowing us greater focus on key and growing areas of\nthe medical vertical. We are seeing the differentiation and potential new customer opportunities\nfrom this shift.\nNext, and consistent with this move, we have sharpened our strategic focus in all three of our\nvertical markets to target attractive current and new market spaces that fit our capabilities. Some\nexamples of these spaces include domain controllers in automotive, off-highway equipment and\nenergy storage solutions in industrial and high-level assemblies and drug device combinations in\nmedical.\nAnother set of actions to position our business for the future has been on the cost side, where\nwe've been very proactive in adjusting our resources and cost to the ongoing market demand\nsoftness. This will serve us well as demand returns to more stable levels.\nIn addition, we've been shoring up our balance sheet, lowering inventory levels by over $150\nmillion and generating significant positive cash flow.\nFinally, last night, we announced a streamlining of our manufacturing footprint with the closure\nof our Tampa manufacturing facility, which I'll discuss more in a moment. But from a strategic\nperspective, this move will both drive efficiency for the future and will help provide the necessary\ndry powder to meaningfully invest in growing the core business, which we intend to do.\nCollectively, we believe this series of strategic moves will position us very well for the future.\nAs I mentioned a moment ago, we announced last night that we made the difficult decision to\nclose our facility in Tampa as part of our objective to sharpen the strategic focus of the company.\nThis will help us improve competitiveness by leveraging capacity in our global footprint while\nstreamlining the operating structure. Production activities on existing customer programs will be\ntransferred out of Tampa with the majority of the work going to the newly expanded facility in\nMexico and to our Jasper facility.\nWe expect operations in Tampa to cease by the end of the fiscal year, and we anticipate the\nfacility will close in Q1 of fiscal 2026. As you can imagine, shutting down a location is a difficult\nInComm Conferencing Page 2 of 11 www.incommconferencing.com\ndecision and one that we did not take lightly. But we feel it's an appropriate path forward,\nconsidering the preferences of our customers, our outlook for U.S. manufacturing and an\nobjective of returning the company to profitable growth and stronger performance. We are\ngrateful to the employees in Tampa and their accomplishments since the Reptron acquisition in\n2007. The team there played a vital role during the pandemic, supplying ventilators to those in\nneed, and we appreciate their contributions as part of Kimball.\nThroughout this process, we remain committed to doing the right thing for our people, our\ncustomers, our suppliers and the local community. These actions have been designed to set\nKimball up for a bright future. We look forward to sharing more with you as our strategy unfolds\nin the quarters to come.\nNow turning to the first quarter, with Q1 representing another chapter of controlling what we\ncan control while navigating the challenging operating environment stemming from sustained\nend market weakness. Our results were in line with expectations considering the difficult\ncomparisons from a record setting Q1 last year. We continue to adjust costs, improve working\ncapital management and generate positive cash flow to pay down debt, which was nearly $50\nmillion in Q1, reducing our debt levels to a two year low. Net sales in the quarter totaled $374\nmillion, a 15% decrease year-over-year. When excluding AT&M from both periods, the decrease\nwas 13%. From an end market perspective, each of the three verticals we serve posted declines.\nStarting with automotive, net sales were $188 million, down 11% compared to the first quarter\nlast year and 50% of total company sales. The decrease in Q1 occurred in Europe and North\nAmerica, partially offset by a modest increase in Asia. The decline in the quarter is due to volume\nsoftening, a result of overstocking, lower demand and dynamic timing of NPIs versus end-of-life\nproduction.\nAs we announced in August, we are working through a setback with an electronic braking\nprogram, our customer, a Tier 1 supplier, learned they will no longer be producing the system for\nthe OEM. We are supporting the wind down of production and transfer as necessary and expect\noperating activities to conclude by the end of Q3. As such, there was no impact to revenue in the\nquarter due to this program ending. On a positive note, we're on schedule with this same\ncustomer for the launch and ramp up of a new braking program in Romania in Q3. We expect\ngrowth in the vertical to return when vehicle sales burn through the elevated inventory levels\nthat exist in the industry wide supply chain.\nNext is medical with net sales in the first quarter of $90 million, a 12% decrease compared to the\nsame period last year and 24% of total company. The decline in the quarter was heavily\nconcentrated in Asia, driven by volume declines due to excess inventory. Additionally, North\nAmerica and Europe were both down slightly.\nAs we look forward, we're encouraged by the growth prospects in this vertical market with our\nfocus on higher level assemblies and finished medical devices. We were recently selected as the\nInComm Conferencing Page 3 of 11 www.incommconferencing.com\nsole supplier of the Respiratory Care Final Assembly and HLA business for our largest medical\ncustomer, and we are working toward the fiscal 2026 launch of this program. Our expertise in\nmanufacturing selected drug devices such as auto-injectors is a differentiator in an overall very\nattractive market, and we're encouraged about our current customer discussions and future\nopportunities in this area.\nFinally, industrial, with net sales of $96 million, down 22% year-over-year. When excluding AT&M\nfrom both periods, net sales were $94 million, a decrease of 17% and 25% of total company sales.\nThe decline predominantly occurred in North America and Europe; sales in Asia were down\nslightly with weak demand for internal climate control systems, public safety products and smart\nmeters in Europe, which have been commoditizing. We expect to return to growth coming from\na rebound for climate control products and opportunities in other sub-verticals within the\nindustrial space.\nI'll now turn the call over to Jana for more detail on the quarter and insights on the outlook. Jana?\nJana Croom\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. As Ric mentioned, our decision to close the facility in\nTampa was very difficult, and I echo his gratitude to our team in Florida. This decision did not\nimpact the first quarter, and it has not changed our outlook for adjusted results for the full year.\nWe will, however, be incurring additional restructuring expense, which I will outline in a moment.\nNet sales for the first quarter were $374.3 million. Foreign exchange had less than a 1% impact\non sales in the quarter. The gross margin rate in Q1 was 6.3%, a 180 basis point decline compared\nto the first quarter of fiscal 2024, with the decrease coming from lower absorption, a result of\ndeclining sales. As we continue to right-size the company, we should see a pickup in gross margin\nin the coming quarters.\nAdjusted selling and administrative expenses in the first quarter were $11 million, a $3.5 million\nor 24% reduction compared to the $14.5 million we reported in Q1 last year. The decrease was\ndriven by our efforts to align discretionary spending with current market demand and lower\nbonus expense, along with only one month of expense from AT&M in the quarter. When\nmeasured as a percentage of sales, adjusted selling and administrative expenses were 2.9%, a 40\nbasis point improvement compared to 3.3% in Q1 last year.\nAdjusted operating income for the first quarter was $12.6 million or 3.4% of net sales, which\ncompares to last year's adjusted results of $21 million or 4.8% of net sales. As a reminder, we\nhave adopted the industry norm of excluding stock comp expense from the calculation on this\nmetric. The results from last year has been recast to reflect this change.\nOther income and expense was expense of $6.2 million, virtually flat with last year's expense of\n$6.3 million with lower interest expense in the period offset by an increase from foreign currency\ntranslation.\nInComm Conferencing Page 4 of 11 www.incommconferencing.com\nThe effective tax rate was negative 9.4% in the first quarter compared to a positive 18.6% in Q1\nof fiscal '24, with the rate this quarter driven by a favorable ruling on a prior period tax audit. We\nexpect to resume a normalized tax rate in the mid-20s going forward. Adjusted net income in the\nfirst quarter of fiscal 2025 was $5.5 million or $0.22 per diluted share compared to adjusted net\nincome in Q1 last year of $12 million or $0.48 per diluted share.\nTurning now to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024, were $76.6\nmillion. Cash flows generated by operating activities in the quarter was $45.5 million, our third\nconsecutive quarter of positive cash flow and another example of our focus on controlling what\nwe can control, improving our balance sheet as we work through the challenges of declining\nrevenue. Cash conversion days were 108 days compared to 103 days in the first quarter of fiscal\n2024 and 100 days in Q4 last year. We are continuing to focus on improving cash conversion days\nby actively managing the components.\nInventory ended the quarter at $335.3 million, which represents a $147 million or 30% reduction\ncompared to Q1 last year. We are pleased with our progress in reducing inventory, and we'll\ncontinue to work with our customers to right-size the current demand outlook. Capital\nexpenditures in the first quarter were $13.5 million, balanced between maintenance\nrequirements and investments in longer term growth. Borrowings on our credit facility at\nSeptember 30, 2024, were $245.9 million, a $48.9 million reduction from last quarter and our\nlowest level of debt in two years.\nShort-term liquidity available, represented as cash and cash equivalents plus the unused portion\nof our credit facility, totaled $263.4 million at the end of the first quarter. In Q1, we invested $2.9\nmillion to repurchase 160,000 shares. Since October 2015 under our Board-authorized share\nrepurchase program, a total of $94.7 million has been returned to our shareholders by purchasing\n6.1 million shares of common stock. We have $5.3 million remaining on the repurchase program.\nWe are confirming our guidance for fiscal year 2025. As a reminder, we expect net sales to be in\nthe range of $1.44 billion to $1.54 billion, adjusted operating income of 4% to 4.5% of net sales\nand capital expenditures of $40 million to $50 million. We anticipate the Q2 revenue decline\nversus prior year to be roughly in line with Q1, but with margin improvement as we continue our\nrestructuring efforts. As part of the facility closing in Tampa, we expect to incur approximately\n$8 million to $11 million in total exit costs, including most significantly $6 million to $7 million in\nemployee termination benefits and $2 million to $3 million of logistical costs to transfer and\nvalidate programs at our other facilities as well as other ancillary costs. We expect these costs\nwill be predominantly cash expenditures.\nIn terms of its relative size, Tampa has annual revenue of approximately $75 million, primarily for\ncustomers in the medical and industrial verticals. By comparison, we delivered $500 million in\nsales in Mexico in fiscal 2024. We expect the programs transferred out of Tampa to go to Reynosa\nor come here to Jasper. To minimize disruption to our customers, the setup and qualification\nInComm Conferencing Page 5 of 11 www.incommconferencing.com\nprocess at the new facility will be run in parallel with the normal production runs in Tampa and\nwill be supported with low levels of safety stock. Once the transfers are complete and operations\nhave ceased, we expect to sell the building and land in Tampa with proceeds from the sales\nexceeding the exit cost.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Ric.\nRic Phillips\nThanks, Jana. Before we open the lines for questions, I'd like to share a few thoughts in closing.\nWith fiscal 2025, representing another year of controlling what we can control, our decision to\nleverage capacity within our global footprint and streamline our operating structure will improve\nour competitiveness and drive efficiency. The closure of the facility in Tampa aligns our\nelectronics manufacturing footprint in the U.S. with current and long-term market demand and\npositions the company to better utilize our facilities in low-cost regions.\nHowever, we also recognize that we cannot cut our way to greatness and that controlling what\nwe can control means also focusing on top line growth. We continue to actively pursue new\nopportunities where our core manufacturing capabilities support emerging technologies, most\nnotably in medical high-level assemblies and drug device combinations. With our strategic focus\non EMS operations and a strong balance sheet that now supports different avenues of growth,\nwe have intensified our efforts on where and how to profitably grow.\nLast quarter's announcement by our largest medical customer making Kimball the sole supplier\non the Respiratory Care Final Assembly and HLA business is a great example where we see the\nopportunity. I'm excited for the future of the company and thank you for your support.\nOperator, we would now like to open the lines for questions.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, analysts may ask a question at this time by simply press star, one on your\ndial pad. You may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star, two on your dial pad. We ask\nthat, if you’re using a speakerphone, you pick up your handset before asking your question. One\nmoment please for the first question.\nOur first question comes from Mike Crawford with B. Riley Securities. Please proceed with your\nquestion.\nMike Crawford\nThank you for giving us all that detail on the Tampa Bay facility. Can you remind us what it's on\nthe books for currently? And again, clarify whether the proceeds that you expect from selling the\nland and the building just exceeds this $8 million to $11 million you're talking about or the book\ncost, as well, of the land and building?\nInComm Conferencing Page 6 of 11 www.incommconferencing.com\nJana Croom\nYeah, so what we have on the books for is considerably less than what we would expect to sell\nthe building for. And so our estimate for the price that we could fetch for the land and building\nis somewhere around $18 million to $20 million, which significantly exceeds the exit cost. It's\nmore than -- it's roughly 2x the exit costs we expect.\nMike Crawford\nOkay, excellent. And then, Jana or Ric, could you maybe help us look at the business by vertical\nmarket and maybe characterize where the life cycle is of the majority of the programs within\nthere, whether they're programs that started out NPI and are still ramping up for years to come\nor if they've been in production for years and maybe are starting the long tail decline?\nJana Croom\nYeah, you want me to--yeah, okay--\nRic Phillips\n--Yeah. Okay. That's an interesting way to look at it.\nJana Croom\nNo, he's trying to figure out the portfolio of revenue, which I appreciate, Mike. So Industrial has\nthe shortest life span and probably the most NPIs that you're going to see, particularly over the\nnext 24 months. And then we've got three fairly significant programs ramping in automotive over\nthe next 18 months that are going to actually bring down the average life of that portfolio, one\nin Poland, one in China, and we announced the braking program that's coming on in Q3 in\nRomania. And then in Medical, Medical has a really nice steady stream of business coming on\nover time, and so the life of that portfolio tends to remain fairly stable in the five to six year\nrange.\nMike Crawford\nOkay, thank you, Jana. And just one more for me - so I know you've been studying potential\nadjacencies where you can find new avenues of growth, such as, I don't know, the off-highway\nequipment market. Is there any tangible progress there or any further focus on exactly what you\nmight -- what looks promising at this point?\nRic Phillips\nYeah, we haven't disclosed any specific wins, Mike. But the -- what I would say is the -- as we've\nsharpened our focus on -- and again, this isn't all new things, right? I mean, these are areas that\nwe continue to monitor to see is this the attractive space that we want to be in, such as braking\nand steering and automotive, which we continue to believe. Areas like domain controllers, energy\nstorage, off-highway equipment and particularly auto injectors and medical are those spaces\nwhere I guess I would characterize it as our level of discussion and quoting and readiness for\ninvestment is very high, and we're quite optimistic.\nInComm Conferencing Page 7 of 11 www.incommconferencing.com\nThose obviously take time to ramp up. So we don't have any specific win that we can disclose at\nthis point based on our agreements with customers, but we're really pleased with the activity\nand also the long-term attractiveness of some of those spaces.\nMike Crawford\nOkay, thank you very much.\nRic Phillips\nThank you, Mike.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Jaeson Schmidt with Lake Street. Please proceed with your\nquestion.\nJaeson Schmidt\nHi, guys, thanks for taking my question. You noted sort of the elevated inventory in auto. Just\ncurious what sort of visibility you guys have to that sort of clearing out? And how should we think\nabout the potential timeline?\nRic Phillips\nIt's a great question, Jaeson. What we do is we drive around and we see how many closed malls\nhave lots of cars in there as holding stations.\nNo, we're obviously in close touch with customers all the time about what they're seeing in\ndemand. We update our demand regularly. To your point, we have seen this sort of inventory\nglut that has persisted for a period of time. And so we adjust, we see ups and downs, but I\nwouldn't say we say it's a quarter from now, it's two quarters from now when this opens up. It's\nsomething that we have to monitor and try to get ahead of as best we can and adjust to. So I\ndon't think we have a clear line of sight to that demand stability, but we're on it.\nJaeson Schmidt\nOkay. No, That's more than fair. And how should we think about gross margin trending?\nObviously, it's going to be sort of revenue dependent, but any help on sort of the trajectory for\nthe remainder of fiscal '25.\nJana Croom\nYeah, Jaeson. And it's something that we -- that's where I'm spending the bulk of my time, right\n- so revenue by geographic area and the rightsizing and restructuring that we're doing. So\ndependent upon revenue and also dependent on how quickly we can drive the cost out of the\nfacilities, and the challenge with that is, to your previous question, when do we see volumes start\nto return in the space and what's the measured approach of cost containment versus being ready\nwhen demand comes back.\nInComm Conferencing Page 8 of 11 www.incommconferencing.com\nSo what I can tell you is gross margin of 6.3% is disappointing to everyone. It's something that\nwe've been after. We had $2.3 million of restructuring costs in the quarter; expect restructuring\ncosts in Q2 to be similar to that in terms of rightsizing the workforce for the demand that we see.\nAnd so I would expect a measured improvement in Q2 and more significant improvement in the\nback half of the year.\nJaeson Schmidt\nOkay, that’s really helpful. And then just the last one for me, and I'll jump back into queue - should\nwe consider September to be the low watermark for the year from a revenue perspective?\nJana Croom\nWell, if you look at the guide, and I realize I just gave it to you so you probably can’t do math on\nthe fly, we're seeing Q2 decline in line with Q1 decline quarter-over-quarter, which would\nindicate that Q2 revenue would be just slightly below Q1, as indicated. And so that would say to\nme that likely October is probably the low watermark. And I may have just (inaudible).\nJaeson Schmidt\nPerfect. Thanks a lot, guys.\nRic Phillips\nThank you, Jaeson.\nOperator\nAs a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star, one on your telephone\nkeypad.\nOur next question comes from Anja Soderstrom with Sidoti. Please proceed with your question.\nJana Croom\nMorning, Anja.\nAnja Soderstrom\nThank you for taking my -- good morning, everyone. Thanks you for taking my questions. I just\nwant to clarify, when you talk about the sequential decline in the second quarter to be on par\nwith the first quarter, is that by dollar amount?\nJana Croom\nBy revenue, yes.\nAnja Soderstrom\n(Inaudible)\nInComm Conferencing Page 9 of 11 www.incommconferencing.com\nJana Croom\nBut with improved gross margin.\nAnja Soderstrom\nOkay, yeah, yeah, and operating margin, right? And then I'm just curious to follow up on the\ninventory in the auto. Do you have a lot of inventory there because of the falloff from that\nprogram? And is there any remedy you can get from your customer there?\nJana Croom\nAutomotive has the longest lead time of inventory, and here's why that's challenging. You\nordered 12 months from now -- and remember, a year ago, we were ordering 18 months from\nnow, and before that, much further out as we were dealing with supply chain challenges. So you\norder, and then six months after you've placed the order and the inventory is coming, the\ndemand drops and you get the updated demand from customers. And so auto inventory is the\nmost challenging to deal with, right? So what can you cancel, what can you push out to align with\nthe demand that has a six month lag associated with it.\nAt the end of the day, you will work with your customers to right-size it. And so it becomes a\ntiming issue of just that inventory and the corresponding cost of that sitting on books. We're\ngetting better at faster demand signals, but we're going to see the impact of it creep up on us\nover the course of the year. We're managing it as effectively as we can, though.\nAnja Soderstrom\nOkay, thank you. And--\nRic Phillips\n--Sorry, Anja, just one follow up (it’s Ric) you mentioned the program cancellation. We are\ncertainly working with that Tier 1 customer on recovery and how we work through the wind down\nof that program. So, yes, but that's still in process.\nJana Croom\nYeah, we'll fully recover the inventory.\nAnja Soderstrom\nOkay. Thank you. That was helpful. And then the $11 million in the exit cost, is that going to fall\nmore in the back half of the year or--\nJana Croom\n--We will begin the TOW process immediately. And so I will tell you that we've contacted all of\nthe customers, we're in process. And so I would expect to see some of that cost come through in\nQ2.\nAnja Soderstrom\nInComm Conferencing Page 10 of 11 www.incommconferencing.com\nOkay. And have you quantified what kind of savings you expect to get from that closure?\nJana Croom\nI expected this question. We have not disclosed the savings. What I can tell you is, when you\nfigure out the depreciation, the indirect labor, the administrative overhead burden of closing a\nfacility. you will absolutely feel it on the consolidated. It would be a meaningful pickup to North\nAmerica and certainly to the consolidated enterprise. If you will be patient with me, I would like\nto -- when we report Q2, that's when we'll give you more information.\nAnja Soderstrom\nOkay.\nRic Phillips\nBut as you would expect, the utilization of those other North American facilities that are going to\nreceive transfer will improve as a result.\nAnja Soderstrom\nYes, yes, yes. No, I understand. That was all for me. Thank you.\nAnja Soderstrom\nThanks, Anja.\nOperator\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session and does conclude our conference call.
