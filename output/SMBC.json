(“Company”) (NASDAQ: SMBC), the parent corporation of Southern Bank (“Bank”), today announced preliminary net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 of $12.5 million, a decrease of $693,000 or 5.3%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease was due primarily to higher provision for credit loss (“PCL”) expense, as well as higher non-interest expense. This was partially offset by an increase in net interest income. Preliminary net income was $1.10 per fully diluted common share for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, a decrease of $0.06 as compared to $1.16 per fully diluted common share reported for the same period of the prior fiscal year. During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company engaged with a consultant to complete a performance improvement project to enhance operations and revenues of the Bank. The one-time cost associated with this review totaled $840,000, reduced after-tax net income by $652,000, or $0.06 per fully diluted common share, and was a primary reason for the increase in non-interest expense during the current period, noted in further detail below. \n\n**Highlights for the first quarter of fiscal 2025:**\n\n  * Earnings per common share (diluted) were $1.10, down $0.06, or 5.2%, as compared to the same quarter a year ago, and down $0.09, or 7.6% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the linked quarter. \n  * Annualized return on average assets (“ROA”) was 1.07%, while annualized return on average common equity (“ROE”) was 10.0%, as compared to 1.20% and 11.7%, respectively, in the same quarter a year ago, and 1.17% and 11.2%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the linked quarter. The one-time costs of the performance review recognized in the current quarter reduced after-tax ROA by six basis points.\n  * Net interest margin for the quarter was 3.37%, down from the 3.44% reported for the year ago period, and up from 3.25% reported for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the linked quarter. Net interest income increased $1.3 million, or 3.6%, as compared to the same quarter a year ago, and increased $1.6 million, or 4.5%, as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the linked quarter.\n  * Noninterest expense was up 9.0% for the quarter, as compared to the year ago period, primarily from increased compensation and benefits and legal and professional fees, and up 3.4% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the linked quarter. In the current quarter, legal and professional fees increased as the Bank incurred one-time costs of $840,000 associated with a performance improvement project. \n  * Gross loan balances increased by $116.7 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, or 3.0%, and increased by $266.8 million, or 7.2%, over the last twelve months.\n  * PCL was $2.2 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, a $1.3 million increase from both the year ago period and the June 30, 2024, linked quarter. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) attributable to individually evaluated loans, loan growth, and an increase in modeled expected losses. \n  * Deposit balances increased by $97.1 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, or 2.5%, and increased by $208.4 million, or 5.4%, over the last twelve months.\n  * Tangible book value per share was $38.26, and increased by $5.14 or 15.5% during the last twelve months. \n\n\n\n**Dividend Declared:**\n\nThe Board of Directors, on October 22, 2024, declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $0.23, payable November 29, 2024, to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 15, 2024, marking the 122nd consecutive quarterly dividend since the inception of the Company. The Board of Directors and management believe the payment of a quarterly cash dividend enhances stockholder value and demonstrates our commitment to and confidence in our future prospects.\n\n**Conference Call:**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call to review the information provided in this press release on Tuesday, October 29, 2024, at 9:30 a.m., central time. The call will be available live to interested parties by calling 1-833-470-1428 in the United States and from all other locations. Participants should use participant access code 523822. Telephone playback will be available beginning one hour following the conclusion of the call through November 2, 2024. The playback may be accessed by dialing 1-866-813-9403, and using the conference passcode 217957.\n\n**Balance Sheet Summary:**\n\nThe Company experienced balance sheet growth in the first three months of fiscal 2025, with total assets of $4.7 billion at September 30, 2024, reflecting an increase of $124.9 million, or 2.7%, as compared to June 30, 2024. Growth primarily reflected an increase in net loans receivable and cash equivalents and time deposits.\n\nCash equivalents and time deposits were $75.6 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of $14.2 million, or 23.1%, as compared to June 30, 2024. Available for sale securities were $420.2 million at September 30, 2024, down $7.7 million, or 1.8%, as compared to June 30, 2024, as the Company was less active in reinvesting principal payments received.\n\nLoans, net of the ACL, were $3.9 billion at September 30, 2024, increasing by $114.8 million, or 3.0%, as compared to June 30, 2024. The Company noted growth in both the real estate and commercial portfolios. Real estate loan growth was primarily driven by drawn construction, 1-4 family residential, and owner occupied commercial real estate loan balances. This was somewhat offset by a decrease in loans secured by multi-family property. In the commercial portfolio, growth was driven by seasonal agricultural production loan draws and modest growth in commercial and industrial loan balances. The table below illustrates changes in loan balances by type over recent periods:\n\n**Summary Loan Data as of:**| **Sept 30,**| **June 30,**| **Mar. 31,**| **Dec. 31,**| **Sep. 30,**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_| **2024**| **2024**| **2024**| **2023**| **2023**  \n1-4 residential real estate| $| 942,916| $| 925,397| $| 903,371| $| 893,940| $| 875,666  \nNon-owner occupied commercial real estate| 903,678| 899,770| 898,911| 863,426| 846,875  \nOwner occupied commercial real estate| 438,030| 427,476| 412,958| 403,109| 422,824  \nMulti-family real estate| 371,177| 384,564| 417,106| 380,632| 365,890  \nConstruction and land development| 567,002| 499,587| 495,284| 562,773| 620,313  \nAgriculture real estate| 239,787| 232,520| 233,853| 238,093| 239,787  \nTotal loans secured by real estate| 3,462,590| 3,369,314| 3,361,483| 3,341,973| 3,371,355  \nCommercial and industrial| 457,018| 450,147| 436,093| 443,532| 431,178  \nAgriculture production| 200,215| 175,968| 139,533| 146,254| 164,631  \nConsumer| 58,735| 59,671| 56,506| 57,771| 58,706  \nAll other loans| 3,699| 3,981| 4,799| 7,106| 6,724  \nTotal loans| 4,182,257| 4,059,081| 3,998,414| 3,996,636| 4,032,594  \nUnfunded commitments on construction loans| (215,521| (209,046| (226,969| (264,483| (332,633  \nDeferred loan fees, net| (218| (232| (251| (263| (282  \nGross loans| 3,966,518| 3,849,803| 3,771,194| 3,731,890| 3,699,679  \nAllowance for credit losses| (54,437| (52,516| (51,336| (50,084| (49,122  \nNet loans| $| 3,912,081| $| 3,797,287| $| 3,719,858| $| 3,681,806| $| 3,650,557  \n  \nLoans anticipated to fund in the next 90 days totaled $168.0 million at September 30, 2024, as compared to $157.1 million at June 30, 2024, and $158.2 million at September 30, 2023.\n\nThe Bank’s concentration in non-owner occupied commercial real estate, as defined for regulatory purposes, is estimated at 320.1% of Tier 1 capital and ACL at September 30, 2024, as compared to 317.5% as of June 30, 2024, the linked quarter end, with these loans representing 46.4% of gross loans at September 30, 2024. Multi-family residential real estate, hospitality (hotels/restaurants), care facilities, retail stand-alone, and strip centers are the most common collateral types within the non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio. The multi-family residential real estate loan portfolio commonly includes loans collateralized by properties currently in the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) program or having exited the program. The hospitality and retail stand-alone segments include primarily franchised businesses; care facilities consisting mainly of skilled nursing and assisted living centers; and strip centers can be defined as non-mall shopping centers with a variety of tenants. Non-owner-occupied office property types included 34 loans totaling $24.9 million, or 0.63% of gross loans at September 30, 2024, none of which were adversely classified, and are generally comprised of smaller spaces with diverse tenants. The Company continues to monitor its commercial real estate concentration and the individual segments closely.\n\nNonperforming loans were $8.2 million, or 0.21% of gross loans, at September 30, 2024, as compared to $6.7 million, or 0.17% of gross loans at June 30, 2024. Nonperforming assets were $12.1 million, or 0.26% of total assets, at September 30, 2024, as compared to $10.6 million, or 0.23% of total assets, at June 30, 2024. The change in nonperforming assets was attributable to the increase of $1.5 million in nonperforming loans, of which the largest individual loan was collateralized by a single-family residential property.\n\nOur ACL at September 30, 2024, totaled $54.4 million, representing 1.37% of gross loans and 663% of nonperforming loans, as compared to an ACL of $52.5 million, representing 1.36% of gross loans and 786% of nonperforming loans, at June 30, 2024. The Company has estimated its expected credit losses as of September 30, 2024, under ASC 326-20, and management believes the ACL as of that date was adequate based on that estimate. There remains, however, significant uncertainty as the Federal Reserve has tightened monetary policy to address inflation risks. Qualitative adjustments in the Company’s ACL model were slightly decreased compared to June 30, 2024. The Company increased the allowance attributable to classified hotel loans that have been slow to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, PCL was required due to loan growth in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and a slight increase in modeled expected losses due to a modest increase in the unemployment rate expectations. As a percentage of average loans outstanding, the Company recorded net charge offs of 0.01% (annualized) during the current period, as compared to 0.03% for the same period of the prior fiscal year.\n\nTotal liabilities were $4.2 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $108.0 million, or 2.6%, as compared to June 30, 2024.\n\nDeposits were $4.0 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $97.1 million, or 2.5%, as compared to June 30, 2024. The deposit portfolio saw increases in certificates of deposit and savings accounts, as customers remained willing to move balances into high yield savings accounts and special rate time deposits during the higher rate environment. Public unit balances totaled $510.5 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of $84.1 million compared to June 30, 2024, due to the Company losing the bid to retain a larger local public unit depositor, and also experienced expected seasonal decreases in these accounts. Brokered deposits totaled $273.2 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of $99.4 million compared to June 30, 2024. The Company increased brokered deposits in the quarter due to more attractive pricing for brokered certificates of deposits relative to local market rates and the need to meet seasonal loan demand. The average loan-to-deposit ratio for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was 98.4%, as compared to 96.3% for the linked quarter. The table below illustrates changes in deposit balances by type over recent periods:\n\n**Summary Deposit Data as of:**| **Sep. 30,**| **June 30,**| **Mar. 31,**| **Dec. 31,**| **Sep. 30,**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_| **2024**| **2024**| **2024**| **2023**| **2023**  \nNon-interest bearing deposits| $| 503,209| $| 514,107| $| 525,959| $| 534,194| $| 583,353  \nNOW accounts| 1,128,917| 1,239,663| 1,300,358| 1,304,371| 1,231,005  \nMMDAs - non-brokered| 320,252| 334,774| 359,569| 378,578| 415,115  \nBrokered MMDAs| 12,058| 2,025| 10,084| 20,560| 20,272  \nSavings accounts| 556,030| 517,084| 455,212| 372,824| 313,135  \nTotal nonmaturity deposits| 2,520,466| 2,607,653| 2,651,182| 2,610,527| 2,562,880  \nCertificates of deposit - non-brokered| 1,258,583| 1,163,650| 1,158,063| 1,194,993| 1,066,165  \nBrokered certificates of deposit| 261,093| 171,756| 176,867| 179,980| 202,683  \nTotal certificates of deposit| 1,519,676| 1,335,406| 1,334,930| 1,374,973| 1,268,848  \nTotal deposits| $| 4,040,142| $| 3,943,059| $| 3,986,112| $| 3,985,500| $| 3,831,728  \nPublic unit nonmaturity accounts| $| 447,638| $| 541,445| $| 572,631| $| 544,873| $| 491,868  \nPublic unit certificates of deposit| 62,882| 53,144| 51,834| 49,237| 52,989  \nTotal public unit deposits| $| 510,520| $| 594,589| $| 624,465| $| 594,110| $| 544,857  \n  \nFHLB advances were $107.1 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of $5.0 million, or 4.9%, from June 30, 2024, due to maturing advances which were not renewed. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company continued to have no FHLB overnight borrowings at the end of the period. \n\nThe Company’s stockholders’ equity was $505.6 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of $16.9 million, or 3.5%, as compared to June 30, 2024. The increase was attributable primarily to earnings retained after cash dividends paid, in combination with a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive losses (“AOCL”) as the market value of the Company’s investments appreciated due to decreases in market interest rates. The AOCL decreased from $17.4 million at June 30, 2024, to $10.6 million at September 30, 2024. The Company does not hold any securities classified as held-to-maturity.\n\n**Quarterly Income Statement Summary:**\n\nThe Company’s net interest income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was $36.7 million, an increase of $1.3 million, or 3.6%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was attributable to a 5.9% increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets in the current three-month period, as compared to the same period a year ago, partially offset by a seven-basis point decrease in net interest margin, from 3.44% to 3.37%, as the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 70 basis points, outpacing the 54-basis point increase in the yield earned on interest earning assets. Net interest income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, grew $1.6 million, or 4.5%, as compared to the June 30, 2024, linked quarter, attributable to a 12-basis point increase in the net interest margin and a 0.7% increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets. The primary driver of the net interest margin expansion, compared to the linked quarter, was the 21-basis point increase in the yield on interest-earning assets, partially offset by the 11-basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Contributing to the margin increase, the average loan to deposit ratio increased by 2.4 percentage points in the current period, as compared to the linked quarter, as the balance sheet composition shifted toward higher yielding assets.\n\nLoan discount accretion and deposit premium amortization related to the November 2018 acquisition of First Commercial Bank, the May 2020 acquisition of Central Federal Savings & Loan Association, the February 2022 merger of FortuneBank, and the January 2023 acquisition of Citizens Bank & Trust resulted in $975,000 in net interest income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $1.7 million in net interest income for the same period a year ago. Combined, this component of net interest income contributed nine basis points to net interest margin in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a 16-basis point contribution for the same period of the prior fiscal year, and as compared to a ten-basis point contribution in the linked quarter ended June 30, 2024, when net interest margin was 3.25%.\n\nThe Company recorded a PCL of $2.2 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a PCL of $900,000 in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The current period PCL was the result of a $2.0 million provision attributable to the ACL for loan balances outstanding and a $138,000 provision attributable to the allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures.\n\nThe Company’s noninterest income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was $7.2 million, an increase of $1.3 million, or 22.6%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily attributable to other loan fees, deposit account charges and related fees, bank card interchange income, and net realized gains on sale of loans. Net realized gains on sale of loans increased due to sales of Small Business Administration loans. These increases were partially offset by lower loan late charges, wealth management fees, and other non-interest income. Other non-interest income decreased primarily due to modest losses on the disposal of fixed assets, which were comprised of various equipment.\n\nNoninterest expense for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was $25.8 million, an increase of $2.1 million, or 9.0%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. In the current quarter, this increase in noninterest expense was attributable primarily to increases in compensation and benefits, legal and professional fees, occupancy and equipment, and advertising expenses. The increase in compensation and benefits expense was primarily due to a trend increase in employee headcount, as well as annual merit increases. Legal and professional expenses increased primarily due to a one-time expense associated with a performance improvement project that started during the first fiscal quarter of 2025, as discussed above. This expense was fully realized in the September quarter, with only modest reimbursables remaining to be recognized in later quarters. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased primarily due to depreciation on recent capitalized expenditures, including buildings, equipment, and signage. Advertising activity in the current quarter increased marketing expenses compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year.\n\nThe efficiency ratio for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was 59.0%, as compared to 57.5% in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The change was attributable to noninterest expense growing faster than revenues. Excluding the one-time performance improvement project costs, the efficiency ratio for the first quarter of 2025 would have been lower by two percentage points.\n\nThe income tax provision for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was $3.4 million, a decrease of 3.2%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the decrease in net income before income taxes. The effective tax rate was 21.3% as compared to 21.0% in the same quarter of the prior fiscal year. \n\n**Forward-Looking Information:**\n\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this press release may be deemed to be forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, including: potential adverse impacts to the economic conditions in the Company’s local market areas, other markets where the Company has lending relationships, or other aspects of the Company’s business operations or financial markets, expected cost savings, synergies and other benefits from our merger and acquisition activities might not be realized to the extent expected, within the anticipated time frames, or at all, and costs or difficulties relating to integration matters, including but not limited to customer and employee retention and labor shortages, might be greater than expected and goodwill impairment charges might be incurred; the strength of the United States economy in general and the strength of local economies in which we conduct operations; fluctuations in interest rates and the possibility of a recession; monetary and fiscal policies of the FRB and the U.S. Government and other governmental initiatives affecting the financial services industry; the risks of lending and investing activities, including changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses; our ability to access cost-effective funding; the timely development of and acceptance of our new products and services and the perceived overall value of these products and services by users, including the features, pricing and quality compared to competitors' products and services; fluctuations in real estate values in both residential and commercial real estate markets, as well as agricultural business conditions; demand for loans and deposits; legislative or regulatory changes that adversely affect our business; changes in accounting principles, policies, or guidelines; results of regulatory examinations, including the possibility that a regulator may, among other things, require an increase in our reserve for loan losses or write-down of assets; the impact of technological changes; and our success at managing the risks involved in the foregoing.

(“Company”) (NASDAQ: SMBC), the parent corporation of Southern Bank (“Bank”), today announced preliminary net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 of $13.5 million, a decrease of $2.0 million or 13.0%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to lower net interest income and noninterest income. Preliminary net income was $1.19 per fully diluted common share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, a decrease of $0.18 as compared to the $1.37 per fully diluted common share reported for the same period of the prior fiscal year. For the full fiscal year 2024, preliminary net income of $50.2 million was an increase of $10.9 million as compared to fiscal 2023, while diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2024 were $4.42, an increase of $0.57 as compared to the $3.85 per fully diluted common share for fiscal 2023. The fiscal 2023 after-tax impact of the merger-related provision for credit losses (“PCL”) required to achieve the “Day 1” allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) on acquired loans and off-balance sheet credit exposures, and merger-related noninterest expenses, were estimated to have reduced diluted EPS by $0.95. \n\n**Highlights for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024:**\n\n  * Earnings per common share (diluted) were $1.19, down $0.18, or 13.1%, as compared to the same quarter a year ago, and up $0.20, or 20.2% from the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the linked quarter. \n  * Annualized return on average assets (“ROA”) was 1.17%, while annualized return on average common equity (“ROE”) was 11.2%, as compared to 1.44% and 14.1%, respectively, in the same quarter a year ago, and 0.97% and 9.5%, respectively, in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the linked quarter.\n  * Net interest margin for the quarter was 3.25%, down from the 3.60% reported for the year ago period, and up from 3.15% reported for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the linked quarter. Net interest income decreased $1.1 million, or 3.1%, as compared to the same quarter a year ago, and increased $586,000, or 1.7%, as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the linked quarter.\n  * Noninterest income was down 13.2% for the quarter, as compared to the year ago period, and up 39.1% as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the linked quarter. The increase as compared to the linked quarter was partially due to losses realized on sale of securities in the linked quarter, while other seasonal factors also contributed.\n  * Gross loan balances increased by $78.6 million during the fourth quarter, and increased by $230.9 million, or 6.4%, during all of fiscal 2024.\n  * Deposit balances decreased by $43.1 million during the fourth quarter, and increased by $226.9 million, or 6.1%, during all of fiscal 2024. The decrease in deposits during the fourth quarter was attributed to seasonal patterns of our public unit and agricultural depositors.\n  * Cash equivalent balances decreased by $107.4 million during the fourth quarter, and increased $6.2 million during all of fiscal 2024. The decrease in the current quarter was attributed to the outflow of seasonal deposits and the funding of loan growth.\n  * The Company repurchased 88,357 shares of its common stock in the fourth quarter at an average price of $41.53 per share, for a total of $3.7 million. The average purchase price was 95.3% of our $43.56 book value as of June 30, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Dividend Declared:**\n\nThe Board of Directors, on July 23, 2024, declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $0.23 per share, payable August 30, 2024, to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 15, 2024, marking the 121st consecutive quarterly dividend since the inception of the Company. The dividend represents an increase of $0.02 per share, or 9.5%, as compared to the previous quarterly dividend payment. The Board of Directors and management believe the payment of a quarterly cash dividend enhances stockholder value and demonstrates our commitment to and confidence in our future prospects.\n\n**Conference Call:**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call to review the information provided in this press release on Tuesday, July 30, 2024, at 9:30 a.m., central time. The call will be available live to interested parties by calling 1-833-470-1428 in the United States and from all other locations. Participants should use participant access code 779083. Telephone playback will be available beginning one hour following the conclusion of the call through August 4, 2024.

Growth primarily reflected an increase in net loans receivable, available-for-sale (AFS) securities, and cash equivalents.\n\nCash equivalents were a combined $61.4 million at June 30, 2024, an increase of $6.2 million, or 11.2%, as compared to June 30, 2023. Compared to March 31, 2024, the linked quarter, cash equivalents decreased $107.4 million, or 63.6%, primarily from a combination of seasonal deposit outflows from our public unit and agriculture depositors and from the funding of loan growth. AFS securities were $427.9 million at June 30, 2024, up $10.3 million, or 2.5%, as compared to June 30, 2023.\n\nLoans, net of the ACL, were $3.8 billion at June 30, 2024, an increase of $226.2 million, or 6.3%, as compared to June 30, 2023. Gross loans increased by $230.9 million, while the ACL attributable to outstanding loan balances increased $4.7 million, or 9.8%, as compared to June 30, 2023. The increase in loan balances was attributable to growth in non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, residential real estate loans, agricultural revolving lines of credit, and drawn construction loan balances. This was partially offset by payoffs and paydowns in owner-occupied commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, multi-family, and agriculture real estate loans.\n\nLoans anticipated to fund in the next 90 days totaled $157.1 million at June 30, 2024, as compared to $117.2 million at March 31, 2024, and $134.8 million at June 30, 2023.\n\nThe Bank’s concentration in non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans is estimated at 317.5% of Tier 1 capital and ACL at June 30, 2024, as compared to 330.2% as of June 30, 2023, with these loans representing 40.9% of total loans at June 30, 2024. Multi-family residential real estate, hospitality (hotels/restaurants), care facilities, retail stand-alone, and strip centers are the most common collateral types within the non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio. The multi-family residential real estate loan portfolio commonly includes loans collateralized by properties currently in the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) program or having exited the program. The hospitality and retail stand-alone segments include primarily franchised businesses; care facilities consist mainly of skilled nursing and assisted living centers; and strip centers can be defined as non-mall shopping centers with a variety of tenants. Non-owner occupied office property types included 35 loans totaling $25.1 million, or 0.65% of total loans at June 30, 2024, none of which were adversely classified as of June 30, 2024, and are generally comprised of smaller spaces with diverse tenants. The Company continues to monitor its commercial real estate concentration and the individual segments closely.\n\nNonperforming loans were $6.7 million, or 0.17% of gross loans, at June 30, 2024, as compared to $7.7 million, or 0.21% of gross loans, at June 30, 2023. Nonperforming assets were $10.6 million, or 0.23% of total assets, at June 30, 2024, as compared to $11.3 million, or 0.26% of total assets, at June 30, 2023.\n\nOur ACL at June 30, 2024, totaled $52.5 million, representing 1.36% of gross loans and 786% of nonperforming loans, as compared to an ACL of $47.8 million, representing 1.32% of gross loans and 625% of nonperforming loans, at June 30, 2023. The Company has estimated its expected credit losses as of June 30, 2024, under ASC 326-20, and management believes the ACL as of that date is adequate based on that estimate. There remains, however, significant uncertainty as the Federal Reserve has tightened monetary policy to address inflation risks. Management continues to closely monitor, in particular, borrowers in the hotel industry that were slow to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTotal liabilities were $4.1 billion at June 30, 2024, an increase of $201.4 million, or 5.1%, as compared to June 30, 2023. Growth primarily reflected an increase in total deposits and other liabilities from the increase of accrued interest payable and income taxes payable. These increases in deposits and other liabilities were partially offset by a decrease in FHLB advances.\n\nDeposits were $4.0 billion at June 30, 2024, an increase of $226.9 million, or 6.1%, as compared to June 30, 2023. The deposit portfolio saw increases during the fiscal year in certificates of deposit and savings accounts, as customers remained willing to move balances into high yield savings accounts and special rate time deposits during the higher rate environment. Public unit balances totaled $594.6 million at June 30, 2024, an increase of $16.1 million compared to June 30, 2023, but a decrease of $29.9 million from March 31, 2024, the linked quarter, reflecting seasonal trends. Brokered deposits totaled $173.8 million at June 30, 2024, an increase of $14.2 million as compared to June 30, 2023, but a decrease of $13.2 million compared to March 31, 2024, the linked quarter. The average loan-to-deposit ratio for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 was 96.0%, as compared to 95.8% for the same period of the prior fiscal year. The table below illustrates changes in deposit balances by type over recent periods: \n\n**Summary Deposit Data as of:**| **June 30,**| **Mar. 31,**| **Dec. 31,**| **Sep. 30,**| **June 30,**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_| **2024**| **2024**| **2023**| **2023**| **2023**  \nNon-interest bearing deposits| $| 514,107| $| 525,959| $| 534,194| $| 583,353| $| 597,600  \nNOW accounts| 1,239,663| 1,300,358| 1,304,371| 1,231,005| 1,328,423  \nMMDAs - non-brokered| 334,774| 359,569| 378,578| 415,115| 439,652  \nBrokered MMDAs| 2,025| 10,084| 20,560| 20,272| 13,076  \nSavings accounts| 517,084| 455,212| 372,824| 313,135| 282,753  \nTotal nonmaturity deposits| 2,607,653| 2,651,182| 2,610,527| 2,562,880| 2,661,504  \nCertificates of deposit - non-brokered| 1,173,048| 1,167,461| 1,204,391| 1,075,563| 917,489  \nBrokered certificates of deposit| 171,756| 176,867| 179,980| 202,683| 146,547  \nTotal certificates of deposit| 1,344,804| 1,344,328| 1,384,371| 1,278,246| 1,064,036  \nTotal deposits| $| 3,952,457| $| 3,995,510| $| 3,994,898| $| 3,841,126| $| 3,725,540  \nPublic unit nonmaturity accounts| $| 541,445| $| 572,631| $| 544,873| $| 491,868| $| 523,164  \nPublic unit certficates of deposit| 53,144| 51,834| 49,237| 52,989| 55,344  \nTotal public unit deposits| $| 594,589| $| 624,465| $| 594,110| $| 544,857| $| 578,508  \n  \nFHLB advances were $102.1 million at June 30, 2024, a decrease of $31.5 million, or 23.6%, as compared to June 30, 2023, as the Company utilized deposit growth to repay overnight and maturing term advances. For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company continued to have no FHLB overnight borrowings.\n\nThe Company’s stockholders’ equity was $488.7 million at June 30, 2024, an increase of $42.7 million, or 9.6%, as compared to June 30, 2023. The increase was attributable primarily to earnings retained after cash dividends paid, in combination with a $4.5 million reduction in accumulated other comprehensive losses (“AOCL”) primarily as a result of the market value of the Company’s investments appreciating during the fiscal year due to the decrease in market interest rates. The reduction in AOCL was also partially due to losses of $1.5 million recognized during the fiscal year on the sale of AFS securities. The AOCL totaled $17.4 million at June 30, 2024, as compared to $21.9 million at June 30, 2023. The Company does not hold any securities classified as held-to-maturity. The increase in stockholders’ equity was partially offset by $3.9 million utilized for repurchases of 92,795 shares of the Company’s common stock during fiscal 2024 at an average price of $41.56 per share.\n\n**Quarterly Income Statement Summary:**\n\nThe Company’s net interest income for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, was $35.1 million, a decrease of $1.1 million, or 3.1%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease was attributable to a decrease of 35 basis points in net interest margin, partially offset by a 7.5% increase in the average balance of interest earning assets. The primary driver of the net interest margin decline, compared to the year ago period, was the cost of interest bearing liabilities increasing 110 basis points, partially offset by the yield on interest earning assets increasing 59 basis points. Contributing to the margin decline, interest bearing liabilities increased by 9.5%, as compared to the 7.5% increase in interest earning assets, as our deposit mix shifted away from noninterest bearing accounts. Net interest income for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, grew $586,000, or 1.7%, as compared to the March 31, 2024, linked quarter. The increase was attributable to a ten basis point increase in the net interest margin, partially offset by a decline of 1.3% in the average balance of interest earning assets. The primary driver of the net interest margin expansion, compared to the linked quarter, was the yield on interest earning assets increasing 14 basis points, while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased only eight basis points. Contributing to the margin increase, the average loan to deposit ratio increased to 96.0% in the current period, as compared to 92.5% in the linked quarter, as the balance sheet shifted to higher yielding assets.\n\nLoan discount accretion and deposit premium amortization related to the November 2018 acquisition of First Commercial Bank, the May 2020 acquisition of Central Federal Savings & Loan Association, the February 2022 merger of FortuneBank, and the January 2023 acquisition of Citizens Bank & Trust resulted in $1.1 million in net interest income for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $1.6 million in net interest income for the same period a year ago. Combined, this component of net interest income contributed ten basis points to net interest margin in the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, as compared to a 16 basis point contribution for the same period of the prior fiscal year, and as compared to an 11 basis point contribution in the linked quarter, ended March 31, 2024, when net interest margin was 3.15%.\n\nThe Company recorded a PCL of $900,000 in the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, as compared to a PCL of $795,000 in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The current period PCL was the result of a $1.8 million provision attributable to the ACL for loan balances outstanding, partially offset by a recovery of $875,000 in provision attributable to the allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures, as construction draws reduced available credit and increased on-balance sheet exposure. The Company’s assessment of the economic outlook has improved as compared to the assessment as of June 30, 2023, but reserves were modestly increased due to qualitative factors and individually evaluated credits, slightly expanding the ACL as a percentage of total loans. As a percentage of average loans outstanding, the Company recorded net charge offs of six basis points (annualized) during the current period, compared to two basis points during the same period of the prior fiscal year.\n\nThe Company’s noninterest income for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, was $7.8 million, a decrease of $1.2 million, or 13.2%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease was attributable to lower other loan fees, gains on sales of loans, loan servicing fees, deposit account charges, and wealth management fees. Other loan fees, loan servicing fees, and gains on sales of loans decreased due to the impact of lower loan originations, which have been negatively impacted by the increase in interest rates. Included in loan servicing fees is recognition of a change in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, which in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 resulted in a benefit of $131,000, as compared to a benefit of $348,000 in the same period a year ago. Deposit account charges and related fees decreased by $116,000, or 5.5%, compared to the same period a year ago, due primarily to reduced non-sufficient funds charges as a result of policy changes effective early in fiscal 2024, exempting certain NSF presentments from charges.\n\nNoninterest expense for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, was $25.0 million, an increase of $127,000, or 0.5%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase as compared to the year-ago period was primarily attributable to increases in compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment, and foreclosed property expenses. Partially offsetting these increases from the prior year period were decreases in other noninterest expense, data processing, deposit insurance premiums, postage and office supplies, and telecommunication expenses. In the year ago period, direct charges totaling $829,000 were related to the Citizens Bank & Trust merger, with no comparable material charges in the current period. Acquisition expenses in the year ago period were reflected largely in data processing fees (including contract termination and data conversion fees), compensation and benefits, and other miscellaneous merger operating expenses. The increase in compensation and benefits expense was primarily a result of increased headcount and annual merit and cost of living increases. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased due to relocated facilities and equipment, maintenance and remodels, and associated depreciation expenses. Lastly, in the same period of the prior fiscal year, the Company recognized a recovery on the sale of foreclosed property, with no comparable recovery in the current period.\n\nThe efficiency ratio for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, was 58.3%, as compared to 55.1% in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The change was attributable primarily to lower net interest income and noninterest income during the current year period. As compared to the linked quarter, ended March 31, 2024, the efficiency ratio decreased by 2.9 percentage points, from 61.2%, due to an increase in net interest income resulting from net interest margin expansion, as well as an increase in noninterest income largely driven by tax credit investment benefits recognized, seasonal recognition of incentives under our electronic funds transfer agreements, a positive change in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, and recognition during the linked quarter of losses on the sale of AFS securities, with no comparable losses in the current period.\n\nThe income tax provision for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, was $3.4 million, a decrease of $509,000 or 12.9%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a decrease of net income before income taxes. The effective tax rate was unchanged at 20.2%.\n\n**Forward-Looking Information:**\n\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this press release may be deemed to be forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, including: potential adverse impacts to the economic conditions in the Company’s local market areas, other markets where the Company has lending relationships, or other aspects of the Company’s business operations or financial markets, generally, resulting from the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and any governmental or societal responses thereto; expected cost savings, synergies and other benefits from our merger and acquisition activities might not be realized to the extent expected, within the anticipated time frames, or at all, and costs or difficulties relating to integration matters, including but not limited to customer and employee retention and labor shortages, might be greater than expected; the strength of the United States economy in general and the strength of local economies in which we conduct operations; fluctuations in interest rates and the possibility of a recession; monetary and fiscal policies of the FRB and the U.S. Government and other governmental initiatives affecting the financial services industry; the risks of lending and investing activities, including changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses; our ability to access cost-effective funding; the timely development of and acceptance of our new products and services and the perceived overall value of these products and services by users, including the features, pricing and quality compared to competitors' products and services; fluctuations in real estate values in both residential and commercial real estate markets, as well as agricultural business conditions; demand for loans and deposits; legislative or regulatory changes that adversely affect our business; changes in accounting principles, policies, or guidelines; results of regulatory examinations, including the possibility that a regulator may, among other things, require an increase in our reserve for loan losses or write-down of assets; the impact of technological changes; and our success at managing the risks involved in the foregoing.

(“Company”) (NASDAQ: SMBC), the parent corporation of Southern Bank (“Bank”), today announced preliminary net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 of $11.3 million, an increase of $8.9 million or 369%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was attributable primarily to the Citizens Bancshares, Co., Kansas City, Missouri (“Citizens”) merger related charges that reduced earnings in the prior year period. The merger related charges in the March 31, 2023, quarter included noninterest expense of $3.3 million and provision for credit losses (“PCL”) on the acquired loan portfolio and off-balance sheet credit exposures totaling $7.0 million. Inclusive of these non-recurring charges, the increase in net income was the result of decreases in PCL and non-interest expense, and an increase in net interest income, partially offset by a decrease in non-interest income and an increase in provision for income taxes. Preliminary net income was $0.99 per fully diluted common share for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, an increase of $0.77 as compared to the $0.22 per fully diluted common share reported for the same period of the prior fiscal year. The March 31, 2023, after-tax impact of non-recurring merger-related charges reduced the comparable quarter’s diluted earnings per share by $0.73. \n\n**Highlights for the third quarter of fiscal 2024:**\n\n  * Earnings per common share (diluted) were $0.99, up $0.77, or 350%, as compared to the same quarter a year ago, and down $0.08, or 7.5% from the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the linked quarter. \n  * Annualized return on average assets (“ROA”) was 0.97%, while annualized return on average common equity (“ROE”) was 9.5%, as compared to 0.23% and 2.3%, respectively, in the same quarter a year ago, and 1.07% and 10.6%, respectively, in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the linked quarter. The after-tax impact of the “Day 1” PCL and noninterest expense attributable directly to the Citizens merger were estimated to reduce ROA by 77 basis points, and ROE by 7.8 percentage points in the same quarter a year ago.\n  * During the current quarter, the Bank sold bonds with a book value of $18.4 million, recognizing a loss of $807,000 in noninterest income. These proceeds were reinvested into $18.0 million in higher yielding fixed rate securities, which is expected to result in an earn back of the realized loss in under two years. Recognition of this loss during the quarter reduced after-tax net income by $626,000, earnings per diluted share by $0.06, and ROA by five basis points. \n  * Net interest margin for the quarter was 3.15%, as compared to 3.48% reported for the year ago period, and down from 3.25% reported for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the linked quarter. Net interest income increased $742,000, or 2.2% compared to the same quarter a year ago, and increased $23,000, or 0.1% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the linked quarter.\n  * Noninterest expense was down 7.2% for the current quarter, as compared to the same quarter a year ago, primarily as a result of the one-time merger expenses associated with the January 2023 merger with Citizens, and up 5.0% from the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the linked quarter. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, there were no material charges attributable to merger activity, as compared to $3.3 million in the same quarter a year ago. \n  * Gross loan balances as of March 31, 2024, increased by $39.3 million as compared to December 31, 2023, and by $291.0 million as compared to March 31, 2023. \n  * Deposit balances increased by $612,000 as compared to December 31, 2023, and by $240.3 million as compared to March 31, 2023. \n  * Cash equivalent balances as of March 31, 2024, decreased by $48.3 million as compared to December 31, 2023, and increased by $53.0 million as compared to March 31, 2023. Although cash balances were lower at quarter end compared to the linked quarter, levels during the current quarter remained elevated with average interest bearing cash balances totaling $182.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, up $93.3 million compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2023, and up $55.5 million as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year.\n  * Modest repurchase activity of the Company’s common stock occurred in the third fiscal quarter, which totaled 4,438 shares acquired at an average price of $42.04 per share, or 99% of March 31, 2024, book value of $42.41.\n\n\n\n**Dividend Declared:**\n\nThe Board of Directors, on April 23, 2024, declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $0.21, payable May 31, 2024, to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 15, 2024, marking the 120th consecutive quarterly dividend since the inception of the Company. The Board of Directors and management believe the payment of a quarterly cash dividend enhances stockholder value and demonstrates our commitment to and confidence in our future prospects.\n\n**Conference Call:**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call to review the information provided in this press release on Tuesday, April 30, 2024, at 9:30 a.m., central time. The call will be available live to interested parties by calling 1-833-470-1428 in the United States and from all other locations. Participants should use participant access code 296074. Telephone playback will be available beginning one hour following the conclusion of the call through May 5, 2024. The playback may be accessed in the United States and all locations by dialing 1-866-813-9403, and using the conference passcode 583973.\n\n**Balance Sheet Summary:**\n\nThe Company experienced balance sheet growth in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, with total assets of $4.6 billion at March 31, 2024, reflecting an increase of $286.8 million, or 6.6%, as compared to June 30, 2023. Growth primarily reflected an increase in net loans receivable, cash equivalents, and available for sale (AFS) securities.\n\nCash and cash equivalents were a combined $168.8 million at March 31, 2024, an increase of $113.5 million, or 205.6%, as compared to June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of strong deposit generation that outpaced loan growth during the period. AFS securities were $433.7 million at March 31, 2024, up $16.1 million, or 3.9%, as compared to June 30, 2023.\n\nLoans, net of the allowance for credit losses (“ACL\"), were $3.7 billion at March 31, 2024, an increase of $148.8 million, or 4.2%, as compared to June 30, 2023. Gross loans increased by $152.3 million, while the ACL attributable to outstanding loan balances increased $3.5 million, or 7.4%, as compared to June 30, 2023. The increase in loan balances was attributable to growth in non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, residential real estate loans, multi-family, and drawn construction loan balances. This was partially offset by pay-offs and paydowns in owner-occupied commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans.\n\nLoans anticipated to fund in the next 90 days totaled $117.2 million at March 31, 2024, as compared to $140.5 million at December 31, 2023, and $164.4 million at March 31, 2023.\n\nThe Bank’s concentration in non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans is estimated at 329.3% of Tier 1 capital and ACL on March 31, 2024, as compared to 330.2% as of June 30, 2023, with these loans representing 42.6% of total loans at March 31, 2024. Multi-family residential real estate, hospitality (hotels/restaurants), care facilities, retail stand-alone, and strip centers are the most common collateral types within the non-owner occupied commercial real estate loan portfolio. The multi-family residential real estate loan portfolio commonly includes loans collateralized by properties currently in the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) program or having exited the program. The hospitality and retail stand-alone segments include primarily franchised businesses; care facilities consist mainly of skilled nursing and assisted living centers; and the strip centers can be defined as non-mall shopping centers with a variety of tenants. Non-owner occupied office property types included 36 loans totaling $27.2 million, or 0.72% of total loans at March 31, 2024, none of which were adversely classified as of March 31, 2024, and are generally comprised of smaller spaces with diverse tenants. The Company continues to monitor its commercial real estate concentration and the individual segments closely.\n\nNonperforming loans were $7.4 million, or 0.20% of gross loans, at March 31, 2024, as compared to $7.7 million, or 0.21% of gross loans at June 30, 2023. Nonperforming assets were $11.3 million, or 0.24% of total assets, at March 31, 2024, as compared to $11.3 million, or 0.26% of total assets, at June 30, 2023.\n\nOur ACL at March 31, 2024, totaled $51.3 million, representing 1.36% of gross loans and 693% of nonperforming loans, as compared to an ACL of $47.8 million, representing 1.32% of gross loans and 625% of nonperforming loans at June 30, 2023. The Company has estimated its expected credit losses as of March 31, 2024, under ASC 326-20, and management believes the ACL as of that date was adequate based on that estimate. There remains, however, significant economic uncertainty as the Federal Reserve has materially tightened monetary policy to address inflation. Management continues to closely monitor, in particular, borrowers in the hotel industry that were slow to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTotal liabilities were $4.2 billion at March 31, 2024, an increase of $253.3 million, or 6.5%, as compared to June 30, 2023. Growth primarily reflected an increase in total deposits and other liabilities from the increase of accrued interest payable and income taxes payable. These increases in liabilities were partially offset by a decrease in FHLB advances.\n\nDeposits were $4.0 billion at March 31, 2024, an increase of $270.0 million, or 7.2%, as compared to June 30, 2023. The deposit portfolio saw year-to-date increases in certificates of deposit and savings accounts, as customers remained willing to move balances into high yield savings accounts and special rate time deposits in the higher rate environment. Public unit balances totaled $624.5 million at March 31, 2024, an increase of $46.0 million compared to June 30, 2023, and increased $30.4 million from December 31, 2023, the linked quarter, reflecting seasonal trends. Brokered deposits totaled $187.0 million at March 31, 2024, an increase of $27.3 million as compared to June 30, 2023, but a decrease of $13.6 million compared to December 31, 2023, the linked quarter. The average loan-to-deposit ratio for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was 92.5%, as compared to 95.8% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, and 91.2% for the same period of the prior fiscal year. The table below illustrates changes in deposit balances by type over recent periods:\n\n**Summary Deposit Data as of:**| **Mar. 31,**| **Dec. 31,**| **Sep. 30,**| **June 30,**| **Mar. 31,**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_| **2024**| **2023**| **2023**| **2023**| **2023**  \nNon-interest bearing deposits| $| 525,959| $| 534,194| $| 583,353| $| 597,600| $| 618,598  \nNOW accounts| 1,300,358| 1,304,371| 1,231,005| 1,328,423| 1,430,019  \nMMDAs - non-brokered| 359,569| 378,578| 415,115| 439,652| 448,616  \nBrokered MMDAs| 10,084| 20,560| 20,272| 13,076| 6  \nSavings accounts| 455,212| 372,824| 313,135| 282,753| 304,663  \nTotal nonmaturity deposits| 2,651,182| 2,610,527| 2,562,880| 2,661,504| 2,801,902  \nCertificates of deposit - non-brokered| 1,167,461| 1,204,391| 1,075,563| 917,489| 855,436  \nBrokered certificates of deposit| 176,867| 179,980| 202,683| 146,547| 97,855  \nTotal certificates of deposit| 1,344,328| 1,384,371| 1,278,246| 1,064,036| 953,291  \nTotal deposits| $| 3,995,510| $| 3,994,898| $| 3,841,126| $| 3,725,540| $| 3,755,193  \nPublic unit nonmaturity accounts| $| 572,631| $| 544,873| $| 491,868| $| 523,164| $| 584,400  \nPublic unit certficates of deposit| 51,834| 49,237| 52,989| 55,344| 52,212  \nTotal public unit deposits| $| 624,465| $| 594,110| $| 544,857| $| 578,508| $| 636,612  \n  \nFHLB advances were $102.0 million at March 31, 2024, a decrease of $31.5 million, or 23.6%, as compared to June 30, 2023, as the Company utilized deposit growth to repay overnight and maturing FHLB advances. For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company continued to have no FHLB overnight borrowings.\n\nThe Company’s stockholders’ equity was $479.6 million at March 31, 2024, an increase of $33.5 million, or 7.5%, as compared to June 30, 2023. The increase was attributable primarily to earnings retained after cash dividends paid, in combination with a $2.9 million reduction in accumulated other comprehensive losses (“AOCL”) due to losses recognized on the sale of AFS securities and as the market value of the Company’s investments appreciated during the fiscal year to date due to the tightening of interest rate spreads. The AOCL totaled $19.1 million at March 31, 2024, compared $21.9 million at June 30, 2023. The Company does not hold any securities classified as held-to-maturity. The increase in stockholders’ equity was partially offset by $187,000 utilized for repurchases of 4,438 shares of the Company’s common stock during the third fiscal quarter of 2024 at an average price of $42.04 per share.\n\n**Quarterly Income Statement Summary:**\n\nThe Company’s net interest income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, was $34.5 million, an increase of $742,000, or 2.2%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was attributable to a 12.8% increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets in the current three-month period compared to the same period a year ago, partially offset by a decrease of 33 basis points in the net interest margin. The primary driver of the net interest margin decline, compared to the year ago period, was the yield on interest earning assets increasing 87 basis points, while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased 139 basis points.\n\nLoan discount accretion and deposit premium amortization related to the Company’s June 2017 acquisition of Capaha Bank, the February 2018 acquisition of Southern Missouri Bank of Marshfield, the November 2018 acquisition of First Commercial Bank, the May 2020 acquisition of Central Federal Savings & Loan Association, the February 2022 merger of FortuneBank, and the January 2023 acquisition of Citizens Bank & Trust resulted in $1.2 million in net interest income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, as compared to $1.4 million in net interest income for the same period a year ago. Combined, this component of net interest income contributed 11 basis points to net interest margin in the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, as compared to a 14 basis point contribution for the same period of the prior fiscal year, and as compared to a 14 basis point contribution in the linked quarter, ended December 31, 2023, when net interest margin was 3.25%.\n\nThe Company recorded a PCL of $900,000 in the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, as compared to a PCL of $10.1 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The current period PCL was the result of a $1.4 million provision attributable to the ACL for loan balances outstanding, partially offset by a recovery of $458,000 in provision attributable to the allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures, as construction draws reduced available credit and increased on-balance sheet exposure. The comparable period PCL was elevated primarily due to the Citizens merger. The Company’s assessment of the economic outlook was little changed as compared to the assessment as of June 30, 2023, but reserves were modestly increased due to qualitative factors and individually evaluated credits, slightly expanding the ACL as a percentage of total loans. As a percentage of average loans outstanding, the Company recorded net charge offs of one basis point (annualized) during the current period, unchanged from the same period of the prior fiscal year.\n\nThe Company’s noninterest income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, was $5.6 million, a decrease of $700,000, or 11.1%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease was attributable to recognized losses on the sale of AFS securities, which totaled $807,000 in the current quarter, with no AFS gains or losses recognized in the same quarter a year ago, along with lower other noninterest income and insurance brokerage commissions. These items were partially offset by increased wealth management fees, other loan fees, and earnings on bank owned life insurance.\n\nNoninterest expense for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, was $25.0 million, a decrease of $1.9 million, or 7.2%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease as compared to the year-ago period was primarily attributable to charges directly related to merger and acquisition activities, which totaled $3.3 million in the year-ago period from the Citizens acquisition, with no material charges in the current period. Direct charges related to merger and acquisition activity in the year-ago period were primarily legal and professional fees, data processing fees (including contract termination and data conversion fees), compensation expenses, marketing activities, and other miscellaneous merger operating expenses. Partially offsetting these decreases from the prior year period were increases in occupancy and equipment, deposit insurance premiums, advertising, and intangible amortization. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased due to additional facilities and equipment; maintenance and remodels; and associated depreciation expenses, reflecting the additional facilities resulting from the Citizens merger. The increase in deposit insurance premiums was primarily due to the increase in deposits compared to the same period of the prior year. Advertising enhancements in the current quarter increased marketing expenses compared to the March 31, 2023 quarter. Lastly, compared to the same period last year, intangible amortization expense increased as last year’s same period only included two months following the Citizens acquisition.\n\nThe efficiency ratio for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, was 61.2%, as compared to 67.4% in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The change was attributable to higher net interest income in combination with lower noninterest expenses during the current year period. The efficiency ratio in the current quarter compared to the linked quarter, ended December 31, 2023, increased 2.78 percentage points from 58.5%, due to an increase in non-interest expense. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in compensation related to annual merit increases; advertising expenses; and occupancy and equipment expense.\n\nThe income tax provision for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, was $2.8 million, an increase of 390.8%, as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily attributed to higher pre-tax earnings after the acquisition of Citizens.\n\n**Forward-Looking Information:**\n\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this press release may be deemed to be forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, including: potential adverse impacts to the economic conditions in the Company’s local market areas, other markets where the Company has lending relationships, or other aspects of the Company’s business operations or financial markets, generally, resulting from the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and any governmental or societal responses thereto; expected cost savings, synergies and other benefits from our merger and acquisition activities might not be realized to the extent anticipated, within the anticipated time frames, or at all, and costs or difficulties relating to integration matters, including but not limited to customer and employee retention and labor shortages, might be greater than expected; the strength of the United States economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which we conduct operations; fluctuations in interest rates and the possibility of a recession; monetary and fiscal policies of the FRB and the U.S. Government and other governmental initiatives affecting the financial services industry; the risks of lending and investing activities, including changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses; our ability to access cost-effective funding; the timely development of and acceptance of our new products and services and the perceived overall value of these products and services by users, including the features, pricing and quality compared to competitors' products and services; fluctuations in real estate values and both residential and commercial real estate markets, as well as agricultural business conditions; demand for loans and deposits; legislative or regulatory changes that adversely affect our business; changes in accounting principles, policies, or guidelines; results of regulatory examinations, including the possibility that a regulator may, among other things, require an increase in our reserve for loan losses or write-down of assets; the impact of technological changes; and our success at managing the risks involved in the foregoing.
