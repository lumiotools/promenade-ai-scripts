(\"Borealis\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: BRLS), a food-tech innovator, and creator of the popular high-protein Chef Woo ramen, Ramen Express and Woodles brand of noodles, today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n[ ![Borealis Foods Inc. is an innovative food technology company with a mission to address global food security challenges by developing highly nutritious and functional food products with great flavor that are both affordable and sustainable. \\(CNW Group/Borealis Foods, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2558527/Borealis_Foods__Inc__Borealis_Foods_Reports_Third_Quarter_2024_F.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2558527/Borealis_Foods__Inc__Borealis_Foods_Reports_Third_Quarter_2024_F.html)\n\n**Financial & Business Highlights**\n\n  * Third quarter net sales of $7.7 million, compared with $5.3 in Q2 2024, representing improvement of over 45% from $5.3 million.\n  * Gross margin of 17% more than doubled from 8% in the second quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP gross margin, which excludes depreciation of the Company's manufacturing plant, reached 23% in the third quarter, compared with 15% in Q2 of 2024.\n  * On a year-over-year basis, gross margin of 17% in the third quarter was improved from (6)% a year ago. Improving gross margin, both sequentially and from the prior year, was driven by the Company's focus on shifting its product mix to Chef Woo and Woodles, which are premium brand products.\n  * As a result of the factors cited above, third quarter gross profit grew to $1.3 million, more than tripling from $0.4 million in the second quarter.\n  * The Company continued to drive its national expansion, centered on its flagship Chef Woo brand, with the addition of key Walmart locations announced subsequent to Q3, bringing the total retail store count to over 23,000 in the US and Canada.\n  * Began full-scale shipments of Woodles to schools during the third quarter, marking a successful initial rollout with further expansion expected in the fourth quarter and into 2025.\n  * Launched in late Q2, Woodles gained immediate market acceptance. Together with Chef Woo, the two premium product lines accounted for approximately 39% of third quarter revenue.\n  * Subsequent to Q3, Borealis announced an agreement for its Palmetto Gourmet Foods subsidiary to be the exclusive US ramen manufacturing partner for a leading, global food conglomerate. The partnership is expected to begin contributing revenue in Q1 2025.\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\nBorealis CEO Reza Soltanzadeh commented, \"The third quarter of 2024 marked an important inflection point for our company as our business development initiatives began delivering additional revenue streams while our focus on optimizing our sales mix helped drive continued gross margin expansion. A key focus during the quarter was improving our business mix as we devoted more shelf space to our Chef Woo line of products and began deliveries of Woodles. That work led to a healthy expansion of our non-GAAP gross margin to 23%. While that is an achievement our team can be proud of, we have ample room to continue expanding our margins.\"\n\nMr. Soltanzadeh added, \"A key aspect of our strategy has been the development of a proper foundation for success, highlighted by our world-class manufacturing facility in Saluda, South Carolina, with substantial capacity for growth. Having our manufacturing here in the US is a significant advantage for our company as it qualifies us to provide products for the USDA, which oversees public school lunch programs across the country and was a key factor in our successful Woodles rollout this quarter. We are looking forward to building on that success as we expand Woodles to more schools in the fourth quarter and into 2025. We are also busy working on other, similar opportunities such as hospitals, correctional facilities, and universities.\"\n\nMr. Soltanzadeh noted, \"In our retail sales channel, we also recently announced an expansion of our partnership with Walmart that will see our ramen products carried at many of their best-performing stores. That announcement highlighted two exciting new ramen flavors developed by our brand ambassador Gordon Ramsay, which consumers are sure to love. We expect those new flavors – Black Garlic Beef and Shiitake Mushroom Chicken – to really set Chef Woo apart from the other 'run of the mill' ramen in stores. Importantly, these are just the first two of a regular cadence of exciting new recipes and flavors from Gordon.\"\n\nMr. Soltanzadeh further added, \"As we pursue our mission to build a leading food tech company, we have focused on pioneering food science and innovation that will enable us to continue introducing new products to the market. That commitment was highlighted by our announcement in September of a Texas Tech University study which revealed that a meal containing Chef Woo's high-protein ramen noodles significantly reduced caloric intake at the next meal. We are very proud of this result as it validates the hard work of everyone on our team while providing a foundation for further studies and future products. Our technology and platform enable continuous innovation and consumer product development.\"\n\nMr. Soltanzadeh concluded, \"We expect sequential sales growth in the fourth quarter driven by several factors. First, as the weather turns colder, sales of soup and similar products such as ramen normally see a seasonal boost in consumption. Second, we expect our further rollout with Walmart and the new flavors developed by Gordon Ramsay to stimulate additional sales. Lastly, we continue to expand our Woodles penetration in schools across the US. Driving sales of Chef Woo and Woodles products is a key focus for our team and as we do so, we expect gross margins to continue to increase, resulting in continued bottom-line improvement in the fourth quarter and in 2025. We are enthusiastic about Borealis' long-term growth prospects and look forward to reporting on the Company's developments.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results Detail:**\n\n  * Net revenues of $7.7 million, compared with $5.3 million in Q2 as the Company focused on driving sales of higher margin Chef Woo and Woodles items which together accounted for 39% of sales.\n  * Gross profit of $1.3 million, compared with $0.4 million in the second quarter and a gross loss of $(0.5) million in the year-ago period. Gross margin of 17%, improved from 8% in the second quarter and (6)% in the year ago period, with the improvement in both gross profit dollars and margin due to solid execution of the Company's strategy to shift product mix in favor of higher margin items.\n  * Non-GAAP gross profit of $1.8 million, compared with $0.8 million in the second quarter. Non-GAAP gross profit excludes depreciation expense of $0.5 million and $0.4 million in the third and second quarters respectively.\n  * SG&A expense of $4.9 million, compared with $5.6 million during the second quarter of 2024, as the Company streamlined its investment in business development, expanded distribution, influencer marketing programs, and incurred public company expenses. Spending on distribution expansion, such as support for Woodles, coupled with sales and marketing, including online and in-store promotions, represented strategic investment designed to drive revenue growth in current and future periods.\n  * Interest expense of $1.2 million was relatively unchanged from $1.1 million in the second quarter. Interest expense levels continued to be lower than in the year ago period due to the conversion of convertible notes in conjunction with the Company's business combination completed during the first quarter of 2024.\n  * Net loss of $(4.8) million, improved from a net loss of $(6.3) million in the second quarter due to the combination of increased revenues and improvement in gross margins.\n  * Financial position: as of September 30, 2024, the Company had $0.7 million of cash on hand and $3.5 million of borrowing capacity available on its revolving credit facility. Anticipated sales growth and margin expansion are expected to drive improving operating cash flow to support ongoing operations.\n\n\n\n**Borealis Foods Inc. and Subsidiaries****Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations****(Unaudited)**\n\n**For the Three Months Ended** | **For the Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30, 2024** | **September 30, 2023** | **September 30, 2024** | **September 30, 2023**  \nGross sales | $ | 8,075,788 | $ | 8,264,745 | $ | 22,036,285 | $ | 23,870,009  \nSales discounts & allowances | (387,889) | (539,392) | (1,127,673) | (1,342,799)  \nRevenue, net | 7,687,899 | 7,725,353 | 20,908,612 | 22,527,210  \nCost of goods sold | 5,953,089 | 7,205,527 | 17,109,095 | 21,449,469  \nDepreciation | 461,540 | 996,625 | 1,861,351 | 2,938,098  \nTotal cost of goods sold | 6,414,629 | 8,202,152 | 18,970,446 | 24,387,567  \n**Gross profit (loss)** | **1,273,270** | **(476,799)** | **1,938,166** | **(1,860,357)**  \nSales and marketing | 1,123,460 | 312,289 | 5,073,810 | 1,677,316  \nBusiness development | 1,306,589 | 196,243 | 2,475,764 | 435,015  \nTraining | 477,752 | 651,500 | 1,364,149 | 2,130,207  \nGeneral and administrative expenses | 1,986,517 | 2,786,155 | 8,807,852 | 9,332,345  \nTotal SG&A Expenses | 4,894,318 | 3,946,187 | 17,721,575 | 13,574,883  \n**Loss from operations** | **(3,621,048)** | **(4,422,986)** | **(15,783,409)** | **(15,435,240)**  \nOther income (expense):   \n(Loss) Gain on foreign exchange rates | (2,765) | 4,298 | 3,368 | 163,588  \nInterest expense | (1,207,524) | (2,166,413) | (3,766,542) | (5,535,932)  \nTotal other expense | (1,210,289) | (2,162,115) | (3,763,174) | (5,372,344)  \n**Loss before income taxes** | **(4,831,337)** | **(6,585,101)** | **(19,546,583)** | **(20,807,584)**  \nIncome tax expense | (832) | 0 | (14,948) | (15,092)  \n**Net loss** | **$** | **(4,832,169)** | **$** | **(6,585,101)** | **$** | **(19,561,531)** | **$** | **(20,822,676)**  \nEarnings per share from net loss  \nBasic | $ | (0.23) | $ | (0.61) | $ | (0.98) | $ | (1.94)  \nDiluted | $ | **(0.23)** | $ | **(0.61)** | $ | **(0.98)** | $ | **(1.94)**  \nWeighted average shares outstanding  \nBasic | 21,378,890 | 10,731,583 | 19,951,016 | 10,731,583  \nDiluted | 21,378,890 | 10,731,583 | 19,951,016 | 10,731,583  \n  \n**Borealis Foods Inc. and Subsidiaries****Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets**\n\n**September 30, 2024** | **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---  \n**(Unaudited)**  \n**Assets**  \nCurrent Assets  \nCash | $ | 721,542 | $ | 7,615,630  \nAccounts receivable, net | 2,907,790 | 1,775,756  \nInventories, net | 8,750,399 | 6,945,028  \nPrepaid expenses | 1,048,029 | 845,878  \nTotal current assets | **13,427,760** | **17,182,292**  \nProperty, plant and equipment, net | 46,066,397 | 46,408,540  \nIntangible assets | 253,017 | —  \nRight -

While these items may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends as these items can vary significantly from period to period depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may occur. Therefore, while we may incur or recognize these types of expenses and gains in the future, we believe that removing these items for purposes of calculating the Adjusted EBITDA financial measures provides a more focused presentation of our ongoing operating performance.\n\nWe view EBITDA as an important indicator of performance. We define EBITDA as net income/(loss) plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA further adjusted for any foreign exchange gains/(losses), share-based compensation expense and non-recurring items if identified. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures utilized by our management and other users of our financial statements such as investors, research analysts and others, to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis. Adjusted EBITDA is a key performance measure that our management uses to assess its operating performance. We facilitate internal comparisons of our operating performance on a more consistent basis. We use these performance measures for business planning purposes and forecasting. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA enhances an investor's understanding of our financial performance as they are useful in assessing our operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business.\n\n_Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA_  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended** | **Nine Months Ended**  \n**Sept 30,** | **June 30,**  \n**_(in thousands)_** | **2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nNet income (loss) | $ | (4,832) | $ | (6,585) | $ | (19,562) | $ | (20,823)  \nPlus: Taxes | (1) | 0 | 15 | 15  \nPlus: Depreciation and amortization | 472 | 997 | 1,861 | 2,938  \nPlus: Loss on disposal | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0  \nPlus: Interest expense | 1,208 | 2,166 | 3,767 | 5,536  \n**EBITDA** | **(3,153)** | **(3,422)** | **(13,919)** | **(12,334)**  \nPlus: non-recurring expenses  \nMarketing | 1,123 | 312 | 5,074 | 1,677  \nOne time crew training | 477 | 652 | 1,364 | 2,130  \nStock compensation | 0 | 100 | 1,273 | 392  \nTransaction costs | 263 | 1,241 | 1,770 | 4,005  \nProduct development expenses | 1,307 | 196 | 2,477 | 435  \nTotal non-recurring expenses | 3,170 | 2,501 | 11,958 | 8,639  \n**Adjusted EBITDA** | **$** | **17** | **$** | **(921)** | **$** | **(1,961)** | **$** | **(3,695)**  \n  \n**About Borealis Foods**\n\nBorealis Foods (NASDAQ: BRLS) is a pioneering, integrated food manufacturing company with a mission to disrupt and elevate the ready-to-eat meal and dry soup categories by offering premium and super-premium, nutritious products.
