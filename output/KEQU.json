          "content": "ANNUAL\nSHAREHOLDER\nSPEECH\nAUGUST 28, 2024\nKewaunee Scientific Corporation\nAnnual Shareholder Speech\nAugust 28, 2024\nGood morning. I would like to extend a warm welcome to our shareholders who have set\naside time to join us today at Kewaunee’s 2024 annual shareholder meeting. This year’s\nmeeting is again being conducted virtually, providing our shareholders with a more\naccessible format in which to participate.\nBefore proceeding, a brief comment regarding forward-looking statements.\nAdditionally, please see the notice regarding any non-GAAP measures included in today’s\nfinancial review.\nToday, I will share with you highlights from our recently completed fiscal year, ended April\n30, 2024, as well as an update on our outlook and strategic direction.\nThere will be time for questions at the end of the presentation, and we will take as many as\npossible. If you are logged in as a shareholder and have questions, you may submit them\nonline during the presentation. Finally, all materials will be posted to the investor information\nsection of our website for future reference.\nKewaunee is the leading designer and manufacturer of laboratory-grade technical furniture\nand ventilated products, with over 1,000 Associates serving customers across North and\nSouth America, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.\nKewaunee's journey first began in 1906 in Kewaunee, Wisconsin, as a manufacturer of\ncaskets and other wood-based products. In time, the Company transitioned its focus to the\nlaboratory, developing a line of products that were used to furnish spaces focused on\nresearch and development, which was beginning to be prioritized by both the public and\nprivate sectors.\nOver time, Kewaunee shifted its manufacturing footprint to Statesville, North Carolina and\nestablished operations in burgeoning international markets. The Company’s unique set of\ncapabilities, developed over the course of its history, has allowed it to endure multiple\neconomic cycles with resiliency.\nThe innate human desire for progress and quest for innovation have resulted in tremendous\ndiscoveries over the past two centuries, propelling society forward. This momentum has then\ndriven the need for scientific spaces equipped with the highest quality, laboratory-grade\nfurniture and equipment. More specifically, these spaces require the types of technical\nfurniture that Kewaunee designs and manufactures.\nAs our society’s needs progress and laboratories continue to evolve, Kewaunee remains\ndedicated to creating amazing spaces that will drive advancements in diverse fields and\nshape the future of scientific exploration worldwide.\nThe first laboratory spaces began to take shape in the 15th and 16th centuries with simple\nrooms equipped with basic tools and materials. These labs were often small and cluttered\nwith furniture and equipment. While the concept of wooden benches emerged during this\ntime, there was no focus on ergonomic design, and containment devices and other technical\nequipment had yet to be discovered.\nOur modern concept of laboratory space began to take shape in universities and research\ninstitutions during the 18th and 19th centuries, with larger and more specialized labs that\nfeatured specific areas for different types of experiments. Specialized furniture, such as lab\nbenches and fume hoods, became common features, supporting the development of new\nscientific instruments like microscopes and telescopes.\nIn the early 20th century, there were still relatively few laboratories in industry, and the United\nStates depended on Germany and England for the bulk of its scientific furniture and\nequipment. The country’s entry into World War I placed tremendous importance on scientific\nand technological development, leading to significant focus on advancements in the\nlaboratory space over the next several decades.\nAs we fast-forward to today, we see that laboratories are now spaces meant to inspire and\nfoster collaboration. These labs are designed to be efficient and cross-functional, with open\nfloor plans and adaptable furniture that allow for easy reconfiguration to meet changing\nneeds.\nTechnological advancements have also taken center stage, with automated robotic\nequipment and computer simulations becoming integral to research. As more investments\nhave been poured into these kinds of spaces, modern labs have evolved beyond basic\nfunctionality to become dynamic arenas where discoveries are made, ideas are exchanged,\nand innovation thrives – making them truly amazing spaces!\nAt Kewaunee, we believe in empowering the scientific community with spaces that inspire,\ninnovate, and integrate. Serving the forefront of life sciences, education, healthcare,\nindustrial, petrochemical, and government research, we deliver unparalleled laboratory\nenvironments tailored for every research and development endeavor.\nOur customers operate within multiple end-use markets that require high-quality laboratory\nfurniture and technical products to furnish their environments. These markets tend to enjoy\na durable, long-term growth trend with consistent funding from private and public parties,\ndriving demand for Kewaunee's products.\nInvestment in research and development continues to be a tailwind fueling the global\neconomy's pursuit of progress. Global R&D expenditures have tripled from an estimated\n$726 billion in 2000 to an estimated $2.5 trillion in 2022. Increased investment in discovery\nhas been a key driver of global progress, and R&D spending is expected to rise as\ntechnological advancements fuel new research.\nAccording to the 2023 Lab Furniture and Enclosures Report published periodically by SEFA,\nthe market for laboratory technical furniture remains robust and is expected to grow as\nglobal investment in these special spaces continues.\nWith this understanding of where this industry once was and where it is expected to go,\nKewaunee is well-positioned as the brand of choice and market leader when furnishing\ntoday’s amazing laboratory spaces.\nWe maintain this position by having what I believe are the best Associates and channel\npartners in the business. Together, we serve end-use customers in highly attractive, well-\nfunded industries that are set to continue investing in spaces that require Kewaunee’s\nproducts and services.\nFiscal year 2024 was a tremendous year for Kewaunee.\nThough down year over year, sales remained strong, reflecting consistent demand for\nKewaunee’s products and services. Domestic sales during the fiscal year reflects a reduction\nin non-product revenue related to the Company’s decision to stop selling directly to end\nusers. This revenue typically included freight, installation services, and buyouts. The year-\nover-year decrease in International sales was largely driven by a single large project\ndelivered during the prior fiscal year in Africa that was non-recurring. While sales did\ndecrease year over year due to the reasons I just discussed, year-end retained earnings and\nEBITDA generation exceeded the company’s previous high watermark set in 2018, and the\nCompany’s order backlog maintained its exceptional health through year-end.\nStrategic capital continued to be deployed within the business to upgrade obsolete\nequipment and improve existing capabilities, and the Company’s balance sheet improved\ngreatly with a substantial increase in our cash position and the successful termination of the\n2005 frozen pension plan.\nThese outstanding results coincided with realizing the benefits of multiple strategic\ndecisions made in recent years to create a more specialized focus for the Company. The\nmarket recognized these results as the year progressed, leading to a significant increase in\nthe Company’s stock price and market capitalization, rewarding you, our shareholder.\nOver the past few years, we have made and executed a series of decisions to invest in our\ncore competency as a designer and manufacturer of high-quality laboratory furniture and\ntechnical products.\nWe first transitioned multiple markets where we historically contracted with customers on a\ndirect basis to our dealer network. In doing so, we strengthened our relationships with our\ndealers, who are serving these territories at a high level, increasing our market share in these\nregions.\nSecond, we prioritized capital deployment within our manufacturing facilities, upgrading\nseveral aged pieces of equipment. These decisions resulted in the incredible results detailed\nwithin our press release dated June 26, 2024, and discussed in our full-year results as well\nas our Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on June 28, 2024.\nIn discussing these results, it’s important to note the impact of two transactions that are non-\nrecurring or one-time in nature that were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024.\nThe first was the annuitization of the Company’s pension obligation, which had been in a\nfrozen state since 2005. For much of the time since 2005, plan liabilities exceeded plan\nassets, requiring periodic funding and the recording of an unrealized loss on the Company's\nBalance Sheet. By annuitizing the pension obligation, the Company has eliminated all future\nresponsibility for the plan and will realize a reduction in costs associated with maintaining\nand managing the pension plan.\nThe second non-recurring adjustment was related to the partial release of the Company's\nvaluation allowance, which resulted in a one-time book tax benefit that increased net\nearnings for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.\nWe ended the fiscal year with a strong order backlog, and we continue to see solid bidding\nand quoting levels. Our backlog is further supported by the stability of the markets we serve\nand our dealer and distribution partners’ continued investment in their businesses.\nWe are not without challenges as inflation continues to roll through the economy, and we\nhave recently seen signs of material costs beginning to escalate again. The contracts that\nour channel partners have with their customers tend to be fixed in nature, with very little\nability to pass along rapid changes in costs. We are also very closely tied to the new\nconstruction industry, which tends to be cyclical, with periods of expansion and contraction.\nWe have enjoyed a period of strong global growth for lab spaces over the past few years.\nStill, there is always a risk that funding for these spaces will slow.\nWith that being said, the strength of our backlog, combined with our team’s proactive\nconcentration on the headwinds we face, positions the Company well for fiscal year 2025.\nOur vision for Kewaunee remains to be the global supplier of choice with customers in the\nlaboratory furniture and infrastructure markets. In pursuing this vision, we continue to follow\nthe principles that guide our actions:\n• We will be easy to do business with;\n• We will get closer to our customers;\n• We will do everything with excellence; and\n• We will lead and not follow (we are innovators).\nAs I close, I want to take a moment to thank the Company’s global Associates for their\ncommitment and hard work over the past year. I also want to thank our many loyal\ncustomers, dealers, and our national stocking distributor for their support.\nI would also like to thank our many shareholders for your continued support. Kewaunee's\nfuture is bright, and I am excited to continue building on our momentum in fiscal 2025.\nPlease note that Kewaunee will be releasing earnings for the first quarter of the Company’s\nfiscal year 2025 after the close of business on September 11, 2024.\nWe will now open the floor for questions.\nP.O.

Adjusted net earnings represent GAAP net earnings\nadjusted for net pension settlement expenses and the impact of a valuation allowance\nrelease. This financial information is not in accordance with, or an alternative fact for,\nGAAP-compliant financial information and may be different from the operating or non-\nGAAP financial information used by other companies. The Company believes that this\npresentation of adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share provides\nuseful information to investors regarding certain additional financial and business\ntrendsrelatingto itsfinancialconditionand resultsofoperations.\nEBITDA is calculated as net earnings (loss), less interest expense and interest income,\nincome taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as\nEBITDA less the impact of the one-time costs incurred for the pension termination\nenacted during FY24. We believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA allow management\nand investors to compare our performance to other companies on a consistent basis\nwithout regard to depreciation and amortization or the costs incurred related to our one-\ntime pension termination transaction executed during fiscal year 2024, which can vary\nsignificantly between companies depending upon many factors. EBITDA and Adjusted\nEBITDA are not calculations based upon generally accepted accounting principles, and\nthe method for calculating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA can vary among companies.\nThe amounts included in the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA calculations, however, are\nderived from amounts included in the historical consolidated statements of operations.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net earnings\n(loss) or operating earnings (loss) as an indicator of the Company’s operating\nperformance,or asanalternativetooperatingcashflows asa measure ofliquidity.\nKewaunee Scientific Corporation | NASDAQ: KEQU\n3\nIntroduction\nAgenda\nAnnual Shareholder Meeting\n• Kewaunee Scientific Overview\n• Fiscal Year 2024 Review\n• Strategic Direction and\nOutlook\n• Q&A\n4\nKewaunee Overview\n5\nKewaunee’s History\n6\nThe Human Spirit Driving Innovation Forward\nThe human desire to discover has fueled a century of remarkable progress.

Gardner III; 704-873-7202\n(Name and telephone number, including area code, of the person to contact in connection with this disclosure.)\nCheck the appropriate box to indicate the rule pursuant to which this form is being filed, and provide the period to\nwhich the information in this form applies:\n☒ Rule 13p-1 under the Securities Exchange Act (17CFR 240.13p-1) for the disclosure period from January 1 to\nDecember 31, 2023.\n☐ Rule 13q-1 under the Securities Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13q-1) for the fiscal year ended ____.\nSection 1 - Conflict Minerals Disclosure\nItem 1.01 Conflict Minerals Disclosure and Report\nKewaunee Scientific Corporation shares the concerns of Congress and the international business community that\nprofits from the mining of certain minerals (“3TGs,” as defined below) in the Democratic Republic of Congo or its\nadjoining countries may be aiding human rights abuses. The term “3TGs” refers to columbite-tantalite (coltan),\ncassiterite, gold, wolframite or their derivatives, which are limited to tantalum, tin and tungsten.\nWith respect to the calendar year ended December 31, 2023, we identified several of our products for which 3TGs\n(as defined above) may be present in and necessary to their functionality or production. Accordingly, we have\ndeveloped a conflict minerals procedure, as described below, reasonably designed to identify whether the 3TGs in\nthe Covered Products, if any, originated in the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country (the Republic\nof the Congo, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, Zambia or Angola)\n(the “Covered Countries”), or whether any of the 3TGs in the Covered Countries are from recycled or scrap sources.\nOn an annual basis, our product development team reviews a list of our significant vendors and identifies any\nvendors for which the materials we purchase may contain 3TGs. Through this process, we determined that several of\nour products may contain small traces of one or more 3TGs. As a result, we have established a process whereby we\nconduct a country-of-origin inquiry reasonably designed to determine whether 3TGs contained in or used to produce\nthese products, if any, originated in a Covered Country or were from recycled or scrap sources.\nDescription of the Company’s Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry\nTo determine the origin of any 3TGs, a survey was sent to all of our identified suppliers whose products may contain\nthem. The survey inquired about the origin of their 3TGs and whether they had a written policy for conflict-free\nsourcing of 3TGs, among other items. Responses received from the survey indicated that any 3TGs in materials\nprovided by our suppliers did not originate from the Covered Countries. In addition to the responses received from\nour suppliers, management has no reason to believe that any 3TGs in or used in the production of our Covered\nProducts may have originated in the Covered Countries.\nIf at any time we discover the use of any 3TGs originating from the Covered Countries, we will take appropriate\nmeasures to discontinue use of such materials or processes.\nThis information is also available on our website at www.kewaunee.com, as well as the SEC’s EDGAR database at\nwww.sec.gov.\nSignature\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this\ndisclosure to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.\nKEWAUNEE SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION\n(Registrant)\nDate: May 3, 2024 By /s/ Donald T. Gardner III\nDonald T. Gardner III\nVice President, Finance and\nChief Financial Officer"
