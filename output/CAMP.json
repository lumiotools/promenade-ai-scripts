With the proceeds from our IPO, we are well positioned to support continued clinical and preclinical development of our ongoing programs.”\n\n**Recent Corporate Highlights:**\n\n  * In October 2024, CAMP4 completed its IPO of 6,820,000 shares of its common stock at an initial public offering price of $11.00 per share. Aggregate gross proceeds to CAMP4 were approximately $75.0 million. The underwriters also partially exercised their option to purchase an additional 643,762 shares of common stock for total offering gross proceeds of $82.1 million.\n  * Entered strategic research collaboration agreement with BioMarin to leverage CAMP4’s RAP Platform™ to identify and advance regRNAs for rare genetic conditions. CAMP4 is eligible to receive upfront and milestone payments in addition to tiered royalties.\n  * The FDA granted RPDD and ODD to CMP-CPS-001 for the treatment of UCDs.\n  * Ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of CMP-CPS-001 in UCDs, with dosing completed for all SAD cohorts. The Phase 1 study is a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of CMP-CPS-001 in 96 healthy volunteers. The company anticipates reporting SAD safety data in the first quarter of 2025 followed by MAD safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic biomarker efficacy data in the second half of 2025.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nCAMP4 ended the third quarter with $2.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. On a pro forma basis, considering the $82.1M IPO proceeds, the company is well positioned to support continued growth and the development of its ongoing programs.\n\nResearch and Development (R&D) expenses were $9.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $9.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was mainly due to a modest reduction in workforce-related expense, offset in part by an increase in lab operation expense and preclinical and clinical consulting fees.\n\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses were $3.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in G&A expenses was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense and higher patent-related expenses vs. prior period.\n\nNet loss was $13.5 million for the third quarter 2024, compared to $11.7 million for the same period in 2023.\n\n**About CAMP4 Therapeutics**\n\nCAMP4 is developing disease-modifying treatments for a broad range of genetic diseases where amplifying healthy protein may offer therapeutic benefits. Our approach amplifies mRNA by harnessing a fundamental mechanism of how genes are controlled. To amplify mRNA, our therapeutic ASO drug candidates target regRNAs, which act locally on transcription factors and are the master regulators of gene expression. CAMP4’s proprietary RAP Platform™ enables the mapping of regRNAs and generation of therapeutic candidates designed to target the regRNAs associated with genes underlying haploinsufficient and recessive partial loss-of-function disorders, of which there are more than 1,200, in which a modest increase in protein expression may have the potential to be clinically meaningful.
