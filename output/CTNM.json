(NASDAQ: CTNM) (Contineum or the Company), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel, oral small molecule therapies that target biological pathways associated with specific clinical impairments in the treatment of neuroscience, inflammation and immunology (NI&I) indications, today announced authorization of its Investigational New Drug (IND) application from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for PIPE-791 for the treatment of chronic pain associated with two separate indications, osteoarthritis (OA) and low back pain (LBP). PIPE-791 is a novel, brain penetrant, small molecule antagonist of the lysophosphatidic acid 1 receptor (LPA1R). \n\nThe exploratory Phase 1b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, multi-center study is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2025. The Company expects to enroll approximately 40 patients at up to five sites, and a treatment duration of 28 days. Contineum anticipates topline data from the PIPE-791 Phase 1b chronic pain study in early 2026. \n\n“We’re pleased to expand PIPE-791 clinical development to include the potential treatment of chronic pain in a limited, exploratory, signal-seeking study,” said Carmine Stengone, CEO, Contineum Therapeutics. “Researchers have shown that LPA pathways have been specifically implicated in the neuropathic components of preclinical pain models and clinical biomarker studies. This is a first step to evaluate how PIPE-791 may provide a potentially differentiated, non-opioid treatment option for patients with OA and LBP.” \n\nChronic pain is often associated with neuropathic symptoms caused by aberrant signaling in the central nervous system (CNS) leading to heightened sensitivity to painful stimuli. LPA1 activation has been shown to contribute to persistent hypersensitivity, characteristic of neuropathic pain, by promoting the demyelination of nerve fibers, increasing neuronal excitability and enhancing neuroinflammatory responses in the CNS ([Company research](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.contineum-tx.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F08%2FIASP-2024-Contineum-poster-TH721-DSL6-28.pdf&esheet=54153440&newsitemid=20241114778987&lan=en-US&anchor=Company+research&index=1&md5=a7b11b63111f93d901c757da040b9da6), Ueda 2020). By selectively blocking LPA1 receptor activity, an LPA1 antagonist may prevent or reverse the maladaptive changes in the nervous system that initiate and maintain the chronic pain state. \n\nOA is the most common joint disease characterized by chronic pain and decreased mobility. OA affects approximately 33 million people in the United States. Current pharmacological treatments for pain associated with OA consist of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), topical agents, antidepressants and steroid injections. \n\nLBP is a common musculoskeletal condition that can be associated with spinal degeneration, nerve compression and inflammation. Low back pain affects approximately 45 million people in the United States. Over-the-counter or prescription NSAIDs, antidepressants, steroid injections, muscle relaxants and opioids are commonly used for pain and inflammation reduction. \n\nWith the addition of the PIPE-791 Phase 1b chronic pain study, the Company continues to expect its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $213.9 million as of September 30, 2024, are sufficient to fund its planned operations through 2027. \n\n**About Contineum Therapeutics**\n\nContineum Therapeutics (Nasdaq: CTNM) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel, oral small molecule therapies for NI&I indications with high unmet need.
