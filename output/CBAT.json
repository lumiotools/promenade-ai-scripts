(“CBAK” or the “Company”) is a corporation formed in the State of Nevada on\nOctober 4, 1999 as Medina Copy, Inc. The Company changed its name to Medina Coffee, Inc. on October 6, 1999 and subsequently changed its name to China\nBAK Battery, Inc. on February 14, 2005. CBAK and its subsidiaries (hereinafter, collectively referred to as the “Company”) are principally engaged in the\nmanufacture, commercialization and distribution of a wide variety of standard and customized lithium ion (known as “Li-ion” or “Li-ion cell”) high power\nrechargeable batteries. Prior to the disposal of BAK International Limited (“BAK International”) and its subsidiaries (see below), the batteries produced by the\nCompany were for use in cellular telephones, as well as various other portable electronic applications, including high-power handset telephones, laptop\ncomputers, power tools, digital cameras, video camcorders, MP3 players, electric bicycles, hybrid/electric vehicles, and general industrial applications. After the\ndisposal of BAK International and its subsidiaries on June 30, 2014, the Company will focus on the manufacture, commercialization and distribution of high\npower lithium ion rechargeable batteries for use in cordless power tools, light electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, electric cars, electric busses, residential\nenergy supply & uninterruptable power supplies and other high power applications.\nThe shares of the Company traded in the over-the-counter market through the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board from 2005 until May 31, 2006, when the\nCompany obtained approval to list its common stock on The NASDAQ Global Market, and trading commenced that same date under the symbol “CBAK”.\nOn January 10, 2017, the Company filed Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of Nevada to effectuate a merger between the Company and the\nCompany’s newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary, CBAK Merger Sub, Inc. (the “Merger Sub”). According to the Articles of Merger, effective January 16,\n2017, the Merger Sub merged with and into the Company with the Company being the surviving entity (the “Merger”). As permitted by Chapter 92A.180 of\nNevada Revised Statutes, the sole purpose of the Merger was to effect a change of the Company’s name.\nEffective November 30, 2018, the trading symbol for common stock of the Company was changed from CBAK to CBAT. Effective at the opening of business\non June 21, 2019, the Company’s common stock started trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nBasis of Presentation and Organization\nOn November 6, 2004, BAK International, a non-operating holding company that had substantially the same shareholders as Shenzhen BAK Battery Co., Ltd\n(“Shenzhen BAK”), entered into a share swap transaction with the shareholders of Shenzhen BAK for the purpose of the subsequent reverse acquisition of the\nCompany. The share swap transaction between BAK International and the shareholders of Shenzhen BAK was accounted for as a reverse acquisition of\nShenzhen BAK with no adjustment to the historical basis of the assets and liabilities of Shenzhen BAK.\nOn January 20, 2005, the Company completed a share swap transaction with the shareholders of BAK International. The share swap transaction, also referred to\nas the “reverse acquisition” of the Company, was consummated under Nevada law pursuant to the terms of a Securities Exchange Agreement entered by and\namong CBAK, BAK International and the shareholders of BAK International on January 20, 2005. The share swap transaction has been accounted for as a\ncapital-raising transaction of the Company whereby the historical financial statements and operations of Shenzhen BAK are consolidated using historical\ncarrying amounts.\n7\nAlso on January 20, 2005, immediately prior to consummating the share swap transaction, BAK International executed a private placement of its common stock\nwith unrelated investors whereby it issued an aggregate of 1,720,087 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $17,000,000. In conjunction with this\nfinancing, Mr. Xiangqian Li, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company (“Mr. Li”) until March 1, 2016, agreed to place 435,910 shares of the\nCompany’s common stock owned by him into an escrow account pursuant to an Escrow Agreement dated January 20, 2005 (the “Escrow Agreement”).\nPursuant to the Escrow Agreement, 50% of the escrowed shares were to be released to the investors in the private placement if audited net income of the\nCompany for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 was not at least $12,000,000, and the remaining 50% was to be released to investors in the private\nplacement if audited net income of the Company for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 was not at least $27,000,000. If the audited net income of the\nCompany for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2006 reached the above-mentioned targets, the 435,910 shares would be released to Mr. Li in the\namount of 50% upon reaching the 2005 target and the remaining 50% upon reaching the 2006 target.\nUnder accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”), escrow agreements such as the one established by Mr. Li\ngenerally constitute compensation if, following attainment of a performance threshold, shares are returned to a company officer. The Company determined that\nwithout consideration of the compensation charge, the performance thresholds for the year ended September 30, 2005 would be achieved. However, after\nconsideration of a related compensation charge, the Company determined that such thresholds would not have been achieved. The Company also determined\nthat, even without consideration of a compensation charge, the performance thresholds for the year ended September 30, 2006 would not be achieved.\nWhile the 217,955 escrow shares relating to the 2005 performance threshold were previously released to Mr. Li, Mr. Li executed a further undertaking on\nAugust 21, 2006 to return those shares to the escrow agent for the distribution to the relevant investors. However, such shares were not returned to the escrow\nagent, but, pursuant to a Delivery of Make Good Shares, Settlement and Release Agreement between the Company, BAK International and Mr. Li entered into\non October 22, 2007 (the “Li Settlement Agreement”), such shares were ultimately delivered to the Company as described below. Because the Company failed\nto satisfy the performance threshold for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, the remaining 217,955 escrow shares relating to the fiscal year 2006\nperformance threshold were released to the relevant investors. As Mr. Li has not retained any of the shares placed into escrow, and as the investors party to the\nEscrow Agreement are only shareholders of the Company and do not have and are not expected to have any other relationship to the Company, the Company\nhas not recorded a compensation charge for the years ended September 30, 2005 and 2006.\nAt the time the escrow shares relating to the 2006 performance threshold were transferred to the investors in fiscal year 2007, the Company should have\nrecognized a credit to donated shares and a debit to additional paid-in capital, both of which are elements of shareholders’ equity. This entry is not material\nbecause total ordinary shares issued and outstanding, total shareholders’ equity and total assets do not change; nor is there any impact on income or earnings per\nshare. Therefore, previously filed consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 will not be restated. This share transfer has\nbeen reflected in these financial statements by reclassifying the balances of certain items as of October 1, 2007. The balances of donated shares and additional\npaid-in capital as of October 1, 2007 were credited and debited by $7,955,358 respectively, as set out in the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders’\nequity.\nIn November 2007, Mr. Li delivered the 217,955 shares related to the 2005 performance threshold to BAK International pursuant to the Li Settlement\nAgreement; BAK International in turn delivered the shares to the Company. Such shares (other than those issued to investors pursuant to the 2008 Settlement\nAgreements, as described below) are now held by the Company. Upon receipt of these shares, the Company and BAK International released all claims and\ncauses of action against Mr. Li regarding the shares, and Mr. Li released all claims and causes of action against the Company and BAK International regarding\nthe shares. Under the terms of the Li Settlement Agreement, the Company commenced negotiations with the investors who participated in the Company’s\nJanuary 2005 private placement in order to achieve a complete settlement of BAK International’s obligations (and the Company’s obligations to the extent it has\nany) under the applicable agreements with such investors.\n8\nBeginning on March 13, 2008, the Company entered into settlement agreements (the “2008 Settlement Agreements”) with certain investors in the January 2005\nprivate placement. Since the other investors have never submitted any claims regarding this matter, the Company did not reach any settlement with them.\nPursuant to the 2008 Settlement Agreements, the Company and the settling investors have agreed, without any admission of liability, to a settlement and mutual\nrelease from all claims relating to the January 2005 private placement, including all claims relating to the escrow shares related to the 2005 performance\nthreshold that had been placed into escrow by Mr. Li, as well as all claims, including claims for liquidated damages relating to registration rights granted in\nconnection with the January 2005 private placement. Under the 2008 Settlement Agreement, the Company has made settlement payments to each of the settling\ninvestors of the number of shares of the Company’s common stock equivalent to 50% of the number of the escrow shares related to the 2005 performance\nthreshold these investors had claimed; aggregate settlement payments as of June 30, 2015amounted to 73,749 shares. Share payments to date have been made in\nreliance upon the exemptions from registration provided by Section 4(2) and/or other applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In\naccordance with the 2008 Settlement Agreements, the Company filed a registration statement covering the resale of such shares which was declared effective by\nthe SEC on June 26, 2008.\nPursuant to the Li Settlement Agreement, the 2008 Settlement Agreements and upon the release of the 217,955 escrow shares relating to the fiscal year 2006\nperformance threshold to the relevant investors, neither Mr. Li or the Company have any obligations to the investors who participated in the Company’s January\n2005 private placement relating to the escrow shares.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had not received any claim from the other investors who have not been covered by the “2008 Settlement Agreements”\nin the January 2005 private placement.\nAs the Company has transferred the 217,955 shares related to the 2006 performance threshold to the relevant investors in fiscal year 2007 and the Company\nalso have transferred 73,749 shares relating to the 2005 performance threshold to the investors who had entered the “2008 Settlement Agreements” with us in\nfiscal year 2008, pursuant to “Li Settlement Agreement” and “2008 Settlement Agreements”, neither Mr. Li nor the Company had any remaining obligations to\nthose related investors who participated in the Company’s January 2005 private placement relating to the escrow shares.\nOn August 14, 2013, Dalian BAK Trading Co., Ltd was established as a wholly owned subsidiary of China BAK Asia Holding Limited (“BAK Asia”) with a\nregistered capital of $500,000.

The Company plans to raise additional funds through banks borrowings and equity financing in the future to meet its daily cash\ndemands, if required.\nCOVID-19\nThe Company business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or other health epidemics and outbreaks. A wave of\ninfections caused by the Omicron variant emerged in Shanghai in early 2022, and a series of restrictions and quarantines were implemented to contain the\nspread in Shanghai and other regions. The Company’s manufacturing facilities in Dalian, Nanjing and Shaoxing were not producing at full capacity when\nrestrictive measures were in force during 2022, which negatively affected our operational and financial results. China began to modify its zero-COVID policy at\nthe end of 2022, and most of the travel restrictions and quarantine requirements were lifted in December 2022.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that will continue to have on the Company’s business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict and\nquantify, as the actions that the Company, other businesses and governments may take to contain the spread of COVID-19 continue to evolve. Because of the\nsignificant uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the extent of the future business interruption and the related financial impact cannot be\nreasonably estimated at this time.\nThe severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business will continue to depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to,\nthe duration and severity of the pandemic, the new variants of COVID-19, the efficacy and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and the extent and severity of\nthe impact on the global supply chain and the Company’s customers, service providers and suppliers, all of which are uncertain and cannot be reasonably\npredicted at this time. As of the date of issuance of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic\nmay in the future materially impact the Company’s financial condition, liquidity or results of operations is uncertain. The Company is monitoring and assessing\nthe evolving situation closely and evaluating its potential exposure.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company\nhas accumulated deficit from net losses from prior year and significant short-term debt obligations maturing in less than one year as of September 30, 2024.\nThese conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s plan for continuing as a going concern\nincluded improving its profitability, and obtaining additional debt financing, loans from existing directors and shareholders for additional funding to meet its\noperating needs. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in the plans described above or in attracting equity or alternative financing on\nacceptable terms, or if at all. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of\nrecorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenues when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which it\nexpects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company recognizes revenues following the five step model prescribed under ASU No. 2014-09: (i)\nidentify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction\nprice to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation.\n13\nRevenues from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of the Company’s product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon\ndelivery to the customer. The Company expenses incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset\nthat it would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial.\nRevenues from product sales are recorded net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances that are offered within contracts with the\nCompany’s customers.\nProduct revenue reserves, which are classified as a reduction in product revenues, are generally characterized in the categories: discounts and returns. These\nreserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable as the amount\nis payable to the Company’s customer.\nContract liability\nThe Company’s contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue associated with batteries development and deposits received from customers allocated to the\nperformance obligations that are unsatisfied.

Goodwill is attributed to the premium that the Company paid to obtain the value of the business of Hitrans and the synergies expected from the\ncombined operations of Hitrans and the Company, the assembled workforce and their knowledge and experience in provision of raw materials used in\nmanufacturing of lithium batteries. The total amount of the goodwill acquired is not deductible for tax purposes.\nThe Company performed Goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests when an event occurs or\ncircumstances change indicating the asset might be impaired. Goodwill was fully impaired as of December 31, 2022.\n13. Goodwill\nBalance as of January 1, 2023 $ -\nImpairment of goodwill -\nForeign exchange adjustment -\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024 $ -\nThe Company performed goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests when an event occurs or\ncircumstances change indicating the asset might be impaired. As of December 31, 2022, the Company performed testing on reporting unit of NCM precursor\nand cathode materials products (“Hitrans Reporting unit”)\nThe Company first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying\namount. For those reporting units where it is determined that it is more likely than not that their fair values are less than the units’ carrying amounts, the\nCompany will perform the first step of a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. After performing the assessment, if the carrying amounts of the\nreporting units are higher than their fair values, the Company will perform the second step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.\nThe Company performed qualitative assessments for Hitrans reporting unit. Based on the requirements of ASC 350-20-35-3C through ASC 350-20-35-3G, the\nCompany evaluated all relevant factors, weighed all factors in their totality. For the year ended December 31, 2022, as the financial performance of Hitrans\nreporting unit was below original expectations, fair value of this reporting unit was indicated to be lower than its carrying value. For this reporting unit, where it\nwas determined that it was more likely than not that its fair value was less than the units’ carrying amount after performing the qualitative assessment, as a\nresult, the Company performed the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test for these two reporting units.\nFor the two-step goodwill impairment test, the Company estimated the fair value with either income approach or asset approach for specific reporting unit\ncomponents. With the income approach, the Company estimates the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows\nare based on the best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected expansion, pricing, market share, and general economic\nconditions. Certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models. Changes in these\nforecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. Asset based approach is used in evaluating the fair value of some specific\ncomponents which is deemed as the most prudent approach due to the unpredictability of future cash flows.\n26\nThe result of step one impairment test for the Hitrans reporting unit failed, with its determined fair value lower than the book value. The Company performed\nstep two impairment test, applying the income approach, resulting an impairment loss of goodwill of $1,556,078 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The\nimpairment loss of goodwill was primarily attributable to the impairment related to Hitrans reporting unit as the financial performance of the reporting unit of\nHitrans continued to fall below the Company’s original expectations.\n14.

Management believes it is more likely than not that the\nCompany will not realize these potential tax benefits as these operations will not generate any operating profits in the foreseeable future. As a result, a valuation\nallowance was provided against the full amount of the potential tax benefits.\nAccording to the PRC Tax Administration and Collection Law, the statute of limitations is three years if the underpayment of taxes is due to computational\nerrors made by the taxpayer or its withholding agent. The statute of limitations extends to five years under special circumstances, which are not clearly defined.\nIn the case of a related party transaction, the statute of limitations is ten years. There is no statute of limitations in the case of tax evasion.\nThe impact of an uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained\nupon audit by the relevant tax authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Interest\nand penalties on income taxes will be classified as a component of the provisions for income taxes.\n22. Statutory reserves\nAs stipulated by the relevant laws and regulations in the PRC, company established in the PRC (the “PRC subsidiary”) is required to maintain a statutory\nreserve made out of profit for the year based on the PRC subsidiary’ statutory financial statements which are prepared in accordance with the accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the PRC. The amount and allocation basis are decided by the director of the PRC subsidiary annually and is not to be less than\n10% of the profit for the year of the PRC subsidiary. The aggregate amount allocated to the reserves will be limited to 50% of registered capital for certain\nsubsidiaries. Statutory reserve can be used for expanding the capital base of the PRC subsidiary by means of capitalization issue.\nIn addition, as a result of the relevant PRC laws and regulations which impose restriction on distribution or transfer of assets out of the PRC statutory reserve,\n$1,230,511 representing the PRC statutory reserve of the subsidiary as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, are also considered under restriction for\ndistribution.\n23. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the\nmeasurement date. This topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when measuring\nfair value. Certain current assets and current liabilities are financial instruments. Management believes their carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair\nvalue because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and, if applicable, their current interest rates\nare equivalent to interest rates currently available. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:\n● Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n● Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for\nthe assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.\n● Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\n39\nValuation of debt products depends upon a number of factors, including prevailing interest rates for like securities, expected volatility in future interest rates,\nand other relevant terms of the debt. Other factors that may be considered include the borrower’s ability to adequately service its debt, the fair market value of\nthe borrower in relation to the face amount of its outstanding debt and the quality of collateral securing the Company’s debt investments. The fair value of these\ndebt products classified as Level 2 is established by reference to the prices quoted by respective fund administrators.\nThe fair value of warrants was determined using the Binomial Model, with level 3 inputs (Note 27).\nThe fair value of share options was determined using the Binomial Model, with level 3 inputs (Note 25).\nThe carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, pledged deposits, trade accounts and bills receivable, other\nreceivables, balances with former subsidiaries, notes payable, other short-term loans, short-term and long-term bank loans and other payables approximate their\nfair values because of the short maturity of these instruments or the rate of interest of these instruments approximate the market rate of interest.\n24. Employee Benefit Plan\nFull time employees of the Company in the PRC participate in a government mandated defined contribution plan, pursuant to which certain pension benefits,\nmedical care, employee housing fund and other welfare benefits are provided to the employees.

Warrants are remeasured\nat fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings in each reporting period.\nOn February 8, 2021, the Company entered into another securities purchase agreement with the same investors, pursuant to which the Company issued in a\nregistered direct offering, an aggregate of 8,939,976 shares of common stock of the Company at a per share purchase price of $7.83. In addition, the Company\nissued to the investors (i) in a concurrent private placement, the Series A-1 warrants to purchase a total of 4,469,988 shares of common stock, at a per share\nexercise price of $7.67 and exercisable for 42 months from the date of issuance; (ii) in the registered direct offering, the Series B warrants to purchase a total of\n4,469,988 shares of common stock, at a per share exercise price of $7.83 and exercisable for 90 days from the date of issuance; and (iii) in the registered direct\noffering, the Series A-2 warrants to purchase up to 2,234,992 shares of common stock, at a per share exercise price of $7.67 and exercisable for 45 months from\nthe date of issuance. The Company received gross proceeds of approximately $70 million from the registered direct offering and the concurrent private\nplacement, before deducting fees to the placement agent and other estimated offering expenses of $5.0 million payable by the Company. In addition, the\nplacement agent for this transaction also received warrants (“Placement Agent Warrants”) for the purchase of up to 446,999 shares of the Company’s common\nstock at an exercise price of $9.204 per share exercisable for 36 months after 6 months from the issuance.\nOn May 10, 2021, the Company entered into that Amendment No. 1 to the Series B Warrant (the “Series B Warrant Amendment”) with each of the holders of\nthe Company’s outstanding Series B warrants. Pursuant to the Series B Warrant Amendment, the term of the Series B warrants was extended from May 11,\n2021 to August 31, 2021.\nAs of the date of this report, Series B warrant, along with Series A-2 warrants, had both expired.\nAll of the above warrants were expired as of September 30, 2024.\n44\nThe fair value of the outstanding warrants was calculated using Binomial Model based on backward induction with the following assumptions:\nWarrants issued in the 2020 Financing\nInvestor Placement\nWarrants Agent Warrants\nDecember 31, December 31,\nAppraisal Date 2023 2023\nMarket price per share (USD/share) $ n/a $ 1.05\nExercise price (USD/price) n/a 6.475\nRisk free rate n/a 5.3%\nDividend yield n/a 0.0%\nExpected term/ Contractual life (years) n/a 0.4 years\nExpected volatility n/a 53.9%\nWarrants issued in the 2021 Financing\nWarrants holder\nInvestor Placement\nWarrants Agent\nSeries A1 Warrants\nDecember 31, December 31,\nAppraisal Date 2023 2023\nMarket price per share (USD/share) 1.05 1.05\nExercise price (USD/price) 7.67 9.204\nRisk free rate 5.1% 5.1%\nDividend yield 0.0% 0.0%\nExpected term/ Contractual life (years) 0.6 year 0.6 year\nExpected volatility 63.0% 60.3%\nThe following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of warrants liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs:\nDecember 31, September 30,\n2023 2024\nBalance at the beginning of the year/ period $ 136,000 $ -\nWarrants issued to institution investors - -\nWarrants issued to placement agent - -\nWarrants redeemed - -\nFair value change of the issued warrants included in earnings (136,000) -\nBalance at end of year/ period - -\nThe following is a summary of the warrant activity:\nWeighted\nAverage\nAverage Remaining\nNumber of Exercise Contractual\nWarrants Price Term in Years\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024 5,296,579 $ 7.71 0.60\nExercisable at January 1, 2024 5,296,579 $ 7.71 0.60\nGranted - - -\nExercised / surrendered - - -\nExpired (5,296,579) 7.71 -\nOutstanding at September 30, 2024 - - -\nExercisable at September 30, 2024 - - -\n45\n28.

Segment Information\nThe Group’s chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) who reviews financial information of operating\nsegments based on US GAAP amounts when making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance of the Company.\nAs a result of the Hitrans acquisition discussed in Note 12, the Group determined that Hitrans met the criteria for separate reportable segment given its financial\ninformation is separately reviewed by the Group’s CEO. As a result, the Group determined that it operated in two operating segments namely CBAK and\nHitrans upon completion of acquisition. CBAK’s segment mainly includes the manufacture, commercialization and distribution of a wide variety of standard\nand customized lithium ion rechargeable batteries for use in a wide array of applications. Hitrans’ segment mainly includes the development and manufacturing\nof NCM precursor and cathode materials.\nThe Company primarily operates in the PRC and substantially all of the Company’s long-lived assets are located in the PRC.\nThe Company’s chief operating decision maker evaluates performance based on each reporting segment’s net revenue, cost of revenues, operating expenses,\noperating income, finance income (expense), other income and net income. Net revenue, cost of revenues, operating expenses, operating income, finance\nincome (expense), other income and net income by segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 were as follows:\nCorporate\nunallocated\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023 CBAT Hitrans (note) Consolidated\nNet revenues $ 44,327,653 $ 19,113,456 $ - $ 63,441,109\nCost of revenues (32,629,427) (18,563,104) - (51,192,531)\nGross profit 11,698,226 550,352 - 12,248,578\nTotal operating expenses (4,120,379) (2,577,715) (261,390) (6,959,484)\nOperating income (loss) 7,577,847 (2,027,363) (261,390) 5,289,094\nFinance (expenses) income, net (403,599) (43,435) 3 (447,031)\nOther income, net 596,463 5,191 15,000 616,654\nIncome tax credit - 305,431 - 305,431\nNet income (loss) 7,770,711 (1,760,176) (246,387) 5,764,148\nCorporate\nunallocated\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 CBAT Hitrans (note) Consolidated\nNet revenues $ 33,461,793 $ 11,166,448 $ - $ 44,628,241\nCost of revenues (25,796,784) (11,876,900) - (37,673,684)\nGross profit (loss) 7,665,009 (710,452) - 6,954,557\nTotal operating expenses (5,778,378) (1,887,142) (116,910) (7,782,430)\nOperating income (loss) 1,886,631 (2,597,594) (116,910) (827,873)\nFinance income (expense), net 28,366 (68,718) 2 (40,350)\nOther (expenses) income, net 459,628 62,343 - 521,971\nIncome tax expenses (339,287) - - (339,287)\nNet income (loss) 2,035,338 (2,603,969) (116,908) (685,539)\nCorporate\nunallocated\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023 CBAT Hitrans (note) Consolidated\nNet revenues $ 96,163,040 $ 52,095,640 $ - $ 148,258,680\nCost of revenues (77,826,308) (51,393,408) - (129,219,716)\nGross profit 18,336,732 702,232 - 19,038,964\nTotal operating expenses (12,190,713) (7,363,599) (849,498) (20,403,810)\nOperating income (loss) 6,146,019 (6,661,367) (849,498) (1,364,846)\nFinance (expenses) income, net (216,939) 27,850 (159) (189,248)\nOther income, net 817,803 205,104 136,000 1,158,907\nIncome tax credit - 1,015,626 - 1,015,626\nNet income (loss) 6,746,883 (5,412,787) (713,657) 620,439\n48\nCorporate\nunallocated\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 CBAT Hitrans (note) Consolidated\nNet revenues $ 113,897,786 $ 37,345,932 $ - $ 151,243,718\nCost of revenues (74,856,962) (37,923,126) - (112,780,088)\nGross profit (loss) 39,040,824 (577,194) - 38,463,630\nTotal operating expenses (16,541,643) (5,001,025) (1,538,372) (23,081,040)\nOperating income (loss) 22,499,181 (5,578,219) (1,538,372) 15,382,590\nFinance income (expenses), net 659,542 (1,397) (111) 658,034\nOther income, net 640,485 417,811 - 1,058,296\nIncome tax expenses (2,188,800) - - (2,188,800)\nNet income (loss) 21,610,408 (5,161,805) (1,538,483) 14,910,120\nAs of September 30, 2024\nIdentifiable long-lived assets 100,014,711 44,165,797 - 144,180,508\nTotal assets 212,814,150 80,620,657 42,547 293,477,354\nNote: The Company does not allocate its assets located and expenses incurred outside China to its reportable segments because these assets and activities are\nmanaged at a corporate level.\nNet revenues by product:\nThe Company’s products can be categorized into high power lithium batteries and materials used in manufacturing of lithium batteries.

Our primary product offerings consist\nof new energy high power lithium batteries and sodium batteries. In addition, after completing the acquisition of 81.56% of registered equity interests\n(representing 75.57% of paid-up capital) of Hitrans in November 2021, we entered the business of developing and manufacturing NCM precursor and cathode\nmaterials. Hitrans is a leading developer and manufacturer of ternary precursor and cathode materials in China, whose products have a wide range of\napplications including electric vehicles, electric tools, high-end digital products and storage, among others.\nWe acquired our operating assets, including customers, employees, patents and technologies from our former subsidiary BAK International (Tianjin) Ltd. We\nacquired these assets in exchange for a reduction in accounts receivable from our former subsidiaries that were disposed of in June 2014.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we report financial and operational information in two segments: (i) production of high-power lithium and sodium battery cells and\n(ii) manufacture and sales of materials used in high power lithium battery cells.\nWe currently conduct our business primarily through (i) CBAK Power, (ii) Nanjing CBAK, (iii) CBAK Shangqiu, (iv) Nanjing BFD, and (v) Hitrans.\nAs disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed on March 15, 2024 and other reports filed with the SEC, we\nstarted construction of our Nanjing facilities to expand our lithium battery manufacturing capabilities in 2020. The project comprises two phases. Phase I,\nencompassing an area of approximately 27,173 square meters, was put into operation in the second half of 2021. Since then, we have been steadily increasing\nPhase I’s production capacity, which currently stands at 2 GWh. Construction of the Phase II began in 2022 and includes three major manufacturing plants. The\nconstruction of the ceiling stage for the first of these three plants in Phase II was completed in 2023, and we anticipate it will commence operations in 2025.\nOnce fully operational, the Nanjing facilities are projected to provide a total capacity of 20 GWh to support our customers’ growing demand. In 2023, our client\ndemand for batteries soared, prompting us to rent additional manufacturing space in Shangqiu, Henan, PRC. Our Shangqiu facility has a capacity of 0.5 GWh\nper year. We have two production lines at this leased facility, and the renovation costs were covered by the owner. We have been expanding our business by\ndeveloping new products, fostering new partnerships and strategic acquisition of companies that complement and augment our business.\n51\nThe clean energy industry is of strategic importance in China and many other countries. With the global emphasis on the new energy industry, we anticipate\nsecuring more potential orders from our clients.

We may also require additional cash due to changing business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or\nacquisitions we may decide to pursue. We plan to renew these loans upon maturity, if required, and plan to raise additional funds through bank borrowings and\nequity financing in the future to meet our daily cash demands, if required. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining this\nfinancing. If our existing cash and bank borrowing are insufficient to meet our requirements, we may seek to sell equity securities, debt securities or borrow\nfrom lending institutions. We can make no assurance that financing will be available in the amounts we need or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The sale of\nequity securities, including convertible debt securities, would dilute the interests of our current shareholders. The incurrence of debt would divert cash for\nworking capital and capital expenditures to service debt obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that restrict our operations and our\nability to pay dividends to our shareholders.

We continually evaluate these estimates based on our own historical\nexperience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions, our expectations regarding the future based on available information and\nreasonable assumptions, which together form our basis for making judgments about matters that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of\nestimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, our actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies\nrequire a higher degree of judgment than others in their application.\nThere were no material changes to the critical accounting policies previously disclosed in our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 15, 2024.\nChanges in Accounting Standards\nPlease refer to Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, “Principal Activities, Basis of Presentation and Organization—Recently Adopted\nAccounting Standards” and “—Recently Issued But Not Yet Adopted Accounting Pronouncements” for a discussion of relevant pronouncements.\n63\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nNot applicable.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management has carried out an evaluation, with the participation and under the supervision of our\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September\n30, 2024. Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports\nwe file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC\nand that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as\nappropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management\nrecognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control\nobjectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures.\nManagement conducted its evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial\nOfficer. Based upon, and as of the date of this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and\nprocedures were ineffective as of September 30, 2024.\nAs we disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024, during our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2023, management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting:\n● We did not have appropriate policies and procedures in place to evaluate the proper accounting and disclosures of key documents and agreements.\n● We do not have sufficient and skilled accounting personnel with an appropriate level of technical accounting knowledge and experience in the\napplication of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States commensurate with our financial reporting requirements.\nIn order to cure the foregoing material weaknesses, we have taken or are taking the following remediation measures:\n● We are in the process of hiring a permanent chief financial officer with significant U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience. Ms. Xiangyu Pei was\nappointed by the Board of Directors of the Company as the Interim Chief Financial Officer on August 23, 2019. Ms. Xiangyu Pei resigned as our\nInterim Chief Financial Officer on August 22, 2023 but has continued to serve in the Company’s finance department and on the board of director. Mr.\nJiewei Li was appointed as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer on August 22, 2023.\n● We have regularly offered our financial personnel trainings on internal control and risk management. We have regularly provided trainings to our\nfinancial personnel on U.S. GAAP accounting guidelines. We plan to continue to provide trainings to our financial team and our other relevant\npersonnel on the U.S. GAAP accounting guidelines applicable to our financial reporting requirements.\nWe intend to complete the remediation of the material weaknesses discussed above as soon as practicable but we can give no assurance that we will be able to\ndo so. Designing and implementing an effective disclosure controls and procedures is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in\nour business and the economic and regulatory environments and to devote significant resources to maintain a financial reporting system that adequately satisfies\nour reporting obligations. The remedial measures that we have taken and intend to take may not fully address the material weakness that we have identified.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nExcept for the matters described above, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that\nhave materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n64\nPART II\nOTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1.

Principal Activities, Basis of Presentation and Organization\nPrincipal Activities\nCBAK Energy Technology, Inc. (formerly known as China BAK Battery, Inc.) (“CBAK” or the “Company”) is a corporation formed in the State of Nevada\non October 4, 1999 as Medina Copy, Inc. The Company changed its name to Medina Coffee, Inc. on October 6, 1999 and subsequently changed its name to\nChina BAK Battery, Inc. on February 14, 2005. CBAK and its subsidiaries (hereinafter, collectively referred to as the “Company”) are principally engaged\nin the manufacture, commercialization and distribution of a wide variety of standard and customized lithium ion (known as “Li-ion” or “Li-ion cell”) high\npower rechargeable batteries. Prior to the disposal of BAK International Limited (“BAK International”) and its subsidiaries (see below), the batteries\nproduced by the Company were for use in cellular telephones, as well as various other portable electronic applications, including high-power handset\ntelephones, laptop computers, power tools, digital cameras, video camcorders, MP3 players, electric bicycles, hybrid/electric vehicles, and general\nindustrial applications. After the disposal of BAK International and its subsidiaries on June 30, 2014, the Company will focus on the manufacture,\ncommercialization and distribution of high power lithium ion rechargeable batteries for use in cordless power tools, light electric vehicles, hybrid electric\nvehicles, electric cars, electric busses, residential energy supply & uninterruptable power supplies and other high power applications.\nThe shares of the Company traded in the over-the-counter market through the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board from 2005 until May 31, 2006, when the\nCompany obtained approval to list its common stock on The NASDAQ Global Market, and trading commenced that same date under the symbol “CBAK”.\nOn January 10, 2017, the Company filed Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of Nevada to effectuate a merger between the Company and the\nCompany’s newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary, CBAK Merger Sub, Inc. (the “Merger Sub”). According to the Articles of Merger, effective January\n16, 2017, the Merger Sub merged with and into the Company with the Company being the surviving entity (the “Merger”). As permitted by Chapter\n92A.180 of Nevada Revised Statutes, the sole purpose of the Merger was to effect a change of the Company’s name.\nEffective November 30, 2018, the trading symbol for common stock of the Company was changed from CBAK to CBAT. Effective at the opening of\nbusiness on June 21, 2019, the Company’s common stock started trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nBasis of Presentation and Organization\nOn November 6, 2004, BAK International, a non-operating holding company that had substantially the same shareholders as Shenzhen BAK Battery Co.,\nLtd (“Shenzhen BAK”), entered into a share swap transaction with the shareholders of Shenzhen BAK for the purpose of the subsequent reverse acquisition\nof the Company. The share swap transaction between BAK International and the shareholders of Shenzhen BAK was accounted for as a reverse acquisition\nof Shenzhen BAK with no adjustment to the historical basis of the assets and liabilities of Shenzhen BAK.\nOn January 20, 2005, the Company completed a share swap transaction with the shareholders of BAK International. The share swap transaction, also\nreferred to as the “reverse acquisition” of the Company, was consummated under Nevada law pursuant to the terms of a Securities Exchange Agreement\nentered by and among CBAK, BAK International and the shareholders of BAK International on January 20, 2005. The share swap transaction has been\naccounted for as a capital-raising transaction of the Company whereby the historical financial statements and operations of Shenzhen BAK are consolidated\nusing historical carrying amounts.\n7\nAlso on January 20, 2005, immediately prior to consummating the share swap transaction, BAK International executed a private placement of its common\nstock with unrelated investors whereby it issued an aggregate of 1,720,087 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $17,000,000. In conjunction with\nthis financing, Mr. Xiangqian Li, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company (“Mr. Li”) until March 1, 2016, agreed to place 435,910\nshares of the Company’s common stock owned by him into an escrow account pursuant to an Escrow Agreement dated January 20, 2005 (the “Escrow\nAgreement”). Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, 50% of the escrowed shares were to be released to the investors in the private placement if audited net\nincome of the Company for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 was not at least $12,000,000, and the remaining 50% was to be released to investors\nin the private placement if audited net income of the Company for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 was not at least $27,000,000. If the audited net\nincome of the Company for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2006 reached the above-mentioned targets, the 435,910 shares would be\nreleased to Mr. Li in the amount of 50% upon reaching the 2005 target and the remaining 50% upon reaching the 2006 target.\nUnder accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”), escrow agreements such as the one established by Mr. Li\ngenerally constitute compensation if, following attainment of a performance threshold, shares are returned to a company officer. The Company determined\nthat without consideration of the compensation charge, the performance thresholds for the year ended September 30, 2005 would be achieved. However,\nafter consideration of a related compensation charge, the Company determined that such thresholds would not have been achieved. The Company also\ndetermined that, even without consideration of a compensation charge, the performance thresholds for the year ended September 30, 2006 would not be\nachieved.\nWhile the 217,955 escrow shares relating to the 2005 performance threshold were previously released to Mr. Li, Mr. Li executed a further undertaking on\nAugust 21, 2006 to return those shares to the escrow agent for the distribution to the relevant investors. However, such shares were not returned to the\nescrow agent, but, pursuant to a Delivery of Make Good Shares, Settlement and Release Agreement between the Company, BAK International and Mr. Li\nentered into on October 22, 2007 (the “Li Settlement Agreement”), such shares were ultimately delivered to the Company as described below. Because the\nCompany failed to satisfy the performance threshold for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, the remaining 217,955 escrow shares relating to the\nfiscal year 2006 performance threshold were released to the relevant investors. As Mr. Li has not retained any of the shares placed into escrow, and as the\ninvestors party to the Escrow Agreement are only shareholders of the Company and do not have and are not expected to have any other relationship to the\nCompany, the Company has not recorded a compensation charge for the years ended September 30, 2005 and 2006.\nAt the time the escrow shares relating to the 2006 performance threshold were transferred to the investors in fiscal year 2007, the Company should have\nrecognized a credit to donated shares and a debit to additional paid-in capital, both of which are elements of shareholders’ equity. This entry is not material\nbecause total ordinary shares issued and outstanding, total shareholders’ equity and total assets do not change; nor is there any impact on income or\nearnings per share. Therefore, previously filed consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 will not be restated. This\nshare transfer has been reflected in these financial statements by reclassifying the balances of certain items as of October 1, 2007. The balances of donated\nshares and additional paid-in capital as of October 1, 2007 were credited and debited by $7,955,358 respectively, as set out in the consolidated statements\nof changes in shareholders’ equity.\nIn November 2007, Mr. Li delivered the 217,955 shares related to the 2005 performance threshold to BAK International pursuant to the Li Settlement\nAgreement; BAK International in turn delivered the shares to the Company. Such shares (other than those issued to investors pursuant to the 2008\nSettlement Agreements, as described below) are now held by the Company. Upon receipt of these shares, the Company and BAK International released all\nclaims and causes of action against Mr. Li regarding the shares, and Mr. Li released all claims and causes of action against the Company and BAK\nInternational regarding the shares. Under the terms of the Li Settlement Agreement, the Company commenced negotiations with the investors who\nparticipated in the Company’s January 2005 private placement in order to achieve a complete settlement of BAK International’s obligations (and the\nCompany’s obligations to the extent it has any) under the applicable agreements with such investors.\nBeginning on March 13, 2008, the Company entered into settlement agreements (the “2008 Settlement Agreements”) with certain investors in the January\n2005 private placement. Since the other investors have never submitted any claims regarding this matter, the Company did not reach any settlement with\nthem.\n8\nPursuant to the 2008 Settlement Agreements, the Company and the settling investors have agreed, without any admission of liability, to a settlement and\nmutual release from all claims relating to the January 2005 private placement, including all claims relating to the escrow shares related to the 2005\nperformance threshold that had been placed into escrow by Mr. Li, as well as all claims, including claims for liquidated damages relating to registration\nrights granted in connection with the January 2005 private placement. Under the 2008 Settlement Agreement, the Company has made settlement payments\nto each of the settling investors of the number of shares of the Company’s common stock equivalent to 50% of the number of the escrow shares related to\nthe 2005 performance threshold these investors had claimed; aggregate settlement payments as of June 30, 2015amounted to 73,749 shares. Share\npayments to date have been made in reliance upon the exemptions from registration provided by Section 4(2) and/or other applicable provisions of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended. In accordance with the 2008 Settlement Agreements, the Company filed a registration statement covering the resale of\nsuch shares which was declared effective by the SEC on June 26, 2008.\nPursuant to the Li Settlement Agreement, the 2008 Settlement Agreements and upon the release of the 217,955 escrow shares relating to the fiscal year\n2006 performance threshold to the relevant investors, neither Mr. Li or the Company have any obligations to the investors who participated in the\nCompany’s January 2005 private placement relating to the escrow shares.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had not received any claim from the other investors who have not been covered by the “2008 Settlement Agreements”\nin the January 2005 private placement.\nAs the Company has transferred the 217,955 shares related to the 2006 performance threshold to the relevant investors in fiscal year 2007 and the Company\nalso have transferred 73,749 shares relating to the 2005 performance threshold to the investors who had entered the “2008 Settlement Agreements” with us\nin fiscal year 2008, pursuant to “Li Settlement Agreement” and “2008 Settlement Agreements”, neither Mr. Li nor the Company had any remaining\nobligations to those related investors who participated in the Company’s January 2005 private placement relating to the escrow shares.\nOn August 14, 2013, Dalian BAK Trading Co., Ltd was established as a wholly owned subsidiary of China BAK Asia Holding Limited (“BAK Asia”) with\na registered capital of $500,000.

Actual results could differ from those estimates. This basis of accounting differs in certain material\nrespects from that used for the preparation of the books of account of the Company and its subsidiaries, which are prepared in accordance with the\naccounting principles and the relevant financial regulations applicable to enterprises with limited liability established in the PRC or Hong Kong. The\naccompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect necessary adjustments not recorded in the books of account of the Company’s\nsubsidiaries to present them in conformity with US GAAP.\nOn December 8, 2020, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional investors, pursuant to which the Company\nissued in a registered direct offering, an aggregate of 9,489,800 shares of common stock of the Company at a per share purchase price of $5.18, and\nwarrants to purchase an aggregate of 3,795,920 shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $6.46 per share exercisable for 36 months\nfrom the date of issuance, for gross proceeds of approximately $49.16 million, before deducting fees to the placement agent and other estimated offering\nexpenses of $3.81 million payable by the Company.

As of date of this report, the above warrants were expired.\nOn February 8, 2021, the Company entered into another securities purchase agreement with the same investors, pursuant to which the Company issued in a\nregistered direct offering, an aggregate of 8,939,976 shares of common stock of the Company at a per share purchase price of $7.83. In addition, the\nCompany issued to the investors (i) in a concurrent private placement, the Series A-1 warrants to purchase a total of 4,469,988 shares of common stock, at\na per share exercise price of $7.67 and exercisable for 42 months from the date of issuance; (ii) in the registered direct offering, the Series B warrants to\npurchase a total of 4,469,988 shares of common stock, at a per share exercise price of $7.83 and exercisable for 90 days from the date of issuance; and (iii)\nin the registered direct offering, the Series A-2 warrants to purchase up to 2,234,992 shares of common stock, at a per share exercise price of $7.67 and\nexercisable for 45 months from the date of issuance.

Pursuant to the Series B Warrant Amendment, the term of the Series B warrants was extended from May\n11, 2021 to August 31, 2021.\nAs of August 31, 2021, the Company had not received any notices from the investors to exercise Series B warrants. As of the date of this report, Series B\nwarrants, along with Series A-2 warrants, had both expired.\n12\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had $35.1 million bank loans and approximately $109.6 million of other current liabilities.\nThe Company is currently expanding its product lines and manufacturing capacity in its Dalian, Nanjing and Zhejiang plant which requires more funding to\nfinance the expansion. The Company plans to raise additional funds through banks borrowings and equity financing in the future to meet its daily cash\ndemands, if required.\nCOVID-19\nThe Company business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or other health epidemics and outbreaks. A wave\nof infections caused by the Omicron variant emerged in Shanghai in early 2022, and a series of restrictions and quarantines were implemented to contain\nthe spread in Shanghai and other regions. The Company’s manufacturing facilities in Dalian, Nanjing and Shaoxing were not producing at full capacity\nwhen restrictive measures were in force during 2022, which negatively affected our operational and financial results. China began to modify its zero-\nCOVID policy at the end of 2022, and most of the travel restrictions and quarantine requirements were lifted in December 2022.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that will continue to have on the Company’s business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict and\nquantify, as the actions that the Company, other businesses and governments may take to contain the spread of COVID-19 continue to evolve. Because of\nthe significant uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the extent of the future business interruption and the related financial impact cannot be\nreasonably estimated at this time.\nThe severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business will continue to depend on a number of factors, including, but not\nlimited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic, the new variants of COVID-19, the efficacy and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and the extent\nand severity of the impact on the global supply chain and the Company’s customers, service providers and suppliers, all of which are uncertain and cannot\nbe reasonably predicted at this time. As of the date of issuance of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements, the extent to which the\nCOVID-19 pandemic may in the future materially impact the Company’s financial condition, liquidity or results of operations is uncertain. The Company is\nmonitoring and assessing the evolving situation closely and evaluating its potential exposure.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The\nCompany has accumulated deficit from net losses from prior year and significant short-term debt obligations maturing in less than one year as of June 30,\n2024. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s plan for continuing as a going\nconcern included improving its profitability, and obtaining additional debt financing, loans from existing directors and shareholders for additional funding\nto meet its operating needs. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in the plans described above or in attracting equity or\nalternative financing on acceptable terms, or if at all. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the\nrecoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to\ncontinue as a going concern.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenues when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which it\nexpects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company recognizes revenues following the five step model prescribed under ASU No. 2014-09: (i)\nidentify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the\ntransaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation.\n13\nRevenues from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of the Company’s product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon\ndelivery to the customer. The Company expenses incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the\nasset that it would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial.\nRevenues from product sales are recorded net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances that are offered within contracts with the\nCompany’s customers.\nProduct revenue reserves, which are classified as a reduction in product revenues, are generally characterized in the categories: discounts and returns. These\nreserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable as the\namount is payable to the Company’s customer.\nContract liability\nThe Company’s contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue associated with batteries development and deposits received from customers allocated to the\nperformance obligations that are unsatisfied. Changes in contract liability balances were not materially impacted by business acquisition, change in\nestimate of transaction price or any other factors during any of the years presented. The table below presents the activity of the deferred batteries\ndevelopment and sales of batteries revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024 respectively:\nJune 30\n2023 2024\nBalance at beginning of the year $ 1,869,525 $ 784,000\nDevelopment fees collected/ deposits received - -\nDevelopment and sales of batteries revenue recognized - -\nForeign exchange adjustment (51,570) -\nBalance at end of period $ 1,817,955 $ 784,000\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from\nContracts with Customers, which requires the recognition and measurement of contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in\naccordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This creates an exception to the general recognition and measurement principles in\nASC 805. As a smaller reporting company, ASU 2021-08 will be effective for the Company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this ASU should be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or\nafter the effective date of the amendments.

ASU 2023-01 requires\nentities to amortize leasehold improvements associated with common control lease over the useful life to the common control group (regardless of the lease\nterm) as long as the lessee controls the use of the underlying asset through a lease, and to account for any remaining leasehold improvements as a transfer\nbetween entities under common control through an adjustment to equity when the lessee no longer controls the underlying asset. This ASU will be effective\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and\nannual financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. An entity may apply ASU 2023-01 either prospectively or retrospectively.\nThe adoption did not have material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement.\n14\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-02, Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax\nCredit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method, that is intended to improve the accounting and disclosures for investments in tax credit\nstructures. This ASU allows reporting entities to elect to account for qualifying tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method,\nregardless of the program giving rise to the related income tax credits. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for all entities in any interim period. The adoption\ndid not have material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement.\nRecently Issued But Not Yet Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-06 to clarify or improve disclosure and presentation requirements of a variety of\ntopics, which will allow users to more easily compare entities subject to the SEC’s existing disclosures with those entities that were not previously subject\nto the requirements, and align the requirements in the FASB accounting standard codification with the SEC’s regulations. The Company is currently\nevaluating the provisions of the amendments and the impact on its condensed consolidated financial statement presentations and disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280). This ASU updates reportable\nsegment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating\nDecision Maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of a segment’s profit or loss. This ASU also requires disclosure of the title and\nposition of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment’s profit or loss in\nassessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and\ninterim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Adoption of the ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods\npresented in the financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted. This ASU will likely result in us including the additional required disclosures when\nadopted. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of the amendments and the impact on its condensed consolidated financial statement\npresentations and disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated\ninformation about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective on a\nprospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet\nbeen issued or made available for issuance. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of the amendments and the impact on its condensed\nconsolidated financial statement presentations and disclosures.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date\nare not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\n2.

Goodwill is attributed to the premium that the Company paid to obtain the value of the business of Hitrans and the synergies\nexpected from the combined operations of Hitrans and the Company, the assembled workforce and their knowledge and experience in provision of raw\nmaterials used in manufacturing of lithium batteries. The total amount of the goodwill acquired is not deductible for tax purposes.\nThe Company performed Goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests when an event occurs or\ncircumstances change indicating the asset might be impaired.

Goodwill\nBalance as of January 1, 2023 $ -\nImpairment of goodwill -\nForeign exchange adjustment -\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024 $ -\nThe Company performed goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests when an event occurs or\ncircumstances change indicating the asset might be impaired. As of December 31, 2022, the Company performed testing on reporting unit of NCM\nprecursor and cathode materials products (“Hitrans Reporting unit”)\nThe Company first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying\namount. For those reporting units where it is determined that it is more likely than not that their fair values are less than the units’ carrying amounts, the\nCompany will perform the first step of a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. After performing the assessment, if the carrying amounts of the\nreporting units are higher than their fair values, the Company will perform the second step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.\nThe Company performed qualitative assessments for Hitrans reporting unit. Based on the requirements of ASC 350-20-35-3C through ASC 350-20-35-3G,\nthe Company evaluated all relevant factors, weighed all factors in their totality. For the year ended December 31, 2022, as the financial performance of\nHitrans reporting unit was below original expectations, fair value of this reporting unit was indicated to be lower than its carrying value. For this reporting\nunit, where it was determined that it was more likely than not that its fair value was less than the units’ carrying amount after performing the qualitative\nassessment, as a result, the Company performed the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test for these two reporting units.\nFor the two-step goodwill impairment test, the Company estimated the fair value with either income approach or asset approach for specific reporting unit\ncomponents. With the income approach, the Company estimates the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash\nflows are based on the best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected expansion, pricing, market share, and general\neconomic conditions. Certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models. Changes\nin these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. Asset based approach is used in evaluating the fair value of some\nspecific components which is deemed as the most prudent approach due to the unpredictability of future cash flows.\nThe result of step one impairment test for the Hitrans reporting unit failed, with its determined fair value lower than the book value. The Company\nperformed step two impairment test, applying the income approach, resulting an impairment loss of goodwill of $1,556,078 for the year ended December\n31, 2022. The impairment loss of goodwill was primarily attributable to the impairment related to Hitrans reporting unit as the financial performance of the\nreporting unit of Hitrans continued to fall below the Company’s original expectations.\n26\n14.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the\nmeasurement date. This topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when\nmeasuring fair value. Certain current assets and current liabilities are financial instruments. Management believes their carrying amounts are a reasonable\nestimate of fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and, if applicable, their\ncurrent interest rates are equivalent to interest rates currently available. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:\n● Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n● Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable\nfor the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.\n● Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nValuation of debt products depends upon a number of factors, including prevailing interest rates for like securities, expected volatility in future interest\nrates, and other relevant terms of the debt. Other factors that may be considered include the borrower’s ability to adequately service its debt, the fair market\nvalue of the borrower in relation to the face amount of its outstanding debt and the quality of collateral securing the Company’s debt investments. The fair\nvalue of these debt products classified as Level 2 is established by reference to the prices quoted by respective fund administrators.\nThe fair value of warrants was determined using the Binomial Model, with level 3 inputs (Note 27).\nThe fair value of share options was determined using the Binomial Model, with level 3 inputs (Note 25).\nThe carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, pledged deposits, trade accounts and bills receivable, other\nreceivables, balances with former subsidiaries, notes payable, other short-term loans, short-term and long-term bank loans and other payables approximate\ntheir fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments or the rate of interest of these instruments approximate the market rate of interest.\n24.

The fair value of options of the Company was $56,521 at the grant date.\nThe Company recorded non-cash share-based compensation expense of nil and $8,007 for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively, in\nrespect of the restricted share units and stock options granted on August 22, 2023.\nThe Company recorded non-cash share-based compensation expense of nil and $21,657 for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively, in\nrespect of the restricted share units and stock options granted on August 22, 2023.\nAs of June 30, 2024, non-vested restricted share units granted on August 22, 2023 are as follows:\nNon-vested share units as of August 22, 2023\nGranted 40,000\nVested (20,000)\nForfeited -\nNon-vested share units as of December 31, 2023 20,000\nVested (20,000)\nNon-vested share units as of June 30, 2024 -\nAs of June 30, 2024, there was unrecognized stock-based compensation $34,089 associated with the above options granted.\nStock option activity under the Company’s stock-based compensation plans is shown below:\nWeighted\nAverage\nAverage Aggregate Remaining\nNumber of Exercise Price Intrinsic Contractual\nShares per Share Value* Term in Years\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024 3,314,128 $ 1.30 $ - 4.3\nExercisable at January 1, 2024 549,958 $ 1.96 $ - 3.8\nGranted - - - -\nExercised - - - -\nForfeited (84,000) 0.98 - -\nOutstanding at June 30, 2024 3,230,128 $ 1.31 $ - 4.1\nExercisable at June 30, 2024 1,042,458 $ 1.5 $ - 3.8\n* The intrinsic value of the stock options at June 30, 2024 is the amount by which the market value of the Company’s common stock of $1.37 as of June\n30, 2024 exceeds the average exercise price of the option. As of Junen 30, 2024, the intrinsic value of the outstanding and exercisable stock options\nwas nil.\nAs the Company itself is an investment holding company which is not expected to generate operating profits to realize the tax benefits arising from its net\noperating loss carried forward, no income tax benefits were recognized for such stock-based compensation cost under the stock option plan for the three\nand six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024.\n42\n26.

Warrants\nOn December 8, 2020, the Company entered in a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional investors, pursuant to which the Company issued\nin a registered direct offering, an aggregate of 9,489,800 shares of its common stock at a price of $5.18 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds to the\nCompany of approximately $49 million, before deducting fees to the placement agent and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. As\npart of the transaction, the institutional investors also received warrants (“Investor Warrants”) for the purchase of up to 3,795,920 shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock at an exercise price of $6.46 per share exercisable for 36 months from the date of issuance. In addition, the placement agent for this\ntransaction also received warrants (“Placement Agent Warrants”) for the purchase of up to 379,592 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise\nprice of $6.475 per share exercisable for 36 months after 6 months from the issuance (collectively, the “2020 Warrants”). The Company has performed a\nthorough reassessment of the terms of its warrants with reference to the provisions of ASC Topic 815-40-15-7I, regarding its exposure to changes in\ncurrency exchange rates. This reassessment has led to the management’s conclusion that the Company’s warrants issued to the investors should not be\nconsidered indexed to the Company’s own stock because the warrants are denominated in U.S. dollar, which is different from the Company’s functional\ncurrency, Renminbi. Warrants are remeasured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings in each reporting period.\nOn February 8, 2021, the Company entered into another securities purchase agreement with the same investors, pursuant to which the Company issued in a\nregistered direct offering, an aggregate of 8,939,976 shares of common stock of the Company at a per share purchase price of $7.83. In addition, the\nCompany issued to the investors (i) in a concurrent private placement, the Series A-1 warrants to purchase a total of 4,469,988 shares of common stock, at\na per share exercise price of $7.67 and exercisable for 42 months from the date of issuance; (ii) in the registered direct offering, the Series B warrants to\npurchase a total of 4,469,988 shares of common stock, at a per share exercise price of $7.83 and exercisable for 90 days from the date of issuance; and (iii)\nin the registered direct offering, the Series A-2 warrants to purchase up to 2,234,992 shares of common stock, at a per share exercise price of $7.67 and\nexercisable for 45 months from the date of issuance. The Company received gross proceeds of approximately $70 million from the registered direct\noffering and the concurrent private placement, before deducting fees to the placement agent and other estimated offering expenses of $5.0 million payable\nby the Company. In addition, the placement agent for this transaction also received warrants (“Placement Agent Warrants”) for the purchase of up to\n446,999 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $9.204 per share exercisable for 36 months after 6 months from the issuance.\n43\nOn May 10, 2021, the Company entered into that Amendment No. 1 to the Series B Warrant (the “Series B Warrant Amendment”) with each of the holders\nof the Company’s outstanding Series B warrants. Pursuant to the Series B Warrant Amendment, the term of the Series B warrants was extended from May\n11, 2021 to August 31, 2021.\nAs of the date of this report, Series B warrant, along with Series A-2 warrants, had both expired. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had not received any\nnotices from investors to exercise the 2020 Warrants, which had also expired.\nThere was a total of 4,916,987 warrants issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2024.\nThe fair value of the outstanding warrants was calculated using Binomial Model based on backward induction with the following assumptions:\nWarrants issued in the 2020 Financing\nPlacement\nInvestor Agent\nWarrants Warrants\nDecember 31, December 31,\nAppraisal Date 2023 2023\nMarket price per share (USD/share) $ n/a $ 1.05\nExercise price (USD/price) n/a 6.475\nRisk free rate n/a 5.3%\nDividend yield n/a 0.0%\nExpected term/ Contractual life (years) n/a 0.4 years\nExpected volatility n/a 53.9%\nPlacement\nInvestor Agent\nWarrants Warrants\nJune 30, June 30,\nAppraisal Date 2024 2024\nMarket price per share (USD/share) $ n/a $ n/a\nExercise price (USD/price) n/a n/a\nRisk free rate n/a n/a\nDividend yield n/a n/a\nExpected term/ Contractual life (years) n/a n/a\nExpected volatility n/a n/a\n44\nWarrants issued in the 2021 Financing\nWarrants holder\nInvestor Placement\nWarrants Agent\nSeries A1 Warrants\nDecember 31, December 31,\nAppraisal Date 2023 2023\nMarket price per share (USD/share) 1.05 1.05\nExercise price (USD/price) 7.67 9.204\nRisk free rate 5.1% 5.1%\nDividend yield 0.0% 0.0%\nExpected term/ Contractual life (years) 0.6 year 0.6 year\nExpected volatility 63.0% 60.3%\nWarrants holder\nInvestor Placement\nWarrants Agent\nSeries A1 Warrants\nJune 30, June 30,\nAppraisal Date 2024 2024\nMarket price per share (USD/share) 1.37 1.37\nExercise price (USD/price) 7.67 9.204\nRisk free rate 5.3% 5.3%\nDividend yield 0.0% 0.0%\nExpected term/ Contractual life (years) 0.1 years 0.1 years\nExpected volatility 118.6% 118.6%\nThe following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of warrants liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs:\nDecember 31, June 30,\n2023 2024\nBalance at the beginning of the year/ period $ 136,000 $ -\nWarrants issued to institution investors - -\nWarrants issued to placement agent - -\nWarrants redeemed - -\nFair value change of the issued warrants included in earnings (136,000) -\nBalance at end of year/ period - -\nThe following is a summary of the warrant activity:\nWeighted\nAverage\nRemaining\nNumber of Average Contractual\nWarrants Exercise Price Term in Years\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024 5,296,579 $ 7.71 0.60\nExercisable at January 1, 2024 5,296,579 $ 7.71 0.60\nGranted - - -\nExercised / surrendered - - -\nExpired (379,592) 6.475 -\nOutstanding at June 30, 2024 4,916,987 $ 7.809 0.11\nExercisable at June 30, 2024 4,916,987 $ 7.809 0.11\n45\n28.

Other than the legal proceedings set forth below, the\nCompany is currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that the Company believe will have an adverse effect on the Company’s operation,\nfinancial condition or operating results.\nIn December 2020, CBAK Power received notice from Court of Dalian Economic and Technology Development Zone that Haoneng filed another lawsuit\nagainst CBAK Power for failure to pay pursuant to the terms of the purchase contract. Haoneng sought a total amount of $1,613,984 (RMB10,257,030),\nincluding equipment cost of $1,427,515 (RMB9,072,000) and interest amount of $186,469 (RMB1,185,030). In August 2021, CBAK Power and Haoneng\nreached an agreement that the term of the purchase contract will be extended to December 31, 2023 under which CBAK Power and its related parties shall\nexecute the purchase of equipment in an amount not lower than $2.4 million (RMB15,120,000) from Haoneng, or CBAK Power has to pay 15% of the\namount equal to RMB15,120,000 ($2.4 million) net of the purchased amount to Haoneng. Haoneng withdrew the filed lawsuit after the agreement.

Our primary product\nofferings consist of new energy high power lithium batteries and sodium batteries. In addition, after completing the acquisition of 81.56% of registered\nequity interests (representing 75.57% of paid-up capital) of Hitrans in November 2021, we entered the business of developing and manufacturing NCM\nprecursor and cathode materials. Hitrans is a leading developer and manufacturer of ternary precursor and cathode materials in China, whose products have\na wide range of applications including electric vehicles, electric tools, high-end digital products and storage, among others.\nWe acquired our operating assets, including customers, employees, patents and technologies from our former subsidiary BAK International (Tianjin) Ltd.\nWe acquired these assets in exchange for a reduction in accounts receivable from our former subsidiaries that were disposed of in June 2014.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we report financial and operational information in two segments: (i) production of high-power lithium and sodium battery cells and\n(ii) manufacture and sales of materials used in high power lithium battery cells.\nWe currently conduct our business primarily through (i) CBAK Power, (ii) Nanjing CBAK, (iii) CBAK Shangqiu, (iv) Nanjing BFD, and (v) Hitrans.\nAs disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed on March 15, 2024 and other reports filed with the\nSEC, we started construction of our Nanjing facilities to expand our lithium battery manufacturing capabilities in 2020. The project comprises two phases.\nPhase I, encompassing an area of approximately 27,173 square meters, was put into operation in the second half of 2021. Since then, we have been steadily\nincreasing Phase I’s production capacity, which currently stands at 2 GWh. Construction of the Phase II began in 2022 and includes three major\nmanufacturing plants. The construction of the ceiling stage for the first of these three plants in Phase II was completed in 2023, and we anticipate it will\ncommence operations in 2025. Once fully operational, the Nanjing facilities are projected to provide a total capacity of 20 GWh to support our customers’\ngrowing demand. In 2023, our client demand for batteries soared, prompting us to rent additional manufacturing space in Shangqiu, Henan, PRC. Our\nShangqiu facility has a capacity of 0.5 GWh per year. We have two production lines at this leased facility, and the renovation costs were covered by the\nowner. We have been expanding our business by developing new products, fostering new partnerships and strategic acquisition of companies that\ncomplement and augment our business.\nThe clean energy industry is of strategic importance in China and many other countries. With the global emphasis on the new energy industry, we anticipate\nsecuring more potential orders from our clients. The Chinese government has been providing support for the development of new energy facilities and\nvehicles for several years. Considering our major operations are in China, the policy support to the new energy industry is crucial to our business. With the\ngrowing demand for high-power lithium-ion and sodium-ion products, we are optimistic about our future prospects.\n51\nFinancial Performance Highlights for the Quarter Ended June 30, 2024\nThe following are some financial highlights for the quarter ended June 30, 2024:\n● (cid:0)1 (cid:0)H (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)X (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:29) Net revenues increased by $5.4 million, or 13%, to $47.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, from $42.4 million for\nthe same period in 2023.\n● (cid:0)* (cid:0)U (cid:0)R (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S (cid:0)U (cid:0)R (cid:0)I(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:29)(cid:0)(cid:3)Gross profit was $12.7 million, representing an increase of $8.8 million, for the three months ended June 30, 2024 from gross profit\nof $3.9 million for the same period in 2023.\n● (cid:0)2 (cid:0)S (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)O(cid:0)R (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:29) Operating income was $5.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, reflecting an increase in income of $9.7\nmillion from an operating loss of $3.8 million for the same period in 2023.\n● (cid:0)1 (cid:0)H (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)O(cid:0)R (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:29)(cid:0)(cid:3)Net income was $6.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $2.6 million for the same\nperiod in 2023.\n● (cid:0)) (cid:0)X (cid:0)O(cid:0)O(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)G (cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)X (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:11)(cid:0)O(cid:0)R (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)S (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V (cid:0)K (cid:0)D (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:29)(cid:0)(cid:3)Fully diluted income per share was $0.07 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to fully\ndiluted loss per share of $0.03 for the same period in 2023.\nFinancial Statement Presentation\n(cid:0)1 (cid:0)H (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3) (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)X (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:17)(cid:0)(cid:3) The Company recognizes revenues when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the\nconsideration which it expects to receive in exchange for those goods.

Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the\nreports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms\nof the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures,\nmanagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving\nthe desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures.\nManagement conducted its evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial\nOfficer. Based upon, and as of the date of this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls\nand procedures were ineffective as of June 30, 2024.\nAs we disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024, during our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control\nover financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting:\n● We did not have appropriate policies and procedures in place to evaluate the proper accounting and disclosures of key documents and agreements.\n● We do not have sufficient and skilled accounting personnel with an appropriate level of technical accounting knowledge and experience in the\napplication of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States commensurate with our financial reporting requirements.\nIn order to cure the foregoing material weaknesses, we have taken or are taking the following remediation measures:\n● We are in the process of hiring a permanent chief financial officer with significant U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience. Ms. Xiangyu Pei\nwas appointed by the Board of Directors of the Company as the Interim Chief Financial Officer on August 23, 2019. Ms. Xiangyu Pei resigned as\nour Interim Chief Financial Officer on August 22, 2023 but has continued to serve in the Company’s finance department and on the board of\ndirector. Mr. Jiewei Li was appointed as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer on August 22, 2023.\n● We have regularly offered our financial personnel trainings on internal control and risk management. We have regularly provided trainings to our\nfinancial personnel on U.S. GAAP accounting guidelines. We plan to continue to provide trainings to our financial team and our other relevant\npersonnel on the U.S. GAAP accounting guidelines applicable to our financial reporting requirements.\nWe intend to complete the remediation of the material weaknesses discussed above as soon as practicable but we can give no assurance that we will be able\nto do so. Designing and implementing an effective disclosure controls and procedures is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to\nchanges in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to devote significant resources to maintain a financial reporting system that\nadequately satisfies our reporting obligations. The remedial measures that we have taken and intend to take may not fully address the material weakness\nthat we have identified.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nExcept for the matters described above, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 that\nhave materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n64\nPART II\nOTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1.

Principal Activities, Basis of Presentation and Organization\nPrincipal Activities\nCBAK Energy Technology, Inc. (formerly known as China BAK Battery, Inc.) (“CBAK” or the “Company”) is a corporation formed in the State of Nevada\non October 4, 1999 as Medina Copy, Inc. The Company changed its name to Medina Coffee, Inc. on October 6, 1999 and subsequently changed its name to\nChina BAK Battery, Inc. on February 14, 2005. CBAK and its subsidiaries (hereinafter, collectively referred to as the “Company”) are principally engaged\nin the manufacture, commercialization and distribution of a wide variety of standard and customized lithium ion (known as “Li-ion” or “Li-ion cell”) high\npower rechargeable batteries. Prior to the disposal of BAK International Limited (“BAK International”) and its subsidiaries (see below), the batteries\nproduced by the Company were for use in cellular telephones, as well as various other portable electronic applications, including high-power handset\ntelephones, laptop computers, power tools, digital cameras, video camcorders, MP3 players, electric bicycles, hybrid/electric vehicles, and general\nindustrial applications. After the disposal of BAK International and its subsidiaries on June 30, 2014, the Company will focus on the manufacture,\ncommercialization and distribution of high power lithium ion rechargeable batteries for use in cordless power tools, light electric vehicles, hybrid electric\nvehicles, electric cars, electric busses, uninterruptable power supplies and other high power applications.\nThe shares of the Company traded in the over-the-counter market through the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board from 2005 until May 31, 2006, when the\nCompany obtained approval to list its common stock on The NASDAQ Global Market, and trading commenced that same date under the symbol “CBAK”.\nOn January 10, 2017, the Company filed Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of Nevada to effectuate a merger between the Company and the\nCompany’s newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary, CBAK Merger Sub, Inc. (the “Merger Sub”). According to the Articles of Merger, effective January\n16, 2017, the Merger Sub merged with and into the Company with the Company being the surviving entity (the “Merger”). As permitted by Chapter\n92A.180 of Nevada Revised Statutes, the sole purpose of the Merger was to effect a change of the Company’s name.\nEffective November 30, 2018, the trading symbol for common stock of the Company was changed from CBAK to CBAT. Effective at the opening of\nbusiness on June 21, 2019, the Company’s common stock started trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nBasis of Presentation and Organization\nOn November 6, 2004, BAK International, a non-operating holding company that had substantially the same shareholders as Shenzhen BAK Battery Co.,\nLtd (“Shenzhen BAK”), entered into a share swap transaction with the shareholders of Shenzhen BAK for the purpose of the subsequent reverse acquisition\nof the Company. The share swap transaction between BAK International and the shareholders of Shenzhen BAK was accounted for as a reverse acquisition\nof Shenzhen BAK with no adjustment to the historical basis of the assets and liabilities of Shenzhen BAK.\nOn January 20, 2005, the Company completed a share swap transaction with the shareholders of BAK International. The share swap transaction, also\nreferred to as the “reverse acquisition” of the Company, was consummated under Nevada law pursuant to the terms of a Securities Exchange Agreement\nentered by and among CBAK, BAK International and the shareholders of BAK International on January 20, 2005. The share swap transaction has been\naccounted for as a capital-raising transaction of the Company whereby the historical financial statements and operations of Shenzhen BAK are consolidated\nusing historical carrying amounts.\n6\nAlso on January 20, 2005, immediately prior to consummating the share swap transaction, BAK International executed a private placement of its common\nstock with unrelated investors whereby it issued an aggregate of 1,720,087 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $17,000,000. In conjunction with\nthis financing, Mr. Xiangqian Li, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company (“Mr. Li”) until March 1, 2016, agreed to place 435,910\nshares of the Company’s common stock owned by him into an escrow account pursuant to an Escrow Agreement dated January 20, 2005 (the “Escrow\nAgreement”). Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, 50% of the escrowed shares were to be released to the investors in the private placement if audited net\nincome of the Company for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 was not at least $12,000,000, and the remaining 50% was to be released to investors\nin the private placement if audited net income of the Company for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 was not at least $27,000,000. If the audited net\nincome of the Company for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2006 reached the above-mentioned targets, the 435,910 shares would be\nreleased to Mr. Li in the amount of 50% upon reaching the 2005 target and the remaining 50% upon reaching the 2006 target.\nUnder accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”), escrow agreements such as the one established by Mr. Li\ngenerally constitute compensation if, following attainment of a performance threshold, shares are returned to a company officer. The Company determined\nthat without consideration of the compensation charge, the performance thresholds for the year ended September 30, 2005 would be achieved. However,\nafter consideration of a related compensation charge, the Company determined that such thresholds would not have been achieved. The Company also\ndetermined that, even without consideration of a compensation charge, the performance thresholds for the year ended September 30, 2006 would not be\nachieved.\nWhile the 217,955 escrow shares relating to the 2005 performance threshold were previously released to Mr. Li, Mr. Li executed a further undertaking on\nAugust 21, 2006 to return those shares to the escrow agent for the distribution to the relevant investors. However, such shares were not returned to the\nescrow agent, but, pursuant to a Delivery of Make Good Shares, Settlement and Release Agreement between the Company, BAK International and Mr. Li\nentered into on October 22, 2007 (the “Li Settlement Agreement”), such shares were ultimately delivered to the Company as described below. Because the\nCompany failed to satisfy the performance threshold for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, the remaining 217,955 escrow shares relating to the\nfiscal year 2006 performance threshold were released to the relevant investors. As Mr. Li has not retained any of the shares placed into escrow, and as the\ninvestors party to the Escrow Agreement are only shareholders of the Company and do not have and are not expected to have any other relationship to the\nCompany, the Company has not recorded a compensation charge for the years ended September 30, 2005 and 2006.\nAt the time the escrow shares relating to the 2006 performance threshold were transferred to the investors in fiscal year 2007, the Company should have\nrecognized a credit to donated shares and a debit to additional paid-in capital, both of which are elements of shareholders’ equity. This entry is not material\nbecause total ordinary shares issued and outstanding, total shareholders’ equity and total assets do not change; nor is there any impact on income or\nearnings per share. Therefore, previously filed consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 will not be restated. This\nshare transfer has been reflected in these financial statements by reclassifying the balances of certain items as of October 1, 2007. The balances of donated\nshares and additional paid-in capital as of October 1, 2007 were credited and debited by $7,955,358 respectively, as set out in the consolidated statements\nof changes in shareholders’ equity.\nIn November 2007, Mr. Li delivered the 217,955 shares related to the 2005 performance threshold to BAK International pursuant to the Li Settlement\nAgreement; BAK International in turn delivered the shares to the Company. Such shares (other than those issued to investors pursuant to the 2008\nSettlement Agreements, as described below) are now held by the Company. Upon receipt of these shares, the Company and BAK International released all\nclaims and causes of action against Mr. Li regarding the shares, and Mr. Li released all claims and causes of action against the Company and BAK\nInternational regarding the shares. Under the terms of the Li Settlement Agreement, the Company commenced negotiations with the investors who\nparticipated in the Company’s January 2005 private placement in order to achieve a complete settlement of BAK International’s obligations (and the\nCompany’s obligations to the extent it has any) under the applicable agreements with such investors.\nBeginning on March 13, 2008, the Company entered into settlement agreements (the “2008 Settlement Agreements”) with certain investors in the January\n2005 private placement. Since the other investors have never submitted any claims regarding this matter, the Company did not reach any settlement with\nthem.\n7\nPursuant to the 2008 Settlement Agreements, the Company and the settling investors have agreed, without any admission of liability, to a settlement and\nmutual release from all claims relating to the January 2005 private placement, including all claims relating to the escrow shares related to the 2005\nperformance threshold that had been placed into escrow by Mr. Li, as well as all claims, including claims for liquidated damages relating to registration\nrights granted in connection with the January 2005 private placement. Under the 2008 Settlement Agreement, the Company has made settlement payments\nto each of the settling investors of the number of shares of the Company’s common stock equivalent to 50% of the number of the escrow shares related to\nthe 2005 performance threshold these investors had claimed; aggregate settlement payments as of June 30, 2015amounted to 73,749 shares. Share\npayments to date have been made in reliance upon the exemptions from registration provided by Section 4(2) and/or other applicable provisions of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended. In accordance with the 2008 Settlement Agreements, the Company filed a registration statement covering the resale of\nsuch shares which was declared effective by the SEC on June 26, 2008.\nPursuant to the Li Settlement Agreement, the 2008 Settlement Agreements and upon the release of the 217,955 escrow shares relating to the fiscal year\n2006 performance threshold to the relevant investors, neither Mr. Li or the Company have any obligations to the investors who participated in the\nCompany’s January 2005 private placement relating to the escrow shares.\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company had not received any claim from the other investors who have not been covered by the “2008 Settlement Agreements”\nin the January 2005 private placement.\nAs the Company has transferred the 217,955 shares related to the 2006 performance threshold to the relevant investors in fiscal year 2007 and the Company\nalso have transferred 73,749 shares relating to the 2005 performance threshold to the investors who had entered the “2008 Settlement Agreements” with us\nin fiscal year 2008, pursuant to “Li Settlement Agreement” and “2008 Settlement Agreements”, neither Mr. Li nor the Company had any remaining\nobligations to those related investors who participated in the Company’s January 2005 private placement relating to the escrow shares.\nOn August 14, 2013, Dalian BAK Trading Co., Ltd was established as a wholly owned subsidiary of China BAK Asia Holding Limited (“BAK Asia”) with\na registered capital of $500,000.

Actual results could differ from those estimates. This basis of accounting differs in certain material\nrespects from that used for the preparation of the books of account of the Company and its subsidiaries, which are prepared in accordance with the\naccounting principles and the relevant financial regulations applicable to enterprises with limited liability established in the PRC or Hong Kong. The\naccompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect necessary adjustments not recorded in the books of account of the Company’s\nsubsidiaries to present them in conformity with US GAAP.\nOn December 8, 2020, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional investors, pursuant to which the Company\nissued in a registered direct offering, an aggregate of 9,489,800 shares of common stock of the Company at a per share purchase price of $5.18, and\nwarrants to purchase an aggregate of 3,795,920 shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $6.46 per share exercisable for 36 months\nfrom the date of issuance, for gross proceeds of approximately $49.16 million, before deducting fees to the placement agent and other estimated offering\nexpenses of $3.81 million payable by the Company.

Pursuant to the Series B Warrant Amendment, the term of the Series B warrants was extended from May\n11, 2021 to August 31, 2021.\nAs of August 31, 2021, the Company had not received any notices from the investors to exercise Series B warrants. As of the date of this report, Series B\nwarrants, along with Series A-2 warrants, had both expired.\n11\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company had $36.1 million bank loans and approximately $120.0 million of other current liabilities.\nThe Company is currently expanding its product lines and manufacturing capacity in its Dalian, Nanjing and Zhejiang plant which requires more funding to\nfinance the expansion. The Company plans to raise additional funds through banks borrowings and equity financing in the future to meet its daily cash\ndemands, if required.\nCOVID-19\nThe Company business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or other health epidemics and outbreaks. A wave\nof infections caused by the Omicron variant emerged in Shanghai in early 2022, and a series of restrictions and quarantines were implemented to contain\nthe spread in Shanghai and other regions. The Company’s manufacturing facilities in Dalian, Nanjing and Shaoxing were not producing at full capacity\nwhen restrictive measures were in force during 2022, which negatively affected our operational and financial results. China began to modify its zero-\nCOVID policy at the end of 2022, and most of the travel restrictions and quarantine requirements were lifted in December 2022.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that will continue to have on the Company’s business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict and\nquantify, as the actions that the Company, other businesses and governments may take to contain the spread of COVID-19 continue to evolve. Because of\nthe significant uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the extent of the future business interruption and the related financial impact cannot be\nreasonably estimated at this time.\nThe severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business will continue to depend on a number of factors, including, but not\nlimited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic, the new variants of COVID-19, the efficacy and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and the extent\nand severity of the impact on the global supply chain and the Company’s customers, service providers and suppliers, all of which are uncertain and cannot\nbe reasonably predicted at this time. As of the date of issuance of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements, the extent to which the\nCOVID-19 pandemic may in the future materially impact the Company’s financial condition, liquidity or results of operations is uncertain. The Company is\nmonitoring and assessing the evolving situation closely and evaluating its potential exposure.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The\nCompany has accumulated deficit from net losses from prior year and significant short-term debt obligations maturing in less than one year as of March 31,\n2024. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s plan for continuing as a going\nconcern included improving its profitability, and obtaining additional debt financing, loans from existing directors and shareholders for additional funding\nto meet its operating needs. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in the plans described above or in attracting equity or\nalternative financing on acceptable terms, or if at all. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the\nrecoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to\ncontinue as a going concern.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenues when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which it\nexpects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company recognizes revenues following the five step model prescribed under ASU No. 2014-09: (i)\nidentify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the\ntransaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation.\nRevenues from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of the Company’s product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon\ndelivery to the customer. The Company expenses incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the\nasset that it would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial.\n12\nRevenues from product sales are recorded net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances that are offered within contracts with the\nCompany’s customers.\nProduct revenue reserves, which are classified as a reduction in product revenues, are generally characterized in the categories: discounts and returns. These\nreserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable as the\namount is payable to the Company’s customer.\nContract liability\nThe Company’s contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue associated with batteries development and deposits received from customers allocated to the\nperformance obligations that are unsatisfied. Changes in contract liability balances were not materially impacted by business acquisition, change in\nestimate of transaction price or any other factors during any of the years presented. The table below presents the activity of the deferred batteries\ndevelopment and sales of batteries revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024 respectively:\nMarch 31\n2023 2024\nBalance at beginning of the year $ 1,869,525 $ 784,000\nDevelopment fees collected/ deposits received - -\nDevelopment and sales of batteries revenue recognized - -\nForeign exchange adjustment 6,353 -\nBalance at end of period $ 1,875,878 $ 784,000\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from\nContracts with Customers, which requires the recognition and measurement of contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in\naccordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This creates an exception to the general recognition and measurement principles in\nASC 805. As a smaller reporting company, ASU 2021-08 will be effective for the Company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted.

This ASU will be effective\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and\nannual financial statements that have not yet been made available for issuance. An entity may apply ASU 2023-01 either prospectively or retrospectively.\nThe adoption did not have material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement.\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-02, Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax\nCredit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method, that is intended to improve the accounting and disclosures for investments in tax credit\nstructures. This ASU allows reporting entities to elect to account for qualifying tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method,\nregardless of the program giving rise to the related income tax credits. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for all entities in any interim period. The adoption\ndid not have material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement.\n13\nRecently Issued But Not Yet Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-06 to clarify or improve disclosure and presentation requirements of a variety of\ntopics, which will allow users to more easily compare entities subject to the SEC’s existing disclosures with those entities that were not previously subject\nto the requirements, and align the requirements in the FASB accounting standard codification with the SEC’s regulations. The Company is currently\nevaluating the provisions of the amendments and the impact on its condensed consolidated financial statement presentations and disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280). This ASU updates reportable\nsegment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating\nDecision Maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of a segment’s profit or loss. This ASU also requires disclosure of the title and\nposition of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment’s profit or loss in\nassessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and\ninterim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Adoption of the ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods\npresented in the financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted. This ASU will likely result in us including the additional required disclosures when\nadopted. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of the amendments and the impact on its condensed consolidated financial statement\npresentations and disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated\ninformation about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective on a\nprospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet\nbeen issued or made available for issuance. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of the amendments and the impact on its condensed\nconsolidated financial statement presentations and disclosures.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date\nare not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\n2.

Goodwill is attributed to the premium that the Company paid to obtain the value of the business of Hitrans and the synergies\nexpected from the combined operations of Hitrans and the Company, the assembled workforce and their knowledge and experience in provision of raw\nmaterials used in manufacturing of lithium batteries. The total amount of the goodwill acquired is not deductible for tax purposes.\nThe Company performed Goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests when an event occurs or\ncircumstances change indicating the asset might be impaired.

Goodwill\nBalance as of January 1, 2023 $ -\nImpairment of goodwill -\nForeign exchange adjustment -\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024 $ -\nThe Company performed goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests when an event occurs or\ncircumstances change indicating the asset might be impaired. As of December 31, 2022, the Company performed testing on reporting unit of NCM\nprecursor and cathode materials products (“Hitrans Reporting unit”)\nThe Company first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying\namount. For those reporting units where it is determined that it is more likely than not that their fair values are less than the units’ carrying amounts, the\nCompany will perform the first step of a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. After performing the assessment, if the carrying amounts of the\nreporting units are higher than their fair values, the Company will perform the second step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.\nThe Company performed qualitative assessments for Hitrans reporting unit. Based on the requirements of ASC 350-20-35-3C through ASC 350-20-35-3G,\nthe Company evaluated all relevant factors, weighed all factors in their totality. For the year ended December 31, 2022, as the financial performance of\nHitrans reporting unit was below original expectations, fair value of this reporting unit was indicated to be lower than its carrying value. For this reporting\nunit, where it was determined that it was more likely than not that its fair value was less than the units’ carrying amount after performing the qualitative\nassessment, as a result, the Company performed the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test for these two reporting units.\n24\nFor the two-step goodwill impairment test, the Company estimated the fair value with either income approach or asset approach for specific reporting unit\ncomponents. With the income approach, the Company estimates the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash\nflows are based on the best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected expansion, pricing, market share, and general\neconomic conditions. Certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models. Changes\nin these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. Asset based approach is used in evaluating the fair value of some\nspecific components which is deemed as the most prudent approach due to the unpredictability of future cash flows.\nThe result of step one impairment test for the Hitrans reporting unit failed, with its determined fair value lower than the book value. The Company\nperformed step two impairment test, applying the income approach, resulting an impairment loss of goodwill of $1,556,078 for the year ended December\n31, 2022. The impairment loss of goodwill was primarily attributable to the impairment related to Hitrans reporting unit as the financial performance of the\nreporting unit of Hitrans continued to fall below the Company’s original expectations.\n14.

Management believes it is more likely than not that\nthe Company will not realize these potential tax benefits as these operations will not generate any operating profits in the foreseeable future. As a result, a\nvaluation allowance was provided against the full amount of the potential tax benefits.\nAccording to the PRC Tax Administration and Collection Law, the statute of limitations is three years if the underpayment of taxes is due to computational\nerrors made by the taxpayer or its withholding agent. The statute of limitations extends to five years under special circumstances, which are not clearly\ndefined. In the case of a related party transaction, the statute of limitations is ten years. There is no statute of limitations in the case of tax evasion.\nThe impact of an uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be\nsustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority.

Interest and penalties on income taxes will be classified as a component of the provisions for income taxes.\n22. Statutory reserves\nAs stipulated by the relevant laws and regulations in the PRC, company established in the PRC (the “PRC subsidiary”) is required to maintain a statutory\nreserve made out of profit for the year based on the PRC subsidiary’ statutory financial statements which are prepared in accordance with the accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the PRC. The amount and allocation basis are decided by the director of the PRC subsidiary annually and is not to be less\nthan 10% of the profit for the year of the PRC subsidiary. The aggregate amount allocated to the reserves will be limited to 50% of registered capital for\ncertain subsidiaries. Statutory reserve can be used for expanding the capital base of the PRC subsidiary by means of capitalization issue.\nIn addition, as a result of the relevant PRC laws and regulations which impose restriction on distribution or transfer of assets out of the PRC statutory\nreserve, $1,230,511 representing the PRC statutory reserve of the subsidiary as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, are also considered under\nrestriction for distribution.\n35\n23. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the\nmeasurement date. This topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when\nmeasuring fair value. Certain current assets and current liabilities are financial instruments. Management believes their carrying amounts are a reasonable\nestimate of fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and, if applicable, their\ncurrent interest rates are equivalent to interest rates currently available. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:\n● Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n● Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable\nfor the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.\n● Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nValuation of debt products depends upon a number of factors, including prevailing interest rates for like securities, expected volatility in future interest\nrates, and other relevant terms of the debt. Other factors that may be considered include the borrower’s ability to adequately service its debt, the fair market\nvalue of the borrower in relation to the face amount of its outstanding debt and the quality of collateral securing the Company’s debt investments. The fair\nvalue of these debt products classified as Level 2 is established by reference to the prices quoted by respective fund administrators.\nThe fair value of warrants was determined using the Binomial Model, with level 3 inputs (Note 27).\nThe fair value of share options was determined using the Binomial Model, with level 3 inputs (Note 25).\nThe carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, pledged deposits, trade accounts and bills receivable, other\nreceivables, balances with former subsidiaries, notes payable, other short-term loans, short-term and long-term bank loans and other payables approximate\ntheir fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments or the rate of interest of these instruments approximate the market rate of interest.\n24. Employee Benefit Plan\nFull time employees of the Company in the PRC participate in a government mandated defined contribution plan, pursuant to which certain pension\nbenefits, medical care, employee housing fund and other welfare benefits are provided to the employees. The Company accrues for these benefits based on\ncertain percentages of the employees’ salaries, up to a maximum amount specified by the local government. The total employee benefits expensed as\nincurred were $617,793 (RMB4,227,123) and $1,798,803 (RMB12,903,713) for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively.\n25.

During the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024, the Company recorded $6,893 as share-based compensation expenses.\nAs of March 31, 2024, non-vested restricted share units granted on August 22, 2023 are as follows:\nNon-vested share units as of August 22, 2023\nGranted 40,000\nVested (20,000)\nForfeited -\nNon-vested share units as of December 31, 2023 & March 31, 2024 20,000\nAs of March 31, 2024, there was unrecognized stock-based compensation $1,114 associated with the above restricted share units and options granted and\nnil vested shares were to be issued.\n38\nStock option activity under the Company’s stock-based compensation plans is shown below:\nWeighted\nAverage\nAverage Aggregate Remaining\nNumber of Exercise Price Intrinsic Contractual\nShares per Share Value* Term in Years\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024 3,314,128 $ 1.30 $ - 4.3\nExercisable at January 1, 2024 549,958 $ 1.96 $ - 3.8\nGranted - - - -\nExercised - - - -\nForfeited - - - -\nOutstanding at March 31, 2024 3,314,128 $ 1.30 $ - 4.2\nExercisable at March 31, 2024 549,958 $ 1.96 $ - 3.5\n* The intrinsic value of the stock options at March 31, 2024 is the amount by which the market value of the Company’s common stock of $1.04 as of\nMarch 31, 2024 exceeds the average exercise price of the option. As of March 31, 2024, the intrinsic value of the outstanding and exercisable stock\noptions was nil.\nAs the Company itself is an investment holding company which is not expected to generate operating profits to realize the tax benefits arising from its net\noperating loss carried forward, no income tax benefits were recognized for such stock-based compensation cost under the stock option plan for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023 and 2024.\n26. Income (Loss) Per Share\nThe following is the calculation of income (loss) per share:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n2023 2024\nNet (loss) income $ (2,204,482) $ 9,572,474\nLess: Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests 824,127 263,976\nNet (loss) income attributable to shareholders of CBAK Energy Technology, Inc.

Warrants\nOn December 8, 2020, the Company entered in a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional investors, pursuant to which the Company issued\nin a registered direct offering, an aggregate of 9,489,800 shares of its common stock at a price of $5.18 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds to the\nCompany of approximately $49 million, before deducting fees to the placement agent and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. As\npart of the transaction, the institutional investors also received warrants (“Investor Warrants”) for the purchase of up to 3,795,920 shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock at an exercise price of $6.46 per share exercisable for 36 months from the date of issuance. In addition, the placement agent for this\ntransaction also received warrants (“Placement Agent Warrants”) for the purchase of up to 379,592 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise\nprice of $6.475 per share exercisable for 36 months after 6 months from the issuance. The Company has performed a thorough reassessment of the terms of\nits warrants with reference to the provisions of ASC Topic 815-40-15-7I, regarding its exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. This reassessment\nhas led to the management’s conclusion that the Company’s warrants issued to the investors should not be considered indexed to the Company’s own stock\nbecause the warrants are denominated in U.S. dollar, which is different from the Company’s functional currency, Renminbi. Warrants are remeasured at fair\nvalue with changes in fair value recorded in earnings in each reporting period.\nOn February 8, 2021, the Company entered into another securities purchase agreement with the same investors, pursuant to which the Company issued in a\nregistered direct offering, an aggregate of 8,939,976 shares of common stock of the Company at a per share purchase price of $7.83. In addition, the\nCompany issued to the investors (i) in a concurrent private placement, the Series A-1 warrants to purchase a total of 4,469,988 shares of common stock, at\na per share exercise price of $7.67 and exercisable for 42 months from the date of issuance; (ii) in the registered direct offering, the Series B warrants to\npurchase a total of 4,469,988 shares of common stock, at a per share exercise price of $7.83 and exercisable for 90 days from the date of issuance; and (iii)\nin the registered direct offering, the Series A-2 warrants to purchase up to 2,234,992 shares of common stock, at a per share exercise price of $7.67 and\nexercisable for 45 months from the date of issuance. The Company received gross proceeds of approximately $70 million from the registered direct\noffering and the concurrent private placement, before deducting fees to the placement agent and other estimated offering expenses of $5.0 million payable\nby the Company. In addition, the placement agent for this transaction also received warrants (“Placement Agent Warrants”) for the purchase of up to\n446,999 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $9.204 per share exercisable for 36 months after 6 months from the issuance.\nOn May 10, 2021, the Company entered into that Amendment No. 1 to the Series B Warrant (the “Series B Warrant Amendment”) with each of the holders\nof the Company’s outstanding Series B warrants. Pursuant to the Series B Warrant Amendment, the term of the Series B warrants was extended from May\n11, 2021 to August 31, 2021.\nAs of the date of this report, Series B warrant, along with Series A-2 warrants, had both expired.\nThere was a total of 5,296,579 warrants issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2024.\nThe fair value of the outstanding warrants was calculated using Binomial Model based on backward induction with the following assumptions:\nWarrants issued in the 2020 Financing\nDecember 31, December 31,\nAppraisal Date 2023 2023\nMarket price per share (USD/share) $ n/a $ 1.05\nExercise price (USD/price) n/a 6.475\nRisk free rate n/a 5.3%\nDividend yield n/a 0.0%\nExpected term/ Contractual life (years) n/a 0.4 years\nExpected volatility n/a 53.9%\nMarch 31, March 31,\nAppraisal Date 2024 2024\nMarket price per share (USD/share) $ n/a $ 1.04\nExercise price (USD/price) n/a 6.475\nRisk free rate n/a 5.4%\nDividend yield n/a 0.0\nExpected term/ Contractual life (years) n/a 0.2 years\nExpected volatility n/a 54.8%\n40\nWarrants issued in the 2021 Financing\nWarrants holder\nInvestor Placement\nWarrants Agent\nSeries A1 Warrants\nDecember 31, December 31,\nAppraisal Date 2023 2023\nMarket price per share (USD/share) 1.05 1.05\nExercise price (USD/price) 7.67 9.204\nRisk free rate 5.1% 5.1%\nDividend yield 0.0% 0.0%\nExpected term/ Contractual life (years) 0.6 year 0.6 year\nExpected volatility 63.0% 60.3%\nWarrants holder\nInvestor Placement\nWarrants Agent\nSeries A1 Warrants\nMarch 31, March 31,\nAppraisal Date 2024 2024\nMarket price per share (USD/share) 1.04 1.04\nExercise price (USD/price) 7.67 9.204\nRisk free rate 5.3% 5.3%\nDividend yield 0.0% 0.0%\nExpected term/ Contractual life (years) 0.4 years 0.4 years\nExpected volatility 58.4% 58.4%\nThe following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of warrants liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs:\nDecember 31, March 31,\n2023 2024\nBalance at the beginning of the year/ period $ 136,000 $ -\nWarrants issued to institution investors - -\nWarrants issued to placement agent - -\nWarrants redeemed - -\nFair value change of the issued warrants included in earnings (136,000) -\nBalance at end of year/ period - -\n41\nThe following is a summary of the warrant activity:\nWeighted\nAverage\nRemaining\nNumber of Average Contractual\nWarrants Exercise Price Term in Years\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024 5,296,579 $ 7.71 0.60\nExercisable at January 1, 2024 5,296,579 $ 7.71 0.60\nGranted - - -\nExercised / surrendered - - -\nExpired - - -\nOutstanding at March 31, 2024 5,296,579 $ 7.71 0.35\nExercisable at March 31, 2024 5,296,579 $ 7.71 0.35\n28.

Hitrans is a leading developer and manufacturer of ternary precursor and cathode materials in China, whose products have\na wide range of applications in batteries used in electric vehicles, electric tools, high-end digital products and storage, among others.\nWe acquired most of the operating assets of CBAK Power, including customers, employees, patents and technologies from our former subsidiary BAK\nInternational (Tianjin) Ltd. (“BAK Tianjin”). We acquired these assets in exchange for a reduction in accounts receivable from our former subsidiaries that\nwere disposed of in June 2014.\nAs of March 31, 2024, we report financial and operational information in two segments: (i) production of high-power lithium and sodium battery cells and\n(ii) manufacture and sale of materials used in high-power lithium battery cells.\nWe currently conduct our business primarily through (i) CBAK Power, a wholly-owned subsidiary in China that we own through BAK Asia, an investment\nholding company formed under the laws of Hong Kong on July 9, 2013; (ii) Nanjing CBAK, a 100% owned subsidiary of CBAK Nanjing; (iii) CBAK\nShangqiu, a wholly owned subsidiary in China that we own through CBAK Power; (iv) Nanjing BFD, a 100% owned subsidiary of CBAK Nanjing; and\n(v) Hitrans, a subsidiary of CBAK New Energy, where CBAK New Energy owns 67.33% of registered equity interests (representing 69.12% of paid-up\ncapital as of March 31, 2024).\n47\nAs disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed on March 15, 2024 and other reports filed with the\nSEC, we started construction of our Nanjing facilities to expand our lithium battery manufacturing capabilities in 2020. The project comprises two phases.\nPhase I, encompassing an area of approximately 27,173 square meters, was put into operation in the second half of 2021. Since then, we have been steadily\nincreasing Phase I’s production capacity, which currently stands at 2 GWh. Construction of the Phase II began in 2022 and includes three major\nmanufacturing plants. The construction of the ceiling stage for the first of these three plants in Phase II was completed in 2023, and we anticipate it will\ncommence operations in 2025. Once fully operational, the Nanjing facilities are projected to provide a total capacity of 20 GWh to support our customers’\ngrowing demand. In 2023, our client demand for batteries soared, prompting us to rent additional manufacturing space in Shangqiu, Henan, PRC. Our\nShangqiu facility has a capacity of 0.5 GWh per year. We have two production lines at this leased facility, and the renovation costs were covered by the\nowner. Additionally, subject to meeting certain criteria, the rental expenses can be offset by the taxes incurred. We have been expanding our business by\ndeveloping new products, fostering new partnerships and strategic acquisition of companies that complement and augment our business.\nThe clean energy industry is of strategic importance in China and many other countries. With the global emphasis on the new energy industry, we anticipate\nsecuring more potential orders from our clients. The Chinese government has been providing support for the development of new energy facilities and\nvehicles for several years. Considering our major operations are in China, the policy support to the new energy industry is crucial to our business. With the\ngrowing demand for high-power lithium-ion and sodium-ion products, we are optimistic about our future prospects.\nFinancial Performance Highlights for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2024\nThe following are some financial highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2024:\n● Net revenues: Net revenues increased by $16.4 million, or 39%, to $58.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, from $42.4 million\nfor the same period in 2023.\n● Gross profit: Gross profit was $18.8 million, representing an increase of $15.9 million, or 546% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, from\ngross profit of $2.9 million for the same period in 2023.\n● Operating income (loss): Operating income was $10.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, reflecting an increase of $13.1 million\nfrom an operating loss of $2.9 million for the same period in 2023.\n● Net income (loss): Net income was $9.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to a net loss of $2.2 million for the same\nperiod in 2023.\n● Fully diluted income per share: Fully diluted income per share was $0.11 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to fully\ndiluted loss per share of $0.02 for the same period in 2023.\nFinancial Statement Presentation\nNet revenues.

The market for batteries used in electric vehicles has become highly competitive from 2023,\nwith key players consistently reducing sales prices. Consequently, we have scaled back our marketing efforts in this sector and plan to reassess our strategy\nonce the price level recovers.\nNet revenues from sales of batteries for light electric vehicles were $1.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to $2.0 million in\nthe same period of 2023, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 23%. Similarly, the domestic market for batteries used in light electric vehicles has become\nextremely competitive. We have reduced our marketing efforts in the Chinese market and instead begun seeking collaboration with light electric vehicle\nmanufacturers in international markets, including India. We believe that our sales campaign in the international market will contribute to a rebound in our\nsales volume in this sector in the near future.\nNet revenues from sales of batteries for residential energy supply & uninterruptable power supplies were $42.8 million in the three months ended March\n31, 2024, as compared with $25.8 million in the same period in 2023, representing an increase of $17.0 million, or 66%. The increase in sales of batteries\nfor residential energy supply & uninterruptable supplies in the first quarter of 2024 can be attributed to a combination of factors including growing demand\nfor renewable energy sources, and our development of reliable and low-cost products. As more businesses and households switch to renewable energy,\nthere has been a growing demand for renewable energy sources and the need for energy storage solutions to support these sources. Additionally, our focus\non research and development has allowed us to develop innovative and reliable energy storage products at competitive pricing.\nNet revenues from sales of materials used in manufacturing of lithium batteries were $14.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as\ncompared to $12.8 million for the same period of 2023, representing an increase of $1.2 million, or 9%.\n51\nCost of revenues.

As a percentage of revenues,\nsales and marketing expenses were 3% and 2% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase mainly resulted from a\n$0.8 million increase in promotion expenses. We have expanded our marketing effort for overseas markets.\nGeneral and administrative expenses.

For\nthe three months ended March 31, 2023, we received government assistance of $0.1 million and generated $0.1 million of services income for technical\ndevelopment of lithium battery.\nChanges in fair value of warrants liability. We issued warrants in the financing we consummated in December 2020 and February 2022. We determined\nthat these warrants should be accounted for as derivative liabilities, as the warrants are dominated in a currency (U.S. dollar) other than our functional\ncurrency. The change in fair value of warrants liability is mainly due to the share price decline.\nIncome tax. Income tax expenses was $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to a tax credit of $0.4 million for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023.

As of March 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $36.3\nmillion. Our total current assets were $130.1 million and our total current liabilities were $156.1 million as of March 31, 2024, resulting in a net working\ncapital deficit of $26.0 million.\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $124.6 million. We had an accumulated deficit from net losses incurred from prior years and\nsignificant short-term debt obligations maturing in less than one year as of March 31, 2024. These factors raise substantial doubts about our ability to\ncontinue as a going concern. The report from our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2023 included an\nexplanatory paragraph in respect of the substantial doubt of our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThese condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nLending from Financial Institutions\nOn November 16, 2021, we obtained banking facilities from Shaoxing Branch of Bank of Communications Co., Ltd with a maximum amount of\nRMB120.1 million (approximately $16.6 million) with the term from November 18, 2021 to November 18, 2026.

We early repaid the loan principal and related loan interests on December 22, 2023.\nOn July 31, 2023, we obtained a three-year term facility from Bank of China Gaochun Branch, with a maximum amount of RMB10 million (approximately\n$1.4 million) with the term from July 31, 2023 to July 30, 2026.

We plan to renew these loans upon maturity and intend to raise\nadditional funds through bank borrowings in the future to meet our daily cash demands, if required.\nEquity and Debt Financings from Investors\nWe have also obtained funds through private placements, registered direct offerings and other equity and note financings.\nOn December 8, 2020, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional investors, pursuant to which we issued in a registered\ndirect offering, an aggregate of 9,489,800 shares of common stock of the Company at a per share purchase price of $5.18, and warrants to purchase an\naggregate of 3,795,920 shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $6.46 per share exercisable for 36 months from the date of issuance\n(collectively, the “2020 Warrants”), for gross proceeds of approximately $49.16 million, before deducting fees to the placement agent and other offering\nexpenses payable by the Company.\nOn February 8, 2021, we entered into another securities purchase agreement with the same investors, pursuant to which we issued in a registered direct\noffering, an aggregate of 8,939,976 shares of common stock of the Company at a per share purchase price of $7.83.

Series B warrants, along with Series A-2\nwarrants, had both expired on September 1, 2021.

We may also require additional cash due to changing business conditions or other future developments, including any investments\nor acquisitions we may decide to pursue. We plan to renew our bank loans upon maturity, if required, and plan to raise additional funds through bank\nborrowings and equity financing in the future to meet our daily cash demands, if required. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in\nobtaining such financing. If our existing cash and bank borrowing are insufficient to meet our requirements, we may seek to sell equity securities, debt\nsecurities or borrow from lending institutions. We can make no assurance that financing will be available in the amounts we need or on terms acceptable to\nus, if at all. The sale of equity securities, including convertible debt securities, would dilute the interests of our current shareholders. The incurrence of debt\nwould divert cash for working capital and capital expenditures to service debt obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that restrict\nour operations and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. If we are unable to obtain additional equity or debt financing as required, our business\noperations and prospects may suffer.\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue to operate as a going concern, which\ncontemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. The condensed consolidated financial statements do\nnot include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of\nliabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty related to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\n(All amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2023 2024\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 9,521 $ 7,447\nNet cash used in investing activities (7,217) (12,836)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities 3,192 (16,392)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 285 (785)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 5,781 (22,566)\nCash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at the beginning of period 37,356 58,823\nCash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at the end of period $ 43,137 $ 36,257\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $7.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared with $9.5 million in the same period in\n2023.

Such funds will be mainly used to construct new\nplants with new product lines and battery module packing lines.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial information has been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and\nassumptions that affect (1) the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, (2) the disclosure of our contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each\nfiscal period and (3) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each fiscal period. We continually evaluate these estimates based on our own\nhistorical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions, our expectations regarding the future based on available\ninformation and reasonable assumptions, which together form our basis for making judgments about matters that are not readily apparent from other\nsources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, our actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of\nour accounting policies require a higher degree of judgment than others in their application.\nThere were no material changes to the critical accounting policies previously disclosed in our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 15, 2024.\nChanges in Accounting Standards\nPlease refer to Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, “Principal Activities, Basis of Presentation and Organization—Recently Adopted\nAccounting Standards” and “—Recently Issued But Not Yet Adopted Accounting Pronouncements” for a discussion of relevant pronouncements.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nNot applicable.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management has carried out an evaluation, with the participation and under the supervision of our\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March\n31, 2024. Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the\nreports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms\nof the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures,\nmanagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving\nthe desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures.\n59\nManagement conducted its evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial\nOfficer. Based upon, and as of the date of this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls\nand procedures were ineffective as of March 31, 2024.\nAs we disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024, during our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control\nover financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting:\n● We did not have appropriate policies and procedures in place to evaluate the proper accounting and disclosures of key documents and agreements.\n● We do not have sufficient and skilled accounting personnel with an appropriate level of technical accounting knowledge and experience in the\napplication of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States commensurate with our financial reporting requirements.\nIn order to cure the foregoing material weaknesses, we have taken or are taking the following remediation measures:\n● We are in the process of hiring a permanent chief financial officer with significant U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience. Ms. Xiangyu Pei\nwas appointed by the Board of Directors of the Company as the Interim Chief Financial Officer on August 23, 2019. Ms. Xiangyu Pei resigned as\nour Interim Chief Financial Officer on August 22, 2023 but has continued to serve in the Company’s finance department and on the board of\ndirector. Mr. Jiewei Li was appointed as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer on August 22, 2023.\n● We have regularly offered our financial personnel trainings on internal control and risk management. We have regularly provided trainings to our\nfinancial personnel on U.S. GAAP accounting guidelines. We plan to continue to provide trainings to our financial team and our other relevant\npersonnel on the U.S. GAAP accounting guidelines applicable to our financial reporting requirements.\nWe intend to complete the remediation of the material weaknesses discussed above as soon as practicable but we can give no assurance that we will be able\nto do so. Designing and implementing an effective disclosure controls and procedures is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to\nchanges in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to devote significant resources to maintain a financial reporting system that\nadequately satisfies our reporting obligations. The remedial measures that we have taken and intend to take may not fully address the material weaknesses\nthat we have identified.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nExcept for the matters described above, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2024\nthat have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n60\nPART II\nOTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1.

(NASDAQ: CBAT) (\"CBAK Energy,\" or the \"Company\") a leading lithium-ion battery manufacturer and electric energy solution provider in China, today reported its unaudited financial results for the third quarter 2024 ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**First****nine****months****of 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Net revenues from sales of batteries** were $113.9 million, an increase of 18.4% from $96.2 million in the same period of 2023.\n    * **Net revenues from batteries used in light electric vehicles** were $8.2 million, an increase of 95% from $4.2 million in the same period of 2023.\n    * **Net revenues from batteries used in electric vehicles** were $1.0 million, a decrease of 57.1% from $2.4 million in the same period of 2023.\n    * **Net revenues from residential energy supply & uninterruptible supplies** were $104.6 million, an increase of 16.8% from $89.5 million in the same period of 2023.\n  * **Gross margin for the battery business** was 34.3%, an increase of 15.2 percentage points from 19.1% in the same period of 2023.\n  * **Net income from the battery business** was $21.6 million, an increase of 222% from $6.7 million in the same period of 2023.\n\n\n\nZhiguang Hu, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented, \"We are pleased to report a remarkable 18.4% increase in battery sales revenue during the first nine months of the year, especially given the intense competition within the industry. Our battery business has also delivered an impressive gross margin of 34.6% for the same period, positioning us well ahead of all competitors in the battery manufacturing sector, including internationally recognized industry leaders. Despite broader economic challenges, we have successfully achieved a net income of $21.6 million from our battery operations for the first three quarters of the year. We are proud to present this exceptional performance to our shareholders and investors and remain highly confident in our continued growth for the following quarters in this and next years.\"\n\nJiewei Li, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of the Board of the Company, added, \"As Mr. Hu highlighted, our financial performance for the first three quarters has been exceptionally strong, setting a new benchmark within the industry. While our Dalian facility has continued to generate consistent profits, we are particularly pleased to report that our Nanjing facility—just operating for less than three years with a new battery model—has become profitable as of Q3. The demand and order volumes at the Nanjing plant have far surpassed its current capacity, leading to full-day operations across all production lines. In response to this robust client demand, we have secured procurement agreements with our equipment suppliers and are set to expand the production at our Nanjing Phase II project, adding an additional 2.5 to 3 GWh of capacity by next year.\"\n\n**Third Quarter of 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Net revenues**[1] were $44.6 million, representing a decrease of 29.7% compared to $63.4 million in the same period of 2023. This decrease in revenues was due to the fact that the Dalian factory had been operating at full capacity since the beginning of the year, which resulted in a one-month suspension for maintenance in the third quarter. In addition to that, Hitrans is facing suboptimal business performance.\n\nAmong these revenues, detailed revenues from our battery business are:\n\n**Battery Business** | **2023** **Third** **Quarter** | **2024****Third** **Quarter** | **% ChangeYoY**  \n---|---|---|---  \nNet Revenues ($) | 44,327,653 | 33,461,793 | (25)  \nGross Profits ($) | 11,698,226 | 7,665,009 | (31)  \nGross Margin | 26.4 | % | 22.9 | % | -  \nNet Income ($) | 7,770,711 | 2,035,338 | -  \n**Net Revenues from Battery Business on Applications ($)**  \nElectric Vehicles | 402,863 | 333,216 | (17)  \nLight Electric Vehicles | 1,114,107 | 4,913,644 | 341  \nResidential Energy Supply & Uninterruptable supplies | 42,810,683 | 28,214,934 | (34)  \nTotal | 63,441,109 | 44,628,241 | (30)  \n  \n[1] Net revenues consist of the Company's self-operated battery business and Hitrans, which was acquired in 2021, an independently managed raw materials business.  \n---  \n  \n**Cost of revenues** was $37.7 million, representing a decrease of 26.4% from $51.2 million in the same period of 2023.
