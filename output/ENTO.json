(Nasdaq: ENTO) (“Entero” or the “Company”), today announced that it has entered into a binding term sheet for a reverse merger transaction (the “Proposed Merger”) with Journey Therapeutics, Inc. (“Journey”), a privately-held, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a next-generation proprietary modular antibody-drug conjugate (ADC)-like, nano-immunoconjugates (NIC) platform. Upon completion of the Proposed Merger, the shareholders of Journey will acquire 99% of the equity of Entero. The combined company is expected to operate under the name Journey Therapeutics, Inc., and will apply for continued trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The completion of the Proposed Merger is subject to several conditions, including the negotiation of definitive agreements, the receipt by Entero of at least $5 million of equity financing, the effectiveness of a registration statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the approval of the stockholders of Entero.\n\nFollowing the completion of the Proposed Merger, the new entity would be under the leadership of Henry Ji, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Journey Therapeutics. It is contemplated that the combined company will prioritize advancing Journey’s first-in-class, next-gen NIC product candidates targeting gynecological cancers, advanced non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and other difficult to treat cancers, alongside Entero’s existing clinical assets. These existing assets include a latiglutenase, a pioneering oral biotherapeutic for celiac disease, adrulipase, a recombinant lipase enzyme for cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis, and capeserod, a selective 5HT-4 receptor partial agonist, all of which would continue undergoing clinical development.\n\n“The Proposed Merger with Journey Therapeutics presents an exceptional opportunity for Entero, bringing groundbreaking NIC technology and invaluable expertise under the leadership of Dr. Henry Ji,” said James Sapirstein, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Entero Therapeutics. “Journey’s innovative, first-in-class therapies hold tremendous potential and, after the proposed merger is completed, we are excited to accelerate the key steps to initiate critical clinical trials. This transaction would position us to make significant strides in the oncology sector, tapping into a multibillion-dollar global market and advancing potentially life-changing therapies for patients.”\n\n“Journey looks forward to this proposed merger with Entero Therapeutics, as it allows us to build a publicly traded company that is driven toward advancing Journey’s first-in-class, next-gen nano-immunoconjugates portfolio to rival the advanced antibody-drug conjugates products,” stated Henry Ji, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Journey Therapeutics. “This opportunity arises at a momentous stage in Journey’s development, as we prepare for clinical trials of our two leading assets with encouraging initial clinical results.”\n\nJourney is a clinical-stage, biopharmaceutical company pioneering advanced cancer therapies that leverage nanotechnology and immunotherapy. Rivalling antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), its NIC platform is designed to target tumors precisely, delivering therapeutic agents directly to cancer cells with minimal impact on surrounding healthy tissue. By combining nanotechnology with immunoconjugates, Journey has developed technology that permits modular antibody-based targeting and tailored chemotherapeutic selection, potentially leading to more effective and less toxic treatment of a variety of cancer types. This innovative approach holds tremendous promise for the future of precision oncology. As described by the inventor, Svetomir N. Markovic, M.D., Ph.D. (Mayo Clinic), the NIC platform seeks to usher the next generation of antibody-drug complex therapeutics to enable simultaneous multi-drug delivery to multiple cancer targets. Early, Phase 1 clinical data with two prototype NICs engineered to treat end-stage metastatic ovarian/endometrial cancer (targeting VEGF) or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (targeting CD20) have shown highly encouraging results in clinical efficacy and safety.\n\nFor more information about Entero Therapeutics, visit [www.enterothera.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=6vwj-h4TAEfG70co_jLl_yXp7xkP2oSXKh9gsVtRJkfV2DdsZZOtnLs_wTiM78gsOSPoPQC3xkVaeHvnmtD7_7AhQDTO6WF9u3lGZNyWUnk= \"www.enterothera.com\") and connect on [X](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=neah-M7lmm5BjVNjQPaX2M-Bwl3Zt8kfRDw9mc3wDB2b44bXt-kp7epTLxrcrknZqbi_LhREeXvoccnQtDh89Q== \"X\") and [LinkedIn](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fTpIo42x4RZXprgaioXL-VoNWKzH3FVcFcz3T8ntyS_-SdGaa2fxTKRiBK-5C6HW54bkWXSzQxlsMR6fF_YkrkkcBnywjNRNtUehgPzdHPqvAsMOc9RT72FyFtHhkCRb \"LinkedIn\").\n\nMayo Clinic has a financial interest in the technology referenced in this press release.

(“Data Vault”), a privately held technology holding company, to exclusively license two technology product suites owned by Data Vault -- QOLPOM _®_ and FotoDigm _®_ (the “Proposed Transaction”). Entero Therapeutics will work with Data Vault before and after the closing of the Proposed Transaction to secure funding for the customization of this clinical trial compliance software that includes a focus on the use of DigitalTwins and high-performance computing. In parallel, Entero Therapeutics plans to develop applications for its own near-term use with gastrointestinal (GI) clinical trials beginning with the planned Phase 3 trial for latiglutenase for the treatment of celiac disease.\n\nUnder the terms of the Letter of Intent, Entero Therapeutics, upon execution of a definitive agreement, would receive an exclusive, global license to pilot the technology platform in Entero Therapeutics’ clinical trials, and to develop and commercialize Data Vault’s QOLPOM® and FotoDigm® patented pharmaceutical regime compliance software for use in clinical trials with third-parties in the pharma and biotech sectors. In consideration, Entero Therapeutics will issue to Data Vault shares of the Company’s convertible preferred stock priced at a premium to the market and single digit revenue sharing royalties on net sales. The Proposed Transaction is expected to close by the end of September, and the entry into definitive documentation will be conditioned upon fulfillment requirements of no less than $500K of strategic investment into Entero Therapeutics (the “Strategic Investment”), with a target of ultimately securing up to $3 million of further strategic investment with Data Vault’s assistance. The terms of the Proposed Transaction provide for Data Vault to support the Company’s pursuit of the Strategic Investment. The Strategic Investment would provide Entero Therapeutics with access to both capital and technology for a pilot program and the initiation and potential improvement of the Company’s future clinical trials.\n\nJames Sapirstein, Chairman and CEO of Entero Therapeutics, added, “We are very pleased to have the opportunity to secure an exclusive, worldwide license from Data Vault for its clinical trial compliance technology platform. Compliance is a major issue in drug development – it directly impacts the time, cost and success of clinical trials. We believe that the software platform has the potential to improve outcomes for our Phase 3 latiglutenase trial in celiac disease, along with the other GI therapeutic indications that we are planning to pursue. Both companies are committed to working together to customize the software for the latiglutenase trial. Our clinical trials would be the testing ground for these products and we believe that if they are validated in the clinic, they will have much broader commercial applications for other pharma companies across multiple disease indications.”\n\nMr. Sapirstein added, “We are very impressed with the potential of Data Vault’s IP portfolio – some of which has been historically validated across multiple sectors and most recently in the Data Vault-WisA Technologies transaction, where other Data Vault IP not included in the Proposed Transaction was acquired. FotoDigm IP that was recently issued has a broad scope and has been cited by major IT and healthcare players as references. We are confident that the two assets have the potential to advance the state of the art in clinical trial monitoring and compliance and could create a commercial opportunity with pharma and biotech companies in the industry.”\n\nThe Company’s use of the compliance platform would enable Entero Therapeutics to demonstrate the potential effectiveness and commercial scalability for incorporation in new software applications for a wide range of clinical-trial compliance across multiple therapeutic indications. Under the terms of the Letter of Intent, Entero Therapeutics would assume responsibility for all future clinical trial and commercial development in this sector and would be exclusively authorized to out-license to third parties within. The potential licensing agreement would include an activation triggered upon a capital infusion through strategic investment in Entero Therapeutics, and access to capital, technology and out-licensing within the biopharmaceutical field. The solution has been designed to assist with Entero Therapeutics’ completion of its medical trials in the present and future. The Letter of Intent also provides for a right of first refusal for Entero Therapeutics to fully-acquire the QOLPOM _®_ and FotoDigm _®_ assets from Data Vault Holdings, subject to certain conditions as set forth in the Letter of Intent.\n\nQOLPOM® and FotoDigm® were developed by the late and Honorable Arizona State Senator David Bradley, a behavioral healthcare administrator and the father of Data Vault Holdings’ Chief Executive Officer. QOLPOM® (Quality of Life and Peace of Mind) was developed to solve critical behavioral problems within the remote patient monitoring space leveraging machine learning and IoT sensory capabilities. FotoDigm® is a patented machine vision technology (U.S. patent number 11,437,139 Method and Apparatus for Biometric Data Collection Combing Visual Data with Historical Health Records Metadata) and has been cited by AT&T, Medtronic, Indiana University and Express Scripts amongst others. A second patent (U.S. patent number 12,040,088 issued on Jul 16, 2024) includes foundational and expanded claims and a platform designed to reduce the costs and streamline processes of data collection, verification on a highly scalable and replicable technology for clinical trial data management.\n\nThe terms of the Proposed Transaction are subject to a number of contingencies, including the completion of customary due diligence and the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements. Upon execution of the definitive agreement, the completion of the transaction will be subject to, among other pre-closing requirements, satisfaction of the conditions negotiated therein, receipt of the Strategic Investment on terms satisfactory to Entero Therapeutics, and receipt of all third-party (including governmental) approvals, licenses, consents, and clearances, as and when applicable. There can be no assurance that the Proposed Transaction will be completed on the terms contemplated in the Letter of Intent or otherwise.\n\n**About Entero Therapeutics, Inc.** Entero Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of targeted, non-systemic therapies for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. The Company currently has a therapeutic development pipeline with multiple late-stage clinical programs built around three proprietary technologies: latiglutenase, a Phase 3-ready, potentially first-in-class, targeted, oral biotherapeutic for celiac disease; capeserod, a selective 5-HT4 receptor partial agonist being developed for gastroparesis; and adrulipase, a recombinant lipase enzyme designed to enable the digestion of fats and other nutrients in cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.
