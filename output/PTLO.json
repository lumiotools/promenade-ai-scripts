Announces Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nNovember 5, 2024 \n\n[PDF Version](/node/9186/pdf)\n\nCHICAGO, Nov. 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Portillo’s Inc. (“Portillo’s” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: PTLO), the restaurant concept known for its menu of Chicago-style favorites, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 29, 2024.\n\nMichael Osanloo, President and Chief Executive Officer of Portillo’s, said, “While our top line results for the quarter fell short of expectations, I’m proud of how our team protected margins and drove cash flow. We’re profitable, we’re controlling the levers we can, and we’re positioned for lasting, long-term growth.”\n\n**Financial Highlights for the Third Quarter** **2024 vs. Third Quarter 2023:**\n\n  * Total revenue increased 6.9% or $11.4 million to $178.3 million;\n  * Same-restaurant sales* decreased 0.9%;\n  * Operating income increased $0.9 million to $16.0 million;\n  * Net income increased $2.2 million to $8.8 million;\n  * Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA** increased $0.1 million to $41.9 million; and\n  * Adjusted EBITDA** increased $0.6 million to $27.9 million.\n\n\n\n**_*_**_For the quarter ended September 29, 2024, same-restaurant sales compares the 13 weeks from July 1, 2024 through September 29, 2024 to the 13 weeks from July 3, 2023 through October 1, 2023.__**Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. Please see definitions and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures accompanying this release._\n\n**Recent Developments and Trends**\n\nIn the quarter ended September 29, 2024, total revenue grew 6.9% or $11.4 million primarily due to new restaurant openings in 2023 and 2024. Same-restaurant sales declined 0.9% during the quarter ended September 29, 2024, compared to 3.9% same-restaurant sales growth during the same quarter in 2023. Change in same-restaurant sales is defined below.\n\nIn the quarter ended September 29, 2024, commodity inflation was 3.6% compared to 3.5% for the quarter ended September 24, 2023. Labor, as a percentage of revenue, net increased 0.3% during the quarter ended September 29, 2024 compared to the quarter ended September 24, 2023, primarily due to lower transactions and incremental wage rate increases, partially offset by an increase in our average check.\n\nIn the quarter ended September 29, 2024, total revenue, operating income, net income, Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA all improved versus the prior year. We believe this improvement stemmed from maintaining concentration on our four strategic pillars, which guide our short-term objectives and form the basis for long-term growth.\n\n**Review of Third Quarter** **2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenues for the quarter ended September 29, 2024 were $178.3 million compared to $166.8 million for the quarter ended September 24, 2023, an increase of $11.4 million or 6.9%. The increase in revenues was primarily attributed to the opening of eight restaurants in the third and fourth quarters of 2023 and four restaurants during the three quarters ended September 29, 2024, partially offset by a decrease in our same-restaurant sales. Restaurants not in our Comparable Restaurant Base (defined below) contributed $13.6 million of the total year-over-year increase. This increase in revenues was offset by a same-restaurant sales decrease of 0.9%, or $1.4 million in the quarter. The same-restaurant sales decline was attributable to a 3.5% decrease in transactions, partially offset by an increase in average check of 2.6%. The higher average check was driven by an approximate 4.4% increase in certain menu prices partially offset by product mix. To address inflationary cost pressures, we increased select menu prices by approximately 1.5% in January 2024 and again at the end of March 2024. In June 2024, we implemented a 1% price increase primarily by re-tiering some of our restaurants in higher-cost areas. Revenue was also negatively impacted by $1.0 million in the third quarter due to the shifting of comparable weeks. For the purpose of calculating same-restaurant sales for the quarter ended September 29, 2024, sales for 70 restaurants that were open for at least 24 full fiscal periods were included in the Comparable Restaurant Base.\n\nTotal restaurant operating expenses for the third quarter ended September 29, 2024 were $136.3 million compared to $124.9 million for the third quarter ended September 24, 2023, an increase of $11.4 million or 9.1%. The increase in restaurant operating expenses was primarily driven by the opening of eight restaurants in the third and fourth quarters of 2023 and four restaurants during the three quarters ended September 29, 2024. Additionally, food, beverage and packaging costs were negatively impacted by a 3.6% increase in commodity prices. Labor expense increases were also driven by incremental investments to support our team members, partially offset by lower variable-based compensation. Lastly, the increase in other operating expenses was due to the aforementioned restaurant openings and increases in repairs and maintenance, partially offset by a decrease in insurance expense.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the third quarter ended September 29, 2024 were $18.3 million compared to $18.9 million for the third quarter ended September 24, 2023, a decrease of $0.6 million or 3.1%. This decrease was primarily driven by lower variable-based and equity compensation, partially offset by an increase in advertising expenses and software license expense related to our enterprise resource planning system (\"ERP\") implementation.\n\nOperating income for the third quarter ended September 29, 2024 was $16.0 million compared to $15.1 million for the third quarter ended September 24, 2023, an increase of $0.9 million due to an increase in revenues and decrease in general and administrative expenses and pre-opening expenses, partially offset by increases in total restaurant operating expenses, and depreciation and amortization.\n\nNet income for the third quarter ended September 29, 2024 was $8.8 million compared to a net income of $6.5 million for the third quarter ended September 24, 2023, an increase of $2.2 million. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in our Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment of $1.2 million and an increase in operating income of $0.9 million due to the aforementioned factors.\n\nRestaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA* for the third quarter ended September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023 was $41.9 million.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA* for the third quarter ended September 29, 2024 was $27.9 million compared to $27.3 million for the quarter ended September 24, 2023, an increase of $0.6 million or 2.3%.\n\n_*A reconciliation of Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and the nearest GAAP financial measure is included under “Non-GAAP Measures” in the accompanying financial data below._\n\n**Development Highlights**\n\nDuring the three quarters ended September 29, 2024, we opened four new restaurants. Subsequent to September 29, 2024, we opened one additional restaurant, bringing our total restaurant count to 89, including a restaurant owned by C&O of which Portillo’s owns 50% of the equity. We plan to open five more restaurants, all in December, for a total of 10 new restaurants opened in the fiscal year 2024, including further expansion into the Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth markets in Texas.\n\nBelow are the restaurants opened since the beginning of fiscal 2024:\n\n**Location**| **Opening Month**| **Fiscal Quarter Opened**  \n---|---|---  \nDenton, Texas| March 2024| Q1 2024  \nSurprise, Arizona| May 2024| Q2 2024  \nLivonia, Michigan| July 2024| Q3 2024  \nMansfield, Texas| August 2024| Q3 2024  \nRichmond, Texas| October 2024| Q4 2024  \n  \n**Fiscal 2024 Financial Targets**\n\nBased on current expectations, we are providing updated financial targets for 2024 as follows:\n\n**Prior Target**| **Current Target**  \n---|---  \nUnit growth| 10+ new units| →| 10 new units  \nSame-restaurant sales| Flat to slightly positive| →| Approximately (1.0%)  \nCommodity inflation| mid-single digits| →| mid-single digits  \nLabor inflation| mid-single digits| →| Approximately 3.0%  \nRestaurant-level adjusted EBITDA margin*| 23% - 24%| →| 23% - 24%  \nGeneral and administrative expenses| $82 - $84 million| →| $78 - $80 million  \nPre-opening expenses| $10.0 - $10.5 million| →| $10.0 - $10.5 million  \nCapital expenditures| $85 - $88 million| →| $85 - $88 million  \n  \n*We are unable to reconcile the long-term outlook for restaurant-level adjusted EBITDA margin to operating income/loss margin, the corresponding U.S. GAAP measure, due to variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections and because not all information necessary to prepare the reconciliation is available to us without unreasonable efforts. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information because we cannot accurately predict all of the components of the adjusted calculations and the non-GAAP measure may be materially different than the GAAP measure.\n\n**Long-Term Financial Targets**\n\nUnit growth| 12% - 15%  \n---|---  \nSame-restaurant sales| Low single digits  \nRevenue growth| Mid teens  \nAdjusted EBITDA growth*| Low teens  \n  \n*We are unable to reconcile the long-term outlook for adjusted EBITDA growth to net income/loss, the corresponding U.S. GAAP measure, due to variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections and because not all information necessary to prepare the reconciliation is available to us without unreasonable efforts. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information because we cannot accurately predict all of the components of the adjusted calculations and the non-GAAP measure may be materially different than the GAAP measure.\n\n**The following definitions apply to these terms as used in this release:**\n\n**Change in Same-Restaurant Sales -** The change in same-restaurant sales is the percentage change in year-over-year revenue (excluding gift card breakage) for the Comparable Restaurant Base, which is defined as the number of restaurants open for at least 24 full fiscal periods. For the quarters ended September 29, 2024 and September 24, 2023, there were 70 and 66 restaurants in our Comparable Restaurant Base, respectively.\n\nA change in same-restaurant sales is the result of a change in restaurant transactions, average guest check, or a combination of the two. We gather daily sales data and regularly analyze the guest transaction counts and the mix of menu items sold to strategically evaluate menu pricing and demand. Measuring our change in same-restaurant sales allows management to evaluate the performance of our existing restaurant base. We believe this measure provides a consistent comparison of restaurant sales results and trends across periods within our core, established restaurant base, unaffected by results of restaurant openings and enables investors to better understand and evaluate the Company’s historical and prospective operating performance.\n\n**Average Unit Volume -** AUV is the total revenue (excluding gift card breakage) recognized in the Comparable Restaurant Base, including C&O, divided by the number of restaurants in the Comparable Restaurant Base, including C&O, by period.\n\nThis key performance indicator allows management to assess changes in consumer spending patterns at our restaurants and the overall performance of our restaurant base.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin -** Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income, and income taxes, adjusted for the impact of certain non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing core operating performance as identified in the reconciliation of net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues, net. See also “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n\n**Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA Margin -** Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenue, less restaurant operating expenses, which include food, beverage and packaging costs, labor expenses, occupancy expenses and other operating expenses. Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA excludes corporate level expenses and depreciation and amortization on restaurant property and equipment. Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues, net. See also “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”.\n\nFor more information about the Company’s Non-GAAP measures, how they are calculated and reconciled and why management believes that they are useful, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\n\n**Earnings Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its financial results for the third quarter ended September 29, 2024 on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, at 10:00 AM ET. The conference call can be accessed live over the phone by dialing 877-407-3982.

For the three quarters ended September 29, 2024, same-restaurant sales compares the 39 weeks from January 1, 2024 through September 29, 2024 to the 39 weeks from January 2, 2023 through October 1, 2023.\n\n**PORTILLO’S INC.****NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**\n\nTo supplement the consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Accordingly, Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP, but rather are supplemental measures of operating performance of our restaurants. You should be aware that these measures are not indicative of overall results for the Company and that Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not accrue directly to the benefit of stockholders because of corporate-level expenses excluded from such measures. These measures are supplemental measures of operating performance and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. These measures are important measures to evaluate the performance and profitability of our restaurants, individually and in the aggregate, but also have important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income, and income taxes, adjusted for the impact of certain non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing core operating performance as identified in the reconciliation of net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues.\n\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin (i) to evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of our business strategies, (ii) internally as benchmarks to compare our performance to that of our competitors and (iii) as factors in evaluating management’s performance when determining incentive compensation.\n\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are important measures of operating performance because they eliminate the impact of expenses that do not relate to our core operating performance.\n\nWe are unable to reconcile the long-term outlook for Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the corresponding U.S. GAAP measure, due to variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections and because not all information necessary to prepare the reconciliation is available to us without unreasonable efforts. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information because we cannot accurately predict all of the components of the adjusted calculations and the non-GAAP measure may be materially different than the GAAP measure.\n\n**Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA Margin**\n\nRestaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenue, less restaurant operating expenses, which include cost of goods sold (excluding depreciation and amortization), labor expenses, occupancy expenses and other operating expenses. Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA excludes corporate level expenses and depreciation and amortization on restaurant property and equipment. Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.\n\nWe believe that Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA Margin are important measures to evaluate the performance and profitability of our restaurants, individually and in the aggregate.\n\nSee below for a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin (in thousands):\n\n**Quarter Ended**| **Three Quarters Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 29, 2024**| **September 24, 2023**| **September 29, 2024**| **September 24, 2023**  \nNet income| $| 8,773| $| 6,546| $| 22,647| $| 15,171  \n _Net income margin_|  _4.9_|  _%_| _3.9_|  _%_| _4.3_|  _%_| _3.1_|  _%_  \nDepreciation and amortization| 6,679| 6,178| 20,729| 17,788  \nInterest expense| 6,450| 6,573| 19,583| 20,539  \nInterest income| (50| )| (116| )| (204| )| (116| )  \nLoss on debt extinguishment| —| —| —| 3,465  \nIncome tax expense| 2,539| 2,622| 4,898| 3,605  \nEBITDA| 24,391| 21,803| 67,653| 60,452  \nDeferred rent (1)| 1,391| 1,388| 3,857| 3,781  \nEquity-based compensation| 3,506| 4,324| 9,223| 12,044  \nCloud-based software implementation costs (2)| 64| 149| 514| 149  \nAmortization of cloud-based software implementation costs (3)| 220| —| 366| —  \nOther loss (4)| 63| 16| 129| 511  \nTransaction-related fees and expenses (5)| —| 133| 536| 894  \nTax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment (6)| (1,724| )| (528| )| (2,724| )| (1,691| )  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 27,911| $| 27,285| $| 79,554| $| 76,140  \n _Adjusted EBITDA Margin (7)_| _15.7_|  _%_| _16.4_|  _%_| _15.1_|  _%_| _15.5_|  _%_  \n  \n(1) Represents the difference between cash rent payments and the recognition of straight-line rent expense recognized over the lease term.
