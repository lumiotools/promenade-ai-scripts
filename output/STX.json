We are excited by the strong product momentum which positions us well to address customer demand while delivering profitable growth. Our confidence in Seagate’s future opportunities is reflected in the decision to raise the quarterly dividend as announced today,\" Mosley concluded. \n\n**Quarterly Financial Results**\n\nGAAP  |  Non-GAAP   \n---|---  \nFQ1 2025  |  FQ1 2024  |  FQ1 2025  |  FQ1 2024   \nRevenue ($M)  |  $  |  2,168  |  $  |  1,454  |  $  |  2,168  |  $  |  1,454   \nGross Margin  |  32.9  |  %  |  10.2  |  %  |  33.3  |  %  |  19.8  |  %   \nOperating Margin  |  18.6  |  %  |  (8.9  |  %)  |  20.4  |  %  |  2.8  |  %   \nNet Income (Loss) ($M)  |  $  |  305  |  $  |  (184  |  )  |  $  |  337  |  $  |  (46  |  )   \nDiluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share  |  $  |  1.41  |  $  |  (0.88  |  )  |  $  |  1.58  |  $  |  (0.22  |  )   \n  \nFor a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results, see accompanying financial tables. \n\nDuring the fiscal first quarter the Company generated $95 million in cash flow from operations, $27 million in free cash flow and returned $147 million of capital to shareholders through its quarterly dividend. As of the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.2 billion, and there were 211 million ordinary shares issued and outstanding. \n\nSeagate has issued a Supplemental Financial Information document, which is available on Seagate’s Investor Relations website at [investors.seagate.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.seagate.com%2Foverview%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=54139817&newsitemid=20241022235947&lan=en-US&anchor=investors.seagate.com&index=1&md5=0ca9989edec287d7cd72a4426aa8d47d). \n\n**Quarterly Cash Dividend**\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.72 per share, which will be payable on January 6, 2025 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 15, 2024. The payment of any future quarterly dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent upon Seagate’s financial position, results of operations, available cash, cash flow, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. \n\n**Business Outlook**\n\nThe business outlook for the fiscal second quarter 2025 is based on our current assumptions and expectations; actual results may differ materially as a result of, among other things, the important factors discussed in the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section of this release. \n\nThe Company is providing the following guidance for its fiscal second quarter 2025: \n\n  * Revenue of $2.30 billion, plus or minus $150 million \n  * Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.85, plus or minus $0.20 \n\n\n\nGuidance regarding non-GAAP diluted EPS excludes known pre-tax charges related to estimated share-based compensation expenses of $0.22 per share. \n\nWe have not reconciled our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance for fiscal second quarter 2025 to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, other than estimated share-based compensation expenses, because material items that may impact these measures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, including, but not limited to, net (gain) loss recognized from early redemption of debt, purchase order cancellation fees, strategic investment losses (gains) or impairment charges, income tax adjustments on these measures, and other charges or benefits that may arise. The amounts of these measures are not currently available but may be material to future results. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance for fiscal second quarter 2025 to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. A reconciliation of our historical non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest GAAP equivalent is contained in this release. \n\n**Investor Communications**\n\nSeagate management will hold a public webcast today at 2:00 PM PT / 5:00 PM ET that can be accessed on its Investor Relations website at [investors.seagate.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.seagate.com%2Foverview%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=54139817&newsitemid=20241022235947&lan=en-US&anchor=investors.seagate.com&index=2&md5=28e06ef86e78add0a8311d6bb040acbb). \n\nAn archived audio webcast of this event will be available on Seagate’s Investor Relations website at [investors.seagate.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.seagate.com%2Foverview%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=54139817&newsitemid=20241022235947&lan=en-US&anchor=investors.seagate.com&index=3&md5=061d53c17c53a562850c3c5ffb287f96) shortly following the event conclusion. \n\n**About Seagate**\n\nSeagate Technology is a leading innovator of mass-capacity data storage.

non-GAAP financial information**\n\nThe Company uses non-GAAP measures of gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses, income from operations, operating margin, net income, diluted EPS, free cash flow, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and last twelve months adjusted EBITDA, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain benefits, expenses, gains and losses. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to evaluate the business and provided to enhance the user’s overall understanding of the Company’s current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Company believes non-GAAP results provide useful information to investors as these non-GAAP results exclude certain benefits, expenses, gains and losses that the Company believes are not part of the Company's ongoing operations and not indicative of its core operating results. \n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are some of the measurements management uses to assess the Company’s performance, allocate resources and plan for future periods. Reported non-GAAP results should only be considered as supplemental to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and not considered as a substitute or replacement for, or superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP measures reported by other companies in its industry. \n\n**SEAGATE TECHNOLOGY HOLDINGS PLC** **RECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES** **(In millions, except per share amounts, gross margin and operating margin)** **(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**For the Three Months Ended**  \n**September 27, 2024** |  **September 29, 2023**  \n**GAAP Gross Profit** |  $  |  714  |  $  |  149   \nAccelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts  |  —  |  13   \nPurchase order cancellation fees  |  (1  |  )  |  118   \nShare-based compensation  |  10  |  7   \nOther charges  |  —  |  1   \n**Non-GAAP Gross Profit** |  $  |  723  |  $  |  288   \n**GAAP Gross Margin** |  32.9  |  %  |  10.2  |  %   \n**Non-GAAP Gross Margin** |  33.3  |  %  |  19.8  |  %   \n**GAAP Operating Expenses** |  $  |  311  |  $  |  278   \nRestructuring and other, net  |  (1  |  )  |  (2  |  )   \nShare-based compensation  |  (28  |  )  |  (18  |  )   \nOther charges  |  (1  |  )  |  (10  |  )   \n**Non-GAAP Operating Expenses** |  $  |  281  |  $  |  248   \n**GAAP Income (Loss) From Operations** |  $  |  403  |  $  |  (129  |  )   \nAccelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts  |  —  |  13   \nPurchase order cancellation fees  |  (1  |  )  |  118   \nRestructuring and other, net  |  1  |  2   \nShare-based compensation  |  38  |  25   \nOther charges  |  1  |  11   \n**Non-GAAP Income From Operations** |  $  |  442  |  $  |  40   \n**GAAP Operating Margin** |  18.6  |  %  |  (8.9  |  )%   \n**Non-GAAP Operating Margin** |  20.4  |  %  |  2.8  |  %   \n**GAAP Net Income (Loss)** |  $  |  305  |  $  |  (184  |  )   \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nAccelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts  |  —  |  13   \nNet gain from termination of interest rate swap  |  —  |  (104  |  )   \nNet loss from early redemption of debt  |  —  |  29   \nPurchase order cancellation fees  |  (1  |  )  |  118   \nRestructuring and other, net  |  1  |  2   \nShare-based compensation  |  38  |  25   \nStrategic investment losses or impairment charges  |  1  |  —   \nOther charges  |  1  |  11   \nIncome tax adjustments  |  (8  |  )  |  44   \n**Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss)** |  $  |  337  |  $  |  (46  |  )   \n**GAAP Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share** |  $  |  1.41  |  $  |  (0.88  |  )   \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nAccelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts  |  —  |  0.06   \nNet gain from termination of interest rate swap  |  —  |  $  |  (0.50  |  )   \nNet loss from early redemption of debt  |  —  |  0.14   \nPurchase order cancellation fees  |  —  |  0.57   \nRestructuring and other, net  |  —  |  0.01   \nShare-based compensation  |  0.18  |  0.12   \nStrategic investment losses or impairment charges  |  —  |  —   \nOther charges  |  —  |  0.05   \nIncome tax adjustments  |  (0.04  |  )  |  0.21   \nNon-GAAP diluted share count adjustments 1 |  0.03  |  —   \n**Non-GAAP Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share 1 ** |  $  |  1.58  |  $  |  (0.22  |  )   \n**Shares Used In Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share Calculation**  \nGAAP  |  216  |  208   \nNon-GAAP diluted share count adjustments 1 |  (3  |  )  |  —   \nNon-GAAP  |  213  |  208   \n**GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities** |  $  |  95  |  $  |  127   \nAcquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements  |  (68  |  )  |  (70  |  )   \n**Free Cash Flow** |  $  |  27  |  $  |  57   \n_____________________________________  \n---  \n1 |  For the three months ended September 27, 2024, using the if-converted method, approximately 3 million shares are issuable upon conversion of our 2028 exchangeable senior notes.

Exclusion of these amounts provides a supplemental view of the Company's operating performance to investors to enable them to evaluate the Company's current operating performance compared to the past periods' operating performance. \n\n**Net gain from business divestiture**\n\nThe Company recorded a pre-tax net gain of $313 million in connection to the sale of System-on-Chip Operations in April 2024. The net gain is excluded in the non-GAAP measures because it is not indicative of the Company's operating performance. The Company excludes this amount to provide a supplemental view to investors to evaluate the Company's current operating performance compared to the past periods' operating performance. \n\n**Net loss (gain) from early redemption of debt and termination of interest rate swap**\n\nFrom time to time, the Company incurs gains, losses and fees from the early redemption and repurchase of certain long-term debt instruments and termination of related interest rate swap agreements. The amount of these charges may be inconsistent in size and varies depending on the timing of the early redemption of debt and/or termination of interest rate swap. The Company does not believe these are part of its normal operating performance. Exclusion of these amounts provides a supplemental view of the Company's operating performance to investors to enable them to evaluate the Company's current operating performance compared to the past periods' operating performance. \n\n**Purchase order cancellation fees**\n\nPurchase order cancellation fees are the costs incurred to cancel certain purchase commitments made with the Company's suppliers for component and equipment purchases that will not be received due to change in forecasted demand. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency. The Company does not believe these are part of its normal operating expenses. Exclusion of these amounts provides a supplemental view to investors to evaluate the Company's current operating performance compared to the past periods’ operating performance. \n\n**Restructuring and other, net**\n\nRestructuring and other, net are costs associated with restructuring plans that are primarily related to costs associated with reduction in the Company’s workforce, exiting certain facilities and other related costs, as well as charges or gains from sale of properties. These costs or benefits do not reflect the Company’s normal or ongoing operating performance and consequently the Company excludes these expenses to provide a supplemental view to investors to evaluate the Company's current operating performance compared to the past periods’ operating performance. \n\n**Share-based compensation**\n\nThese expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee share-based compensation. Given the variety of equity awards used by companies, the varying methodologies for determining share-based compensation expense, the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations, and the volatility in valuations that can be driven by market conditions outside the Company’s control, the Company believes excluding share-based compensation expense enhances the ability of management and investors to understand and assess the underlying performance of its business over time and compare it against the Company’s peers, a majority of whom also exclude share-based compensation expense from their non-GAAP results. \n\n**Strategic investment gains, losses and impairment charges**\n\nFrom time to time, the Company incurs gains, losses or impairment charges from strategic investments that are measured and accounted at fair value, under the equity method of accounting, as available-for-sale debt securities or adjust for downward or upward adjustments to the carrying value under the measurement alternative if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the current period that are not considered normal operating expenses or gains. The resulting expense, gain or impairment loss is inconsistent in amount and frequency and the Company excludes these amounts to provide a supplemental view to investors to evaluate the Company's current operating performance compared to the past periods’ operating performance. \n\n**Other charges**\n\nThe other charges primarily include IT transformation costs. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are excluded to provide a supplemental view to investors to evaluate the Company's current operating performance compared to past periods’ operating performance. \n\n**Income tax adjustments**\n\nProvision or benefit for income taxes represents the tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments determined using a hybrid with and without method and effective tax rate for the applicable adjustment and jurisdiction. \n\n**Non-GAAP diluted share count adjustments**\n\nUsing the if-converted method, diluted net income per share is calculated assuming that the excess value above the principal of the 2028 exchangeable notes were converted solely into shares of common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive. Non-GAAP shares used in diluted net income per share calculation excluded certain dilutive shares, which are expected to be offset partially or in full by the capped call transactions entered by the Company in conjunction with our 2028 exchangeable senior notes in order to reduce the potential dilution to the Company’s ordinary shares upon the conversion. \n\n**Free cash flow**\n\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities less acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements. Free cash flow does not reflect non-cash items, net cash used or provided by financing activities and net cash used or provided by investing activities, other than acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements. This non-GAAP financial measure is used by management to assess the Company's sources of liquidity, capital structure and operating performance. \n\n**EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and last twelve months (LTM) adjusted EBITDA**\n\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before income tax expense, interest expense, interest income, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain expenses, gains and losses that the Company believes are not indicative of its core operating results. These adjustments primarily include impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts, net loss (gain) from early redemption of debt, net gain from termination of interest rate swap, net gain from business divestiture, purchase order cancellation fees, restructuring and other, net, share-based compensation, strategic investment losses or impairment charges, other extraordinary charges such as factory underutilization charges. LTM adjusted EBITDA is defined as the total of last twelve months adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to evaluate the Company’s debt portfolio and structure to comply with its financial debt covenants. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241022235947r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\n_Investor Relations Contact:_ Shanye Hudson, (510) 661-1600 shanye.hudson@seagate.com\n\n_Media Contact:_ Karin Taylor (408) 772-8279 karin.h.taylor@seagate.com\n\nSource: Seagate Technology Holdings plc\n\n**Multimedia Files:**\n\n[ ![Multimedia JPG file for Seagate Technology Reports Fiscal First Quarter 2025 Financial Results](//s24.q4cdn.com/101481333/files/doc_multimedia/2024/10/1008977763/seagate2015_2c_horizontal_pos@thumbnail.png) ](//s24.q4cdn.com/101481333/files/doc_multimedia/2024/10/1008977763/seagate2015_2c_horizontal_pos.jpg)\n\nDownload:\n\n[ Download original 314 KB (4813 x 1225) ](//s24.q4cdn.com/101481333/files/doc_multimedia/2024/10/1008977763/seagate2015_2c_horizontal_pos.jpg)\n\n[ Download thumbnail 4 KB (200 x 51) ](//s24.q4cdn.com/101481333/files/doc_multimedia/2024/10/1008977763/seagate2015_2c_horizontal_pos@thumbnail.png)\n\n[ Download lowres 12 KB (480 x 122) ](//s24.q4cdn.com/101481333/files/doc_multimedia/2024/10/1008977763/seagate2015_2c_horizontal_pos@lowres.png)\n\n[ Download square 6 KB (250 x 250) ](//s24.q4cdn.com/101481333/files/doc_multimedia/2024/10/1008977763/seagate2015_2c_horizontal_pos@square.png)\n\n[View All News](https://investors.seagate.com/news/default.aspx)\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

We are excited by the strong product momentum which positions us\nwell to address customer demand while delivering profitable growth. Our confidence in Seagate’s future opportunities is\nreflected in the decision to raise the quarterly dividend as announced today,” Mosley concluded.\nQuarterly Financial Results\nGAAP Non-GAAP\nFQ1 2025 FQ1 2024 FQ1 2025 FQ1 2024\nRevenue ($M) $ 2,168 $ 1,454 $ 2,168 $ 1,454\nGross Margin 32.9 % 10.2 % 33.3 % 19.8 %\nOperating Margin 18.6 % (8.9) % 20.4 % 2.8 %\nNet Income (Loss) ($M) $ 305 $ (184) $ 337 $ (46)\nDiluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share $ 1.41 $ (0.88) $ 1.58 $ (0.22)\nFor a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results, see accompanying financial tables.\nDuring the fiscal first quarter the Company generated $95 million in cash flow from operations, $27 million in free cash flow,\nand returned $147 million of capital to shareholders through its quarterly dividend. As of the end of the quarter, cash and cash\nequivalents totaled $1.2 billion, and there were 211 million ordinary shares issued and outstanding.\nSeagate has issued a Supplemental Financial Information document, which is available on Seagate’s Investor Relations website\nat investors.seagate.com.\nQuarterly Cash Dividend\nThe Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.72 per share, which will be\npayable on January 6, 2025 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 15, 2024. The payment of any\nfuture quarterly dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent upon Seagate’s financial position, results\nof operations, available cash, cash flow, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe business outlook for the fiscal second quarter 2025 is based on our current assumptions and expectations; actual results\nmay differ materially as a result of, among other things, the important factors discussed in the Cautionary Note Regarding\nForward-Looking Statements section of this release.\nThe Company is providing the following guidance for its fiscal second quarter 2025:\n• Revenue of $2.30 billion, plus or minus $150 million\n• Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.85, plus or minus $0.20\nGuidance regarding non-GAAP diluted EPS excludes known pre-tax charges related to estimated share-based compensation\nexpenses of $0.22 per share.\nWe have not reconciled our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance for fiscal second quarter 2025 to the most directly comparable\nGAAP measure, other than estimated share-based compensation expenses, because material items that may impact these\nmeasures are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, including, but not limited to net (gain) loss recognized\nfrom early redemption of debt, purchase order cancellation fees, strategic investment losses (gains) or impairment charges,\nincome tax adjustments on these measures, and other charges or benefits that may arise. The amounts of these measures are not\ncurrently available but may be material to future results. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance for fiscal\nsecond quarter 2025 to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. A reconciliation of our\nhistorical non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest GAAP equivalent is contained in this release.\nInvestor Communications\nSeagate management will hold a public webcast today at 2:00 PM PT / 5:00 PM ET that can be accessed on its Investor\nRelations website at investors.seagate.com.\nAn archived audio webcast of this event will be available on Seagate’s Investor Relations website at investors.seagate.com\nshortly following the event conclusion.\nAbout Seagate\nSeagate Technology is a leading innovator of mass-capacity data storage.

Exclusion of these amounts provides a\nsupplemental view of the Company's operating performance to investors to enable them to evaluate the Company's current\noperating performance compared to the past periods' operating performance.\nNet gain from business divestiture\nThe Company recorded a pre-tax net gain of $313 million in connection to the sale of System-on-Chip Operations in April\n2024. The net gain is excluded in the non-GAAP measures because it is not indicative of the Company's operating performance.\nThe Company excludes this amount to provide a supplemental view to investors to evaluate the Company's current operating\nperformance compared to the past periods' operating performance.\nNet loss (gain) from early redemption of debt and termination of interest rate swap\nFrom time to time, the Company incurs gains, losses and fees from the early redemption and repurchase of certain long-term\ndebt instruments and termination of related interest rate swap agreements. The amount of these charges may be inconsistent in\nsize and varies depending on the timing of the early redemption of debt and/or termination of interest rate swap. The Company\ndoes not believe these are part of its normal operating performance. Exclusion of these amounts provides a supplemental view\nof the Company's operating performance to investors to enable them to evaluate the Company's current operating performance\ncompared to the past periods' operating performance.\nPurchase order cancellation fees\nPurchase order cancellation fees are the costs incurred to cancel certain purchase commitments made with the Company's\nsuppliers for component and equipment purchases that will not be received due to change in forecasted demand. These charges\nare inconsistent in amount and frequency. The Company does not believe these are part of its normal operating expenses.\nExclusion of these amounts provides a supplemental view to investors to evaluate the Company's current operating performance\ncompared to the past periods’ operating performance.\nRestructuring and other, net\nRestructuring and other, net are costs associated with restructuring plans that are primarily related to costs associated with\nreduction in the Company’s workforce, exiting certain facilities and other related costs, as well as charges or gains from sale of\nproperties. These costs or benefits do not reflect the Company’s normal or ongoing operating performance and consequently the\nCompany excludes these expenses to provide a supplemental view to investors to evaluate the Company's current operating\nperformance compared to the past periods’ operating performance.\nShare-based compensation\nThese expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee share-based compensation. Given the variety of equity awards used\nby companies, the varying methodologies for determining share-based compensation expense, the subjective assumptions\ninvolved in those determinations, and the volatility in valuations that can be driven by market conditions outside the Company’s\ncontrol, the Company believes excluding share-based compensation expense enhances the ability of management and investors\nto understand and assess the underlying performance of its business over time and compare it against the Company’s peers, a\nmajority of whom also exclude share-based compensation expense from their non-GAAP results.\nStrategic investment gains, losses and impairment charges\nFrom time to time, the Company incurs gains, losses or impairment charges from strategic investments that are measured and\naccounted at fair value, under the equity method of accounting, as available-for-sale debt securities or adjust for downward or\nupward adjustments to the carrying value under the measurement alternative if an impairment or observable price adjustment is\nrecognized in the current period that are not considered normal operating expenses or gains. The resulting expense, gain or\nimpairment loss is inconsistent in amount and frequency and the Company excludes these amounts to provide a supplemental\nview to investors to evaluate the Company's current operating performance compared to the past periods’ operating\nperformance.\nOther charges\nThe other charges primarily include IT transformation costs. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are\nexcluded to provide a supplemental view to investors to evaluate the Company's current operating performance compared to\npast periods’ operating performance.\nIncome tax adjustments\nProvision or benefit for income taxes represents the tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments determined using a hybrid with and\nwithout method and effective tax rate for the applicable adjustment and jurisdiction.\nNon-GAAP diluted share count adjustments\nUsing the if-converted method, diluted net income per share is calculated assuming that the excess value above the principal of\nthe 2028 exchangeable notes were converted solely into shares of common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless\nthe result would be anti-dilutive. Non-GAAP shares used in diluted net income per share calculation excluded certain dilutive\nshares, which are expected to be offset partially or in full by the capped call transactions entered by the Company in\nconjunction with our 2028 exchangeable senior notes in order to reduce the potential dilution to the Company’s ordinary shares\nupon the conversion.\nFree cash flow\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities less acquisition of property,\nequipment and leasehold improvements. Free cash flow does not reflect non-cash items, net cash used or provided by financing\nactivities and net cash used or provided by investing activities, other than acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold\nimprovements. This non-GAAP financial measure is used by management to assess the Company's sources of liquidity, capital\nstructure and operating performance.\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and last twelve months (LTM) adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before income tax expense, interest expense, interest income, depreciation and\namortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain expenses, gains and losses that the Company believes are not indicative of its\ncore operating results. These adjustments primarily include impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts, net loss\n(gain) from early redemption of debt, net gain from termination of interest rate swap, net gain from business divestiture,\npurchase order cancellation fees, restructuring and other, net, share-based compensation, strategic investment losses or\nimpairment charges, other extraordinary charges such as factory underutilization charges. LTM adjusted EBITDA is defined as\nthe total of last twelve months adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management to evaluate the\nCompany’s debt portfolio and structure to comply with its financial debt covenants."

Seagate delivered a strong start to the fiscal year with revenue growing\nnearly 50% and non-GAAP gross profit increasing over 150% compared with the prior year period.\nThese results demonstrate our ability to drive profitable growth, which is the outcome of sustained supply\ndiscipline and the strategic cost efficiencies that we have built into our operations.\n3\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSeagate Technology Holdings Plc\n(STX) Corrected Transcript\nQ1 2025 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nFiscal first quarter revenue came in at $2.17 billion and non-GAAP EPS was $1.58, both were above the midpoint\nof our guidance range, benefiting from a better-than-anticipated mass capacity product mix and an improved\npricing environment.\nContinuing cloud demand strength coupled with improvement in the enterprise and OEM markets, drove top line\ngrowth and also contributed to enhanced profitability. Company non-GAAP gross margin expanded by 240 basis\npoints sequentially to 33.3%, the highest level in over a decade. This impressive performance was driven by our\nHDD business, with non-GAAP gross margins now in the mid-30% range.\nAmid a healthy industry supply/demand environment, we anticipate further margin expansion opportunities as we\nramp our portfolio of high-capacity nearline drives, including our Mozaic based HAMR products, which I'll discuss\nshortly. The increasingly favorable business landscape combined with our industry-leading technology road map,\nlends growing confidence in Seagate's future opportunities. Reflecting this confidence, we are increasing our\nquarterly dividend by nearly 3%.\nOur optimism is reinforced by our build-to-order model, which provides us with good demand visibility over the\nnext few quarters. We see the potential for significant revenue growth for fiscal 2025, inclusive of the seasonal\ndemand fluctuation that is typical for the March quarter. We are maintaining supply discipline, and we'll address\nnear-term exabyte demand growth by efficiently leveraging our available capacity. Beyond that, we are well-\npositioned to support further demand growth, mainly through technology node transitions with HAMR playing a\nvital role, as we complete qualifications and ramp shipments.\nTurning to the mass capacity market trends. Cloud demand for our nearline drives remains robust, and we believe\ncustomers are managing their inventory levels well. In the September quarter, revenue growth was driven by US\ncloud providers, though we continue to see positive demand trends globally. For instance, some customers have\nhighlighted the growing use of video content on e-commerce and social media platforms. Data indicates that\nvideo is the most effective format for engaging digital audiences.\nFurthermore, research suggests that longer-form video content and personalization through AI technology can\nsignificantly enhance revenue generation opportunities for our customers. These trends bode well for mass\ncapacity HDDs, which are ideally suited for storing large and diverse data-intensive video content. HDDs\ncomprise close to 90% of bytes stored in public cloud environments and we are confident that proportion will hold\nfor the foreseeable future.\nAmong the enterprise and OEM customers, we observed the first meaningful uptick in nearline demand following\na multi-quarter period of stability. This increase reflects an improvement in traditional server demand, as well as\nhigher storage content per unit, pushing the average capacity per enterprise drive to a new record high. In the VIA\nmarkets, sales remained stable in the September quarter and slightly ahead of our expectations. We are\nwitnessing a shift towards more cloud-like storage solutions that utilize higher capacity drives.\nThis transition is due in part to longer data retention needs and increased video analytics. Our HDD solutions,\nincluding Mozaic HAMR products, provide cost efficiency and scalability to our VIA customers' evolving demands.\nThese same advantages are also crucial for generative AI applications, which is why we continue to believe gen\nAI will be a driver of mass capacity storage simply by being a powerful catalyst for data creation. HDDs provide a\ntrusted, economical and secure platform to host data that feeds into AI engines and preserves the content\nproduced by AI-powered applications.\n4\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSeagate Technology Holdings Plc\n(STX) Corrected Transcript\nQ1 2025 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nThis data is ultimately fed back into the AI training models in a continuous cycle. As data center architects prepare\nfor gen AI to move into the widespread adoption phase, they continue to grapple with cost, scale and power\nchallenges. Seagate's product road map is addressing each of these key challenges. Compared with NAND-\nbased storage alternatives, our HDD solutions offer approximately 6 times lower cost per terabyte, and HDDs are\nroughly 9 times more capital efficient, delivering the economies of scale necessary to support the anticipated\nsurge in data demand. And according to cloud customers, HDDs have 10 times lower embodied carbon per\nterabyte relative to NAND, which can translate into a much lower carbon footprint, very important given the world's\ngrowing number of data centers.\nThat provides a good segue into our product ramp and qualification plans. We have three primary areas of focus\nfor fiscal 2025 aimed at driving profitable growth over the long term, and we're progressing on all of them. They\ninclude ramping the company's last PMR platform, expanding Mozaic adoption and executing our Mozaic product\nroad map that will enable Seagate to address the breadth of customers' mass capacity storage needs.\nConsistent with our plans, we began to aggressively ramp our final PMR platform in the September quarter, which\nis currently up to 28 terabytes in capacity. We are very pleased with the pace of customer adoption. These drives\nhave quickly catapulted to our second-highest revenue product, and we're continuing to both ramp volume and\nbroaden our customer base in the December quarter.\nWe've expanded customer qualifications on our 3+ terabyte per disk Mozaic HAMR-based platform with a few\ncustomer quals already completed, spanning the enterprise nearline, VIA and NAS market segments. The\nqualification with our lead CSP customer is progressing well through what has been a very intensive and thorough\ntesting process. The learnings that we have gained are already being leveraged in the future customer\nqualifications and product generations. To that end, HAMR qualification drives are now in the hands of multiple\nglobal cloud and enterprise customers.\nOur expectation for shipment and revenue ramp timing across the broader customer base still points to mid-\ncalendar 2025. Our confidence in HAMR technology remains strong, and customer feedback has reinforced our\nvalue proposition that the Mozaic platform provides the foundational technologies required to satisfy high-capacity\nstorage requirements at the lowest total cost of ownership.\nWe expect to extend our technology leadership as we deliver on the next stage of our HAMR road map, the 4+\nterabyte per disk platform. As a reminder, the step function capacity increase to 4 terabytes per disk is being\nachieved entirely through areal density gains, supporting our cost per terabyte reduction path, with additional\nbenefit to both customer TCO and Seagate's structurally improved margin profile.\nIn closing, Seagate is performing well amid an improving demand backdrop with healthy industry supply\ndynamics. We are at an exciting inflection point rooted in the structural changes we've made to our business and\nwith our compelling technology road map. These factors underpin our ability to build on the last four quarters of\nstrong sequential performance and drive future profitable growth to create long-term value for our customers and\nstakeholders.\nThank you. And I'll now hand it off to Gianluca.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nGianluca Romano\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nThank you, Dave. Seagate started fiscal 2025 delivering strong revenue and profitability growth for a fourth\nconsecutive quarter. September quarter revenue was $2.17 billion, up 15% sequentially and 49% year-over-year.\n5\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSeagate Technology Holdings Plc\n(STX) Corrected Transcript\nQ1 2025 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nWe increased non-GAAP operating income 35% sequentially to $442 million, translating to a non-GAAP operating\nmargin of 20.4% revenue. And our non-GAAP EPS was $1.58 at the high end of our guidance range and\nreflecting improving demand trends, ongoing price adjustment and continued cost discipline.\nWithin our hard disk drive business, exabyte shipments grew 20% sequentially to 138 exabytes, and revenue\nincreased 16% to $2 billion. Mass capacity revenue grew for the fifth consecutive quarter, more than offsetting the\nexpected decline in the legacy business. Mass capacity revenue was $1.7 billion, up 21% sequentially, driven by\ncontinued strength in nearline cloud demand along with a significant uptick in nearline enterprise sales.\nMass capacity shipments totaled 128 exabytes compared with 104 exabytes in the June quarter, up 23%\nsequentially. Mass capacity shipments now represent a record 93% of total HDD exabyte, reflecting the continued\nlong-term secular growth for cost-efficient scalable storage.\nAs planned, we began to ramp our 24 terabytes and 28 terabytes PMR, which helped to boost Seagate nearline\nshipment to 109 exabytes in the quarter, up from 84 exabytes in the prior period. As Dave highlighted earlier,\ncustomer reception for this product has been strong and represented more than 20% of our nearline revenue in\nthe September quarter. We expect nearline demand will continue to improve in the December quarter, as\nshipment for our latest high-capacity products broaden across global CSP and enterprise customers.\nDemand for our VIA products remained relatively stable in the September quarter, and we currently project similar\nrevenue in the December quarter. Smart city project remain a key demand driver for VIA products worldwide, and\nregional economic conditions play a key factor in budget decision for the new projects. The ongoing, economic\nuncertainties in China has been a headwind for the VIA business in that market. We are cautiously optimistic that\nrecently announced stimulus plan in China would positively impact on VIA demand over time.\nSales of our legacy products totaled $270 million, representing roughly 12% of total revenue. The remaining 8%\nof revenue was derived from our other businesses, which held steady at $164 million. The other businesses\ninclude system, SSD and refurbished drives, a business that has grown by about 25% year-over-year and\nincludes drives under our circularity programs.\nMoving on to the rest of the income statement. Non-GAAP gross profit increased 24% sequentially in the\nSeptember quarter to $723 million. This significant increase reflects a favorable mix shift to our mass capacity\nproducts, continued price adjustment and ongoing cost efficiency in improving demand environment.\nOur resulting non-GAAP gross margin was 33.3% at the company level. Overall non-GAAP gross margin\nexpanded by 240 basis points quarter-over-quarter, which was slightly more than we had originally anticipated.\nNon-GAAP gross margin for the HDD business and mass capacity, in particular, remains significantly higher than\nthe corporate average.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses totaled $281 million, up 10% quarter-over-quarter and above our original plan,\nlargely due to higher variable compensation commensurate with improved profitability levels. Other income and\nexpense were $86 million, and we project similar levels in the December quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA continued to improve and was up 23% sequentially in the September quarter to $498 million.\nNon-GAAP net income increased to $337 million, resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $1.58 per share based on a\ndiluted share count of approximately 213 million shares.\n6\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSeagate Technology Holdings Plc\n(STX) Corrected Transcript\nQ1 2025 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nMoving on to cash flow and the balance sheet. Free cash flow generation was $27 million, reflecting our initial\nsteps to normalize working capital to support our supply chain while at the same time, meeting increasing mass\ncapacity demand. It will take a couple of more quarters for working capital to fully adjust, which will have some\nimpact to free cash flow generation. Even so, we expect free cash flow to improve in the December quarter and\nthrough the rest of the fiscal year.\nCapital expenditures for the quarter were $68 million for fiscal 2025. We will maintain capital discipline and\ncontinue to expect CapEx to be at the low end of the long-term target range of 4% to 6% of revenue. We returned\n$147 million to shareholders through the quarterly dividend exiting the quarter with 211 million shares\noutstanding. As Dave mentioned earlier, the company approved an increase to our quarterly dividend, raising the\nquarterly payout to $0.72 per share, reflecting our long-term confidence in the business.\nWe closed the September quarter with $2.7 billion in available liquidity, including our undrawn revolving credit\nfacility. Inventory increased to $1.4 billion including material that we are staging in support of improving mass\ncapacity demand.\nOur debt balance was $5.7 billion at the end of the September quarter, with more than 90% of our long-term debt\nobligation maturing in fiscal 2027 and beyond. We exited the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 3.2 times and\nexpect to see further reduction in the coming quarters.\nTurning now to our outlook. Mass capacity revenue continue to trend higher, with growth driven by global cloud\ncustomer demand for our high capacity nearline drives, along with ongoing improvement in the enterprise and\nOEM markets. These positive trends are expected to more than offset lower sales into the legacy and other\nmarkets, we anticipate profit to further expand from the richer mix of mass capacity revenue that I just described\nand ongoing pricing actions.\nWith that as a context, December quarter revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.3 billion, plus or minus\n$150 million. At the midpoint, this represent an increase of 6% sequentially and 48% year-over-year. Non-GAAP\noperating expenses are expected to be in the range of $285 million. At the midpoint of our revenue guidance, we\nexpect non-GAAP operating margin to expand into the low 20s percentage range. We expect our non-GAAP EPS\nto be $1.85 plus or minus $0.20 based on a diluted share count of approximately 214 million shares and a non-\nGAAP tax expense of about $20 million.\nI will now turn the call back to Dave for final comments.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nWilliam David Mosley\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nThanks, Gianluca. In closing, Seagate is achieving significant profitability expansion in a favorable demand\nenvironment. I'm confident that the structural improvements we have implemented and our differentiated\ntechnology road map will further enhance said profitability and meet the evolving requirements of our customers.\nDemand for our high capacity nearline drives remained strong and we will build on that momentum to deliver\nscalable, cost-efficient storage solutions to support the anticipated growth in data demand, including from GenAI\napplications.\nSeagate's dedicated global team, strong business model and technology leadership form a winning combination\nthat positions us well for future success and underscores our confidence in deploying capital and enhancing value\nfor our shareholders.\n7\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSeagate Technology Holdings Plc\n(STX) Corrected Transcript\nQ1 2025 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nOperator, let's now open up the call for questions.\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question\ntoday comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nWamsi Mohan Q\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nYes. Thank you so much. Dave, I was wondering if you could flesh out a little bit your commentary around this\nbuild to order and very good demand visibility into this fiscal year. You noted significant demand growth, including\nsome seasonality that you typically expect around March quarter. I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate a\nbit on maybe some bookends around what you're thinking around demand growth as March quarter seasonality\ngoing to be different from what you've experienced before.\nAnd I'd be curious to also hear your thoughts around, if I could, how you're expecting to compete versus your\ncompetitors' products, which have slightly higher capacities currently as you're ramping HAMR. It sounds like\nHAMR gets there sort of mid next year in volume. Thank you so much.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nWilliam David Mosley A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nThanks, Wamsi. So, a couple of things. If I go back at six months ago or a year ago, we instilled these build-to-\norder models largely to get predictability, and I think it's working well. As we look into the next year, we're\nconfident that we booked those quarters pretty well. So, I'm very happy the way we're running the business given\nthat predictability. And we're only going to build what we need to build.\nWe're still not fully recovered as an industry from what we just went through a couple of years ago. So, I'm quite\npleased with how the build-to-order models have gone. There is some seasonality in some markets as you allude\nto, and we'll watch that carefully. But I think everyone is a little cautious on next year. From a cloud perspective, I\ndon't think inventory is built up any, I think the buffers are still low from my perspective. And so, I think we are\nhappy with the cloud predictability, the mass capacity predictability from here.\nOn the second part, I think from a capacity point leadership perspective, we're shipping the leading products.\nFrom a CMR perspective, no one else is shipping over 30 terabytes for sure. And as we mentioned in the\nprepared remarks, there's capacity points even higher net going up. And if we put SMR on top of that, we can\nqual even higher. So, I'm very comfortable with our positions there. So, I'm not quite sure exactly what you're\nreferring to on capacity leadership or lack of leadership. I mean, from our perspective, we've got to get all the\nquals and all the ramps done, and so on. And then we get on to 4 terabytes of disk and so on. We're very\ncomfortable with our technology portfolio that way.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nWamsi Mohan Q\nAnalyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nThanks, Dave.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n8\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSeagate Technology Holdings Plc\n(STX) Corrected Transcript\nQ1 2025 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nKrish Sankar Q\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\nYeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Dave, I have a question on your market share. Historically, you're more\nin the mid-40s, but last few quarters, it's kind of dipped down to a 30% to high 30% range. Can you talk about the\nfactors that are behind the low share? Is it potential disruption from HAMR causing temporary share loss? Is it\ncustomer specific where WD customers are ordering more than yours? And along the same path, how to think\nabout the industry pricing in calendar 2025? It's been extremely rational in HDD. How do you think about it in\n2025? Thank you.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nWilliam David Mosley A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nThanks, Krish. Yeah, for market share, I've said a number of times, market share is an outcome of running your\nplay. And exactly to Wamsi's question, we changed our plays a year ago when we said we want this build to\norder. So, we said, I want predictability, longer time horizon rather than we're building a bunch and then hoping to\npush it into a channel and going for market share or something like that. I think when we were at the bottom of the\ndemand cycle, market share doesn't really matter. It's more the predictability of the cash that you're generating\nand so on.\nAs we get back into things, obviously, we're taking – now that the margins are higher, we're getting rewarded for\nthe money that we extend and the investments we've made and so on. Then we'll clearly take more of that\ndemand our way. And so, I think the market share will re-equilibrate. From an exabyte share perspective, I think\nwe'll be just fine because as customers want to continue to push the TCO proposition going to higher and higher\ncapacity points, I think we're going to be fine there. On the pricing side, I think I'll let Gianluca answer the question\nthere.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nGianluca Romano A\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nYeah. Thank you, Dave. Yeah, I think the pricing environment continue to be positive for the industry. Every\nquarter we have seen a little bit of improvement and this is what is also driving our gross margin higher a little bit,\nevery quarter. As you know, on the cost side, we still had some unused capacity in the June quarter. And in\nSeptember quarter, we don't have any of those extra costs. So we also had a little bit of that help in the gross\nmargin.\nAnd going into December, if you look at how we guided, we expect further improvement in gross margin, further\nimprovement in operating margin, which is, of course, very important to us. And that is coming from the mix,\nramping more of our latest PMR product. Of course, we also have a certain volume of HAMR in our December\nquarter and the pricing action that is still ongoing and we have a good balance between supply/demand in general\nfor Seagate and I think for the industry, and we are continuing for our long-term strategy.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nKrish Sankar Q\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\nThanks, Dave. Thanks, Gianluca.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: And our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n9\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSeagate Technology Holdings Plc\n(STX) Corrected Transcript\nQ1 2025 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nAmit Daryanani Q\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, the question really, Dave, is around there's always this\nfear that the HDD industry broadly, Seagate specifically, are sitting at these cyclical peak levels. I'd love to get\nyour perspective, as you look at the exabyte shipment that you have right now, how do you get confidence that\nwhat you're shipping is actually getting deployed by your customers versus, perhaps, ending up in inventory for\nthem? How do you kind of gain that confidence?\nAnd then, really related to that cyclical fear, I would say, you folks sound very confident that there's a lot more\nupside to gross margins versus where you are today, which is actually above your long-term target. What do you\nthink is the appropriate margin frame for Seagate as you go forward now?\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nWilliam David Mosley A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nThanks, Amit. Yes, we have run a cyclical business over the many, many years. I think it's changed quite a bit as\nwe came down from client server. There used to be lot of seasonality in that market. And now, as we're in the\ncloud, the cyclicality, I'm not sure it's totally periodical, but the pandemic, in particular, caused a very big bubble\nand then a big crash on the back side of it. So I think that's kind of an anomaly there.\nHow do we know what customers actually have? We have to triangulate ourselves, and I think we've really\nimproved our processes for being able to do that. But we're also not pushing in nearly as many drives, total units\nor exabyte points. And some of that's – the build-to-order model, actually, helps us with quite a bit. So that we\nknow that we're not overbuilding if you were planning to overbuild.\nExactly to your point on upsides to gross margin, I mean, we believe that the way we bring on more capacity is to\ndrive for more areal density gains, and we have to go work the cost on those platforms. And that's what we're\nreally focused on doing, making sure that we can introduce terabytes in the 20s and 30s and 40s with lower and\nlower costs to be able to serve the market. A good TCO proposition for our customers who are building data\ncenters, and we want to support data centers for a long time, is to put more capacity online because it's so much\nmore efficient for them. But we need to be able to get that efficiency through our continued cost reduction also. So\nI do think there's significant upside to gross margin still. But it all starts, to your point, with supply and demand –\nmanaging supply and demand properly.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nErik W. Woodring Q\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nGreat. Thank you, guys, for taking my question. Gianluca, maybe if we just stay on the theme of gross margins\nhere. I think your guidance for the December quarter implies about a 34% gross margin, up roughly 70 basis\npoints sequentially. You've been growing gross margins by about 2 to 4 points sequentially over the last four\nquarters. And so, I'm just wondering, if pricing and mix are still favorable. And obviously, Dave just made some\npositive comments on gross margins. Can you help me understand why we might not be seeing more gross\nmargin expansion in the quarter, again, relative to the multiple points of gross margin expansion you've been able\nto drive over the last 12 months? Thanks so much.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n10\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSeagate Technology Holdings Plc\n(STX) Corrected Transcript\nQ1 2025 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nGianluca Romano A\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nYes, Erik. Well, as I said before, in the September quarter, we also had the support from better cost structure\nbecause of higher capacity and the elimination of the underutilization charges. That was about 100 basis points in\nour gross margin improvement. We are not going to have that improvement in the December quarter because\nnow we don't have any other underutilization charges anymore.\nBut we are still progressing with our pricing structure, and we are making a good ramp of our latest PMR product,\nand we will see some volume on HAMR. So all those are positive. And as you know, we guide based on forecast\nthat we have at the beginning of the quarter, and then we execute during the quarter as best as we can. And our\nfocus is to keep improving quarter-after-quarter. We are not trying to increase too much at one time. We want be\nconsistent and keep this cycle up for as long as we can.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nToshiya Hari Q\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\nHi. Thank you so much for taking the question. I had a multipart one on HAMR. I think on the last call or at a\nconference, you guys talked about your expectation around getting qualification at your lead customer in Q3, I\nbelieve. Is that now Q4? Is that early 2025? Any thoughts on that would be helpful.\nAnd then, Dave, you talked about additional cloud companies – or customers having qualification products on\nhand. Should we expect the qualification process at some of those customers to be smoother than your lead\ncustomer, given sort of the debugging process that you've been through over the past year or so? Thank you.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nWilliam David Mosley A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nYeah. Thanks, Toshiya. Yeah, the failure mode that slowed us down as we ramp to high volume this spring and\nsummer is behind us. The teams worked really hard to make sure we get all the process improvements that we\ntalked about last time in.\nI did speak on last earnings call about the – our confidence was based on the test beds that we have running that\nare all designed to detect these fail modes with intense stresses that are way beyond our spec. And here we are\nanother quarter later, we have more drives, more configurations, running more modes of tests, and we haven't\nseen hide nor hair of the failure mode. So we're confident that it's behind us. That's that initial learning that we get\nrelative to proving it. Sometimes it takes a little bit of time with the customers to prove it, but I'm confident we're\ngoing to be able to prove it right now, and those tests are ongoing.\nThe customers know exactly where we are. When we think about qualifications, there is a lot of different facets to\nquals, it's interoperability and different data center applications and so on and so forth. No significant concerns\nthere. It really does come down to this one last issue. And that's why we have confidence that no one else is\ngoing to see it because as we ramp to high volume, those other customer – we've got this problem fixed, I'd say,\nthose other customers wouldn't. Some multiple non-cloud customers have already qualified the product and we're\nalready getting volume shipments there. They run tough quals themselves, but may not have these same kinds of\nstresses. But now that we have the recipe, I think we're going to apply it to everyone.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n11\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSeagate Technology Holdings Plc\n(STX) Corrected Transcript\nQ1 2025 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nToshiya Hari Q\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\nThank you.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAsiya Merchant Q\nAnalyst, Citigroup Global Markets Canada, Inc.\nGreat. Thank you very much. As you guys ramp HAMR and you start to see more qualifications and more\nshipments, let's say, your December and into the March, how – is that a negative to gross margins, just given the\nshipment volumes are lower, there might be some ramp issues there. How should we think about overall impact\nto margins as HAMR ramps? And I get the sense that, obviously, once you guys are much further along, that's a\nmargin driver. But near term, how should we think about the impact to margins from HAMR ramping? Thank you.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nWilliam David Mosley A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nAsiya, yeah, near term, we don't want to give it away. Long term, we don't want to give it away. So, we definitely\nwant HAMR to be accretive to gross margin. And we think it does add benefit to our customers as well. So there's\na trade-off. Do they want to increase the higher – the capacity for the data center build-outs that they're doing.\nAnd then we have to say – you have to make sure you pay for it to replace the drives. As we said before, our\nfactories are largely full, so to take drives out of those – or take the supply out and turn it over to HAMR, we have\nto make sure we're getting paid for it. And I'm confident we can do that in the near term as well. It's just a matter\nof managing the supply and demand picture properly.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nGianluca Romano A\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nYeah. I'll say on the cost side, a similar level of volume. HAMR cost per terabyte is below the PMR cost per\nterabyte. So, for sure, there is an advantage on HAMR. And the pricing, of course, depends on the timing and\nwhere we are in the cycle. But at this point, in the short term, there is no reason why HAMR should not be\naccretive to our gross margin.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAaron Rakers Q\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC\nYeah. Thanks for taking the – thanks for taking the question. So, a couple of just real quick model questions. It\nlooks like your OpEx was a little bit higher than you expected in this quarter. I'm curious, relative to the $285\nmillion guide, how do we think about the trajectory of operating expenses as we look out into the March quarter\nbeyond any kind of framework of what kind of we could think about from a normalizing operating expense\nperspective?\nAnd then as the – kind of quick follow-on. As you get the, I think, it's $480 million of debt maturing in January,\nfrom that level, how are you thinking about the possibility of reentering share repurchase activity going forward?\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n12\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSeagate Technology Holdings Plc\n(STX) Corrected Transcript\nQ1 2025 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nGianluca Romano A\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nYes. On the OpEx, the increase between June and September is only due to variable compensation. So, we are\nnot hiring more people. It's just a matter of – last year, we didn't have variable comp. And this year, we have\nvariable comp at a fairly good level. So, from here, I would say, probably we stay fairly flat through the rest of the\nfiscal year, around $280 million to $285 million, I think that is the new range.\nThe debt, as you said, is maturing in beginning of January. So, as we said before, we are going to address that\nwith cash on hand. So we start reducing our debt. We want to be even little bit lower before we'll start share\nbuybacks. So I'll say, as you know, we have increased dividend that is a top priority for the company, and then we\nwant to take care of the debt. And then after that, we will look at share buyback, probably a little bit further in time.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAaron Rakers Q\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC\nYes. Thank you\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nGianluca Romano A\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nThank you.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: And our next question today will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nTimothy Arcuri Q\nAnalyst, UBS Securities, LLC\nThanks a lot. I had a question about the capacity outlook now given that you're just kind of bumping up against\nyour max today. So, unless you decide to add more, you're – I mean you're going to ship close to that 130\nexabyte of nearline, probably not in December, but quite soon. So, I mean you're growing nicely off the bottom on\nmix and on exabytes coming back. But if you're not going to expand capacity, should we think of things starting to\nflatten off from here? And I realize that pricing is going to go up. But it seems like you kind of lose a degree of\nfreedom in the model unless you start to expand exabyte capacity. Thanks.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nWilliam David Mosley A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nYeah, Tim, I think exactly to your point, we'll expand exabyte capacity by transitioning to new products. And so, if\nyou think about it, as I go to from 20 terabytes-ish to 30 terabytes-ish to even 40 terabytes someday, we'll be able\nto expand exabyte capacity without adding significant capacity from a driver heads or media perspective. We'll\njust use it much more efficiently on an exabyte basis. And that's where we're confident that we'll be able to also\ntake out cost at those higher capacity points, which is what builds into the margin proposition into the model.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: And our next question today comes from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nC.J. Muse Q\nAnalyst, Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.\nYeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Dave, in your prepared remarks, you talked about good\nvisibility for growth in fiscal 2025 notwithstanding seasonality for March. So, I was hoping you could kind of speak\n13\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSeagate Technology Holdings Plc\n(STX) Corrected Transcript\nQ1 2025 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nto where your visibility is today for nearline? Is it three, six, nine months? And then, based on that backdrop, how\nshould we be thinking about, at least for mass capacity, what seasonality will look like into the March quarter?\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nWilliam David Mosley A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nYeah. I think mass capacity is pretty full, and it goes out that nine-month period that you talked about, C.J. And\nthat's a virtue of the build-to-order model that we've actually established on. I think customers understand that.\nThey get predictable economics. And we're all going through these qualification processes so they get access to\nthat technology as well. That's all serving as well.\nI think right now, I would say the total demand is not significantly higher than historical demands. And I certainly\ndon't think there's inventory buildup going in or anything. So, I don't think there's a cycle coming. I think we're\nrunning a fairly predictable business. And we'll get better visibility as we get through, obviously, early next year.\nPeople are re-upping, if you will, the build-to-order configurations. But right now, I feel fairly confident certainly\nthrough the front half of the year and probably even into the back half of the year.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nGianluca Romano A\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nYeah. On the seasonality, C.J., usually, the majority of the seasonality is on the legacy part of the business where\nthe March quarter is a lower quarter -slowest quarter in the year. But we also have part of mass capacity, in\nparticular, VIA, so the surveillance part of the business, that is usually fairly weak in March and they start to grow\nin June and is fairly strong in September and December. So, when you model your four quarters for calendar\n2025 or consider that there is seasonality not only in the legacy part, but also in some of the mass capacity\nproducts.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nC.J. Muse Q\nAnalyst, Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nGianluca Romano A\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nThank you.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nWilliam David Mosley A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nThanks.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors LLC.

Fox Q\nAnalyst, Fox Advisors LLC\nThanks for taking my question. Good afternoon, guys. I guess just following up on the point on how much capacity\nyou have available. I think I understand how you create capacity when you go from like 3 terabytes per platter to 4\nterabytes per platter. But from here, going over, say, the next 12 months, I think last quarter you talked about\ndebottlenecking. There's a potential that maybe you do get a better cycle in enterprise and VIA next year.

If the edge really turns on, if\ngen AI turns on, which I would say is still very, very early innings of that, if there's some kind of macro recovery in\nall the markets. And we're not there yet. We're still being very cautious on any supply. And any additional supply\nwe would have to put on would be very long lead time. So, we can satisfy more exabytes exactly as you\ndescribed, and we've talked about earlier. But additional drive demand, if you will, I think we'd have to add supply,\nwhich would be much longer lead time.\nAs we spend 4% of our revenue on CapEx, we do add technology transition capacity, so you get some small\ncapacity adds because of that. As you're buying new tools, they tend to be more efficient. But the growth would be\nnecessarily slow, I think.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nSteven B. Fox Q\nAnalyst, Fox Advisors LLC\nOkay. That's helpful. Thank you.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Ananda Baruha (sic) [Ananda Baruah] with Loop Capital.\nPlease go ahead.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAnanda Baruah Q\nAnalyst, Loop Capital Markets LLC\nYeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Dave, sort of sticking right there on the\ncapacity question. If things progress as you anticipate with HAMR in the event that even with HAMR and areal\ndensity increases, sort of data increases, gen AI, video apps, et cetera, all of that were to put you in a position\nwhere you to want to be increasing capacity. You just mentioned long lead times, what is that process? Can you\ngive us some sense of what that process could look like? We've also heard about just kind of the whole\ncomponent change that you have also needs to be tended to, I guess, just what would be the ways that you guys\ncould maybe generate that. That would be helpful. Thanks a lot.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nWilliam David Mosley A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nYeah. Thanks, Ananda. I think that we fixate in our industry on highest capacity point. And obviously, that's the –\nmax capacity gets a lot of attention. But when you get into the growth of some of these other markets, we would\nbe talking about 20 terabytes or maybe even less than that. What's your value prop at that level. And by pushing\nforward in areal density, we get to take components out of those capacity points. So, we can actually hit much\nmore aggressive price trends if we want to and still maintain really good margins.\nAnd then those components that are freed up go – you can make twice as many drives with half the components\ngoing – being dedicated to each drive, right? So, I think that's where if we saw resurgence, areal density helps\nsolve a lot of problems because you can go address those markets that are half capacity, if you will, of the max\ncapacity in a much more efficient way.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n15\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSeagate Technology Holdings Plc\n(STX) Corrected Transcript\nQ1 2025 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nAnanda Baruah Q\nAnalyst, Loop Capital Markets LLC\nI got it. That's super helpful. And just to complete that, does that mean like even in like a strong case with HAMR,\nyou guys feel pretty good when you sort of map out ability to hit exabytes shipped for the industry for a good\namount of time to come. I mean, measured in probably years, not months.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nGianluca Romano A\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nWell, it depends, right? We have our supply plan. If demand is much higher than our supply plan, of course, we\nwill have a little bit of unbalance that we have time to address. But our focus is on technology transition, is not on\nmore units. And we think this is the most profitable way for the industry to progress in this period of time, and this\nis what we want to do. So let's see where demand is in two or three quarters from now, but we know where our\nsupply will be.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nAnanda Baruah Q\nAnalyst, Loop Capital Markets LLC\nThanks, guys.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nGianluca Romano A\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nThanks.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh Q\nAnalyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC\nYeah. Hi, Dave. On the HAMR, just wondering if you can give – size the, what do you think unit shipments could\nbe for calendar 2025. And Gianluca, I think in the past, you've talked about trying to bring on some of the idled fab\ncapacity and head count as you start to bring some capacity back on. Can you lay out how that road map looks\nlike? Thanks.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nWilliam David Mosley A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nThanks, Vijay. Yeah, we didn't speak specifically about how many units and how fast we'll push. We said that\nmass qualification will be done for all these customers that we just shipped to probably by mid-2025.\nFrom my perspective, the factories are relatively full right now. And so, as we plan with those customers and they\nsay, hey, I'd like the exabytes in this form rather than this form, we'll make the transition, but it will be probably\nless of a transition than we would have made, say, a year ago when we had empty factories, we would have\nramped much more aggressively. This time, I think we'll make sure that we pivot accordingly and carefully.\nIt's very important to realize that the components that we use in our last generation of PMR product are very, very\nsimilar to the components we use in HAMR as well. So not the critical components, heads and media obviously,\nbut all of the other components. And so, we feel very comfortable being able to pivot from one product to the other\nif we have to. The mechanics, the electronics, there's still much leverage there. So that's what allows us that\nflexibility.\n16\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSeagate Technology Holdings Plc\n(STX) Corrected Transcript\nQ1 2025 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nGianluca Romano A\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nYeah. From a idle capacity standpoint, I would say at this point, we don't have much idle capacity anymore. So\nwhat we are doing is now moving faster into technology transition now with our latest PMR products that we are\nramping very aggressively already in the September and December quarter. And then, the transition to HAMR will\ngenerate a certain level of additional exabytes that will support the increasing demand.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh Q\nAnalyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC\nRight. Thank you, Dave and Gianluca.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nWilliam David Mosley A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nThanks, Vijay.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nThomas O'Malley Q\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Dave, if you would just humor me as I try to clarify things, too. But just\nin the back half, it sounds like you are fully at capacity and technology transitions are getting you some growth;\nand it sounds like that looks really good. It's obviously been a couple of really good quarters for you guys. But let's\njust say we head out into fiscal year 2026, you're talking about more volume per HAMR kind of coming in the\nmiddle of the next calendar year. And so, you would imagine more substantially into the next fiscal year for you\nguys.\nIf you guys were to see further delays on the HAMR side, what actions would you guys take just given the fact\nthat you're at capacity and from a factory perspective and you wouldn't see the technology transitions? Just walk\nme through what you would do in that instance. Obviously, that's not ideal and you're not planning for that, but\nwe've seen the qualification slip a couple quarters with the largest guy. So just want to understand how you guys\nthink about things if it's further delayed.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nWilliam David Mosley A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nYeah. I'm not really worried about it for exactly the reasons that you talked about. We see the how the test sets\nare running. We see how the qualifications are running, and we're very confident in being able to make the pivot.\nBut exactly to the earlier question, I think it was Vijay's question, we can pivot from the last generation PMR to the\nHAMR technology very, very easily. And last generation PMR is a great product for us with really good margins\nthat we're not fully ramped on yet either. So from that perspective, if it came out like one quarter of delay and\nsome customers said I want like this rather than like this, we can very easily pivot back.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nThomas O'Malley Q\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.\nHelpful. And then, in terms of just your outlook on AI, you obviously made some comments earlier on the call.\nYou're saying it's still kind of on the common terms of initial conversations with customers, do you have a\n17\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSeagate Technology Holdings Plc\n(STX) Corrected Transcript\nQ1 2025 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\ntimeframe of when you may start to see some contribution there? Is that something that would come as early as\nthis next fiscal year?\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nWilliam David Mosley A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nYeah. Thanks, Tom. This is a really complex topic because I think there's a lot of different things that are called\nAI. Some of them are traditional workloads that we've seen for years and years, and some of them are brand-new\nworkloads. And we are seeing demand that's coupled to brand new workloads, right, with purchase orders that\nreference specifically things that people would identify as predictive AI or gen AI applications. What I would say is\nthat the recent trends are really more towards video, which we talked about in our prepared remarks.\nAnd that's the biggest thing that we're seeing right now grow, and I'll call that AI for a while because I think it is a\nmuch more efficient way to drive our customers' business models, and we see that demand flowing through right\nnow. I don't think that there's a bubble going on in there. I think there is a continued value competition happening\nin a bunch of different vectors with new technologies, new applications coming that you could continue to drive\nvideo as a fundamental value store for our customers. That's why we're excited about it. And I know some people\ncall those traditional workloads, but I'll give credit to AI because I think they're being used in very interesting,\ncreative new ways.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Mark Miller with The Benchmark Co. Please go ahead.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMark Miller Q\nAnalyst, The Benchmark Co. LLC\nCongratulations on your upside results and your good guidance. I just want to go back to AI and the opportunity\nthere. Do you believe that PCs with AI chips will drive a major refresh cycle? And if so, when? Second half of next\nyear?\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nWilliam David Mosley A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nYeah. It's, Mark. I don't have a ton of visibility into that. Although I do talk to some of these customers that I grew\nup with about that exact topic. Look, I think that the PC space has been relatively slow to adopt new applications\nof late, and I think that's about to change. How quickly it will change is still anybody's guess. And of course, it's\nnot about specking new hardware. It's about specking new applications that had come. And most of those\napplications are, to your point, they're video applications.\nSo, yes, I do think that when you can enable creative professionals certainly to do – to create especially video, but\naudio counts as well and all kinds of other analytical tools that happen at the edge, you allow them to create much\nmore aggressively. I think they'll spin off more data. Some of that data will be serviced by the cloud service\nproviders they already are. And so, we see those applications growing, but some of that may be closer to the\nedge, and we're really excited about that. It's still very early. But I can't really predict where AI PCs are going to be\njust yet. But I think from what I'm seeing from application development, I'm excited about it, I think it is going to be\na driver in the near future.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMark Miller Q\nAnalyst, The Benchmark Co. LLC\nOkay. Just one other question. You mentioned there's a little idle capacity at the moment. What is the factory\nutilization in your head and media fabs? Are they 85% or higher?\n18\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSeagate Technology Holdings Plc\n(STX) Corrected Transcript\nQ1 2025 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nWilliam David Mosley A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nYeah, fairly high in both. I think we do have capacity as we transition to HAMR, we can – because we've\ndedicated a lot of that space to experiments, if you will, in the last few years. And so, now, some of that can\nbecome production instead of experimentation, but I think very high, over 90% utilization right now. And that's the\nway we want to keep it. We don't want to dip down because, as you know, that has a lot of cost implications back\ninto the business, and we want to make sure we maintain the staff running full.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMark Miller Q\nAnalyst, The Benchmark Co. LLC\nSo the greater 90% is both for head and media fabs, is that correct?\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nWilliam David Mosley A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nThat's right.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMark Miller Q\nAnalyst, The Benchmark Co. LLC\nThank you.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: And our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nKarl Ackerman Q\nAnalyst, BNP Paribas Securities Corp.\nYeah. Thank you. I was hoping you could discuss your build-to-order visibility and whether it's based on take-or-\npay contracts or if it would be better characterized as strong indications of interest, as you and customers plan\ntheir storage capacity additions over the coming quarters. And secondarily, if I may sneak in another one. I was\njust hoping you could also discuss the mix of SMR today, and perhaps going forward as we think about the mix of\nthese higher capacity products going into December and into 2025. Thank you.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nWilliam David Mosley A\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nYeah. Thanks, Karl. I'll let Gianluca do the build-to-order question. Just on the SMR, I say this many times, there's\nonly a couple of cloud customers that really take SMR. There's a couple client server customers that take SMR as\nwell, so we ship it into multiple markets. But we talk about SMR versus CMR, but I just look at it as drives, drives,\nhow does the customer need them, and we can configure them for those applications for those particular\ncustomers, whether it's one or two people accordingly. From my perspective, we have a great technology set that\nwe can deploy every place, and we'll try to keep those factories as full as we possibly can and maximize it. So\nthat's how I think about the SMR mix.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nGianluca Romano A\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Seagate Technology Holdings Plc\nOn the build to order, we have different kind of agreements with different customers, but the vast majority are\norders that are fully committed by customers out in time.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n19\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSeagate Technology Holdings Plc\n(STX) Corrected Transcript\nQ1 2025 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024\nKarl Ackerman Q\nAnalyst, BNP Paribas Securities Corp.\nThank you.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session.
