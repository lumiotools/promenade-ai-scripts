Martin business\nand a reduction in the number of Aevitas Solar projects completed in the year. Continuing\nOperations revenue declined 28% on a year-on-year constant AUD/USD FX basis.\n Gross profit^ declined to a ($2.3) million loss reflecting the impact of severe one-off weather events\non the Edenvale project, which incurred a $3.9 million loss. Excluding one off cost overruns, Gross\nProfit was $1.6 million.\n Adjusted EBITDA^ declined to a ($9.9) million loss due to the reduction in gross profit and loss on\nsale of J.A. Martin business only partially offset by reductions in General and Administrative\nexpenses. Adjusted EBITDA for continuing operations was ($5.7) million, a significantly narrower\nloss from ($9.1) million in the prior fiscal year.\n Statutory net after-tax loss^ of ($24.4) million for FY23 and loss per share (“EPS”) of ($0.99) per\nshare, as compared to a ($22.1) million loss and ($1.06) per share in FY22.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortisation, impairment of assets, impairment of goodwill, one-off non-recurring costs including restructuring expenses and non-cash\nequity remuneration. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted earnings per share provides investors and other users of our financial\ninformation consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations and\nfacilitates comparisons with our peer companies, many of which use similar non-IFRS or generally accepted accounting principles in the\nUnited States (“GAAP”) financial measure to supplement their IFRS or GAAP results, as applicable.\n2. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) is a non-IFRS financial measure. We define Adjusted EPS as net earnings less restructuring and non-\nrecurring costs, divided by the weighted average number of shares on issue during the period.\nPage | 4\nStrategic Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nChairman and Chief Executive’s Statement and Review\nThe financial year ended June 30, 2023 (“FY23”) was challenging. We delivered considerable progress on\nTembo operationally and commercially but at a group level we were adversely impacted by the negative\nconsequences of unexpected and prolonged adverse weather conditions and skills shortages in Australia,\nwhere the majority of our revenue, gross profit and earnings are currently generated. Both have now abated\nand we are looking at a much more promising Fiscal Year 2024 (“FY24”) with a resumption of growth expected\nacross all of our business units.\nKey achievements during the financial year included:\n• Tembo’s first version of the EUV23 conversion kit was available since December (material upgrade on\nprevious generation 28 kWh battery platform) and tested extensively.\n• Tembo increased order and commitment book by 160% from 5,000 kits to 13,000 kits (excluding MOUs)\nduring FY23:\n• In November 2022, the Company signed a definitive agreement with ETC Mauritius in Kenya for\nthe distribution of 4,000 conversion kits, which marked Tembo's largest agreement to date and\nits entry into the second hand light utility vehicle market.\n• In that same month, it signed a supply agreement with Evolution Group Holdings to convert their\nfleet of Toyota Hilux ICE vehicles in Australia and New Zealand to battery-electric, making\nEvolution the first traffic management company to commit to the conversion of its fleet to EVs.\n• In February, it signed a definitive agreement with Ulti-Mech in Australia to distribute 1,000\nconversion kits, adding to its geographic coverage the important Western Australia mining\nregion, a leading destination in the world for mining investment.\n• In June, it signed a definitive agreement with Fourche Maline, an engineering and technical\nservices company in Ghana, one of the largest mining countries in the world and the number one\ngold mining country in Africa, for 2,500 conversion kits.\n• An MOU was signed with Al Taif, the UAE’s leading provider of maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO)\nservices for military equipment and a subsidiary of EDGE Group, with the agreement spanning\ndistribution of conversion kits, R&D, training in electric mobility and high voltage, local assembly in the\nUAE.\n• Tembo upscaled its engineering team in the Netherlands, UK and Australia, doubling cumulative direct\nEV experience to over 100 years.\n• Strategic direct investment into Tembo was secured reflecting a $120m pre-money valuation.\n• Kenshaw’s focus on higher quality revenue through contracted maintenance services delivered good\nresults with multiyear contracts entered into with key data centre, mining and mining services clients.\n• Newly acquired AS/NZS3800 (Electrical equipment for explosive atmospheres) certification opened\nnew line of business for Kenshaw with strong pipeline of work expected to materially impact FY24\nresults.\nPost balance date, we were able to execute on the following:\n• Tembo entered into a definitive JV agreement with E-Francisco Motors (Francisco) to electrify the iconic\njeepneys of the Philippines. Francisco has a pipeline of 37,000 jeepneys for which Tembo will provide\nthe EV drivetrains.\n• On the Caret front, we have signed a term sheet with Backbone Digital, contributing 2 of our Texas solar\nprojects (totalling 96.5MW-DC) at a valuation of US$7.7m.\nPage | 5\nStrategic Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nAs mentioned before and notwithstanding the above achievements, VivoPower’s revenue and profits\ndeclined versus the prior financial year. Key financial results and metrics for the fiscal year ended 30 June\n2023 were as follows:\n• Annual group revenue from continuing operations declined 33% year-on-year (\"y-o-y\") to $15.1 million,\nprimarily due to fewer solar projects being executed at Aevitas Solar, with ongoing skills shortages in\nthe Australian electrical and building & construction industry causing difficulties in resourcing projects\nto meet demand, as well as a further decline in the Australian dollar versus the US dollar. Excluding the\neffect of movements in the AUD/USD exchange rate, annual group revenue from continuing operations\ndeclined by 28%.\n• Annual group gross loss from continuing operations decreased y-o-y to ($2.3) million from $0.3 million\ngross profit in Fiscal Year 2022 (\"FY22\") due to unseasonal wet weather conditions in Australia (as a\nresult of the La Niña weather phenomenon) which delayed works. The loss recognized during the period\nfor the Edenvale solar farm in Aevitas Solar amounted to $3.9 million. Excluding this one-off loss, group\ngross profit was $1.6 million.\n• Annual net after-tax loss from continuing operations of ($20.1) million and earnings per share (\"EPS\") of\n($0.82) per share, improved from a ($21.4) million loss and ($1.03) per share for FY22. Annual adjusted\nnet after-tax loss of ($14.2) million and adjusted EPS of ($0.58) per share narrowed from a ($19.1) million\nloss and ($0.92) per share respectively for FY22.\n• Annual underlying group adjusted EBITDA loss from continuing operations was ($5.7) million,\nrepresenting an improvement versus ($9.1) million EBITDA loss from continuing operations for FY22,\nreflecting lean management modus operandi.\nNotwithstanding the above, given the strong pipeline of contracted opportunities we have for both our\nElectric Vehicle and Critical Power Services business units, we are confident of the medium to long term\noutlook.\nFor the financial year ending 30 June 2024, we have set the following company objectives:\n• Deliver Tembo EV kits commitments on schedule and budget.\n• Continue R&D programme for Tembo and secure funding.\n• Expand Tembo addressable market & partnership base.\n• Grow Critical Power, expand capabilities & diversify customer base.\n• Grow SES business with new capabilities and partnerships.\n• Execute on corporate initiatives to enable sustainable growth.\nOn behalf of the rest of the Board, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our stakeholders for\ntheir continued support and engagement. I would also like to thank colleagues at VivoPower for their\nrelentless commitment to execution excellence. As a company, the VivoPower team remains focused on\nachieving its medium to long term strategic, financial and impact goals.\nKevin Chin\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\n27 November 2023\nPage | 6\nStrategic Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nStrategic Report\nPrincipal Activities\nVivoPower is an award-winning global sustainable energy solutions B Corporation company focused on\nelectric solutions for customised and ruggedised fleet applications, battery and microgrids, solar and critical\npower technology and services. The Company’s core purpose is to provide its customers with turnkey\ndecarbonisation solutions that enable them to move toward net-zero carbon status. VivoPower has\noperations and personnel in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States, the\nPhilippines, and the United Arab Emirates.\nManagement analyzes our business in five reportable segments: Critical Power Services, Electric Vehicles,\nSustainable Energy Solutions, Solar Development and Corporate Office.\nCritical Power Services is represented by VivoPower’s wholly owned-subsidiary Aevitas. In turn,\nAevitas wholly owns Kenshaw Electrical Pty Limited (“Kenshaw”) and Kenshaw Solar Pty Ltd\n(previously J.A. Martin) (“Aevitas Solar”), both of which operate in Australia with a focus on the\ndesign, supply, installation and maintenance of critical power, control and distribution systems,\nincluding for solar farms.\nElectric Vehicles is represented by Tembo e-LV B.V. (“Tembo Netherlands”) and Tembo EV Australia\nPty Ltd (“Tembo Australia”), (in combination “Tembo”) a specialist battery-electric and off-road\nvehicle company delivering electric vehicles (“EV”) for mining and other industrial customers\nglobally.\nSustainable Energy Solutions (“SES”) is the design, evaluation, sale and implementation of\nrenewable energy infrastructure to customers, both on a standalone basis and in support of Tembo\nEVs.\nSolar Development is represented by Caret and comprises seven active utility-scale solar projects\nunder development in the United States.\nCorporate Office is the Company’s corporate functions, including costs to maintain the Nasdaq\npublic company listing, comply with applicable SEC reporting requirements, and related investor\nrelations and is located in the U.K.\nSee Note 4.2 to our consolidated financial statements included herein for a breakdown of our financial\nresults by reportable segment while our key performance indicators are reported within the highlights at\nthe start of this report.\nCritical Power Services\nVivoPower, by way of a holding entity known as Aevitas, which was established in 2013 and subsequently\nacquired in December 2016, wholly owns two Australian subsidiaries: Kenshaw and Aevitas Solar. Aevitas is\na key player in the manufacture, distribution, installation and servicing of essential energy infrastructure\nsolutions. Its portfolio spans the design, procurement, installation, and upkeep of power and control\nsystems, including those catering to utility and industrial scale solar farms.\nAevitas’ reputation as reliable power consultants enables it to serve a diverse range of clients, spanning\ngovernmental, commercial, and industrial sectors. From their headquarters located in Newcastle, within\nNew South Wales' Hunter Valley region, these businesses extend their operations across Australia's Eastern\nseaboard with additional locations in Canberra and Sydney. Owing to their strategic positioning, they are\nwell-equipped to capitalize on the robust growth from public and private sector investments within the\ninfrastructure, renewable energy, mining, and data center industries.\nPage | 7\nStrategic Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nThe Hunter Valley region is Australia's foremost regional economy, larger than Tasmania, the Northern\nTerritory, and the Australian Capital Territory. With an estimated 322,000 jobs and a GDP valued at $28 billion,\nthe region has a diverse economic landscape and skilled workforce. Traditional strengths in mining and\nadvanced manufacturing, are being supplemented by rapidly expanding sectors such as defense, food and\nagribusiness, and renewables.\nThe region holds a favorable position to reap the benefits from overarching trends influencing the Australian\neconomy. Factors such as an aging population and increased integration into the global economy present\nsignificant opportunities for economic advancement and growth in the Hunter Valley.\nThe Critical Power Services businesses have several core competencies, encompassing a range of electrical\nand mechanical services. In addition, the businesses are responsible for delivering electrical services and\ninfrastructure to support VivoPower’s EV and SES offerings, including on-site renewable generation, batteries\nand microgrids, EV charging stations, and emergency backup power solutions.\nKenshaw Electrical Pty Limited\nEstablished in 1981, Kenshaw is a specialist in the provision of essential electrical and mechanical power\nservices, with its headquarters situated in Newcastle, within Australia's Hunter Valley region.\nKenshaw operates out of three locations across New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, with\nits head office in Newcastle and additional branches in Canberra and Sydney. The business’s longstanding\nhistory of quality is attributed to its highly skilled personnel, whose abilities span a comprehensive array of\ncritical power generation solutions, products, and services. Their expertise covers the entire life cycle of\nelectric motors, power generators, and mechanical equipment.\nKenshaw holds ISO9001 (Quality Management), ISO45001 (Occupational Health and Safety) and the newly\nacquired AS/NZS3800 (Electrical equipment for explosive atmospheres) certification as evidence of its\ncommitment to quality and safety. With a proactive and responsive approach, the business delivers\nprogrammed and as-needed services to a dedicated clientele that exceeds 500 in number. This diverse client\nbase spans local, national, and multinational entities, incorporating sectors from data centers and health\ninfrastructure to mine operators and agriculture. Furthermore, it serves aged care facilities, transport\nproviders, and utility services. Offering both contract-based and ad-hoc services, Kenshaw has built a strong\nreputation for reliable and timely service among its wide-ranging clientele.\nKenshaw’s core competencies include: generator design, turn-key sales and installation; generator servicing\nand emergency breakdown services; customized motor modifications; wheel cartridge motor electric repair\nand refurbishment; and industrial electrical services.\nThe data center sector remains an important market for Kenshaw. Propelled by the ongoing trend of digital\ntransformation, the rise and persistence of remote work, online education, and virtual entertainment amid\nand subsequent to the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for Kenshaw's services has seen significant growth. This\nsurge is further amplified by the burgeoning influence, processing and storage needs of artificial intelligence.\nVivoPower believes Kenshaw will continue to benefit from the growth in the data center market through its\nlong-term relationship with data center and facility management service providers. While Kenshaw has\ntraditionally been focused on new data center builds, this stage of the market is increasingly being\ndominated by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as Cummins and Penske, increasing\ncompetition and making margins unattractive. As a consequence, Kenshaw has pivoted to focus more\nheavily on data center maintenance services, both ad-hoc and scheduled. The nature of this revenue is of a\nhigher quality given it is at a higher margin, more predictable and in some cases, multiyear contracted.\nPage | 8\nStrategic Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nThe growing base of both Kenshaw and third party completed installation projects provides a fertile\nenvironment for the business to provide the ongoing monitoring and maintenance of these critical\nUninterruptible Power Supply (\"UPS\") assets, through its Generator Service division. The Canberra and\nSydney branches, form an integral part of this offering by allowing for locally stored equipment and locally\navailable personnel with an aim for Kenshaw to become entrenched at its clients’ sites for the entire lifecycle\nof these assets.\nIn addition to the data center sector, the infrastructure sector continues to be a growing contributor for\nKenshaw. In the 2022-23 budget season, a record $168 billion in general government expenditure was\nallocated to infrastructure over the four years to FY2025-26. This is $4.5 billion higher than the 2021-22 budget\nseason. Of particular relevance to Kenshaw, the New South Wales state government allocated $58 billion to\ninfrastructure, an increase of $1.8 billion over the prior year, and equivalent to 17.9% of general government\nexpenditure.\nA key part of the infrastructure sector and where Kenshaw has enjoyed good growth is the rail sector.\nAustralian railways activity across construction and maintenance rose to a record $8.5 billion in 2021-22, with\nactivity forecast to average $9.5 billion over the next five years as a swathe of large and predominantly\npublicly funded projects ramp up across Australia. Railway construction work increased in real terms by 2.9%\nto $7 billion in 2021-22, a record level of activity. This represents the sixth consecutive year of growth in rail\nconstruction driven predominantly by publicly funded projects, which have increased by 287% since 2014-\n15. Overall, $85 billion in rail civil construction and maintenance is forecast for the coming decade to 2031-\n32, compared to $63 billion over the last decade. Over the next 15 years, $101 billion in rail construction work\nis expected.\nKenshaw benefits from the continued increase in public sector spending on infrastructure, and in particular\nrail projects, through the provision of custom critical power backup solutions and generator maintenance to\nclients such as civil construction contractors, government agencies and government departments.\nKenshaw's traditional clientele also extends to entities operating within or servicing Australia's mining\nsector—the nation's predominant industry as gauged by GDP contribution. Over the past year, the Australian\nmining sector has maintained strong performance, fortifying Kenshaw's position in the industry.\nFurthermore, with the mining sector's increasing commitment towards sustainability and acceleration\ntowards achieving net-zero objectives, mine site electrification, particularly with renewable energy, emerges\nas a significant growth opportunity for both Kenshaw and VivoPower. Given Kenshaw's established track\nrecord in the sector, it is optimally poised to capitalize on future expansion in the Australian mining industry,\nparticularly in its pursuit of decarbonization.\nRevenue earned within Australia is comprised of the following activities:\nYear Ended 30 June\n(US dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nGenerator sales and installation 2,159 5,206 11,479\nGenerator service and non-\n2,372 1,767 1,761\ndestructive testing\nMotor sales and overhaul 6,474 5,315 5,169\nTotal revenue 11,005 12,288 18,409\nThere is no material seasonality which impacts Kenshaw, however in FY2023, the business continued to be\nadversely impacted by supply chain challenges, with most electrical equipment manufactured outside of\nAustralia. The business has had to adapt to longer lead times from suppliers caused by the COVID-19 induced\ndisruption to supply chains and crisis in Ukraine. In addition, inflationary impact has seen an increase in cost\nof goods sold, the majority of which has been passed on to clients.\nPage | 9\nStrategic Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nRelationships with its primary suppliers enables Kenshaw to sell and service their equipment as a dealer or\nagent. The business is a primary supplier and service agent for Cummins, Deutz and CAT generators, and\nWEG electric motors, and maintains long-term relationships with other equipment manufacturers such as\nSiemens, Toshiba and Teco. This allows Kenshaw to offer a complete solution to its clients with flexibility of\nproduct choice.\nWith almost 500 active customers for the year ended June 30, 2023, the business is not solely reliant on one\ncustomer, nor is the business reliant on any one patent, license, material contract, or process. Further, there\nare no government regulations which are material to the business, beyond those generally applicable to all\nbusinesses within the same statutory regime.\nVivoPower continues to believe that Kenshaw, through its experience, capability, and track record, is well\npositioned competitively to benefit from the strong growth outlook for Australian data centers, aged and\nhealth care infrastructure as well as the continued strength of the Australian mining sector, particularly as it\ntransitions towards decarbonization.\nAevitas Solar\nAligning with VivoPower's strategic vision to concentrate on its primary businesses - electrical vehicle,\nrenewable critical power, and sustainable energy solutions - the non-solar segment of J.A. Martin was\nidentified as non-essential. As a result, it was divested to ARA on July 1, 2022. Subsequently, the solar-focused\ndivision of J.A. Martin has been rebranded as Aevitas Solar and is now overseen by the Kenshaw leadership\nteam.\nAevitas Solar remains committed to fulfilling existing contracts established prior to the divestiture, such as\nthose related to the Blue Grass and Edenvale Solar Farms. Concurrently, the company actively explores new\nventures in the solar sector as part of the Aevitas Solar expansion strategy. However, it maintains a prudent\napproach, being keenly aware of the inherent risks tied to such projects.\nResults of J.A. Martin's non-solar activities have been classified under discontinued operations. Included in\nthe net assets divested to ARA of the discontinued operation is a Newcastle-based facility, which specializes\nin manufacturing industrial switchboards and motor control centers. Additionally, this facility oversees end-\nto-end project installations, provides maintenance services, and offers both design and engineering\nexpertise. Complementing this is an office and workshop facility situated in the Hunter Valley, dedicated to\nserving the mining and industrial sectors.\nDespite its longstanding history and focus on the industrial, manufacturing, and mining sectors, Aevitas Solar\nhas, in the past four years, carved out a commendable reputation and standing within the Australian solar\nmarket. In the recent fiscal year, Aevitas Solar marked significant milestones by finalizing the electrical\ninstallations and services for both its ninth and tenth solar farms, the 200MWdc Blue Grass Solar Farm and\nthe 204MWdc Edenvale Solar Farm.\nRevenue earned within Australia of continuing operations is comprised of the following activities:\nYear Ended 30 June\n(US dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nElectrical installation projects 2,591 8,671 4,172\nTotal revenue 2,591 8,671 4,172\nAevitas Solar’s solar division continued to be materially affected by high levels of rainfall along the east coast\nof Australia in the second half of 2022, continuing into 2023. Nationally-averaged rainfall was 26% above the\n1961–1990 average at 587.8 mm, which made 2022 the ninth-wettest year on record for Australia. In eastern\nAustralia in particular, persistent rain saw significant flooding affecting large areas multiple times during the\nPage | 10\nStrategic Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nyear, including Aevitas Solar project locations. As a consequence, the occurrence of delays attributable to\nadverse weather have risen, resulting in delayed project completions and higher costs due to the fixed price,\nlow margin nature, and disproportionate and unfavorable risk allocation contained within contracts in the\nindustry.\nGiven the structural nature of these risks and the likely ongoing effects of climate change, Aevitas Solar is\ntargeting opportunities with more favorable risk allocation and higher margins. These tend to be smaller,\nindustrial projects that are behind-the-meter but where Aevitas Solar can leverage its experience and skills,\nwithout taking on burdensome contractual terms and working capital requirements.\nAevitas Solar selects its materials from an expansive network of both domestic and international suppliers.\nThe criteria for this selection hinge on competitive pricing, timely delivery, product efficacy, and established\nbusiness relations. These supplier relationships stand central to Aevitas Solar's ability to achieve its\ncommercial objectives and its capacity to satisfy customer demands in a competitive environment.\nGiven that a majority of electrical equipment is manufactured overseas, the company has adjusted to\nextended supplier lead times. This is primarily a result of supply chain disruptions instigated by the COVID-\n19 pandemic and, more recently, the conflict in Ukraine. Despite these adaptations, the challenges in the\nsupply chain have not been entirely alleviated and continue to present operational hurdles.\nWith the sale of the non-solar J.A. Martin operations, Aevitas Solar will need to diversify its customer-base in\norder to reduce its reliance on its key solar partner, Grupo Gransolar, S.L. The business is not dependent on\nany one patent, license, material contract, or process. Further, there are no government regulations which\nare material to the business, beyond those generally applicable to all businesses within the same statutory\nregime.\nElectric Vehicles\nTembo e-LV B.V. (\"Tembo\"), with subsidiaries Tembo 4x4 e-LV B.V. and FD 4x4 Centre B.V. (“Tembo\nNetherlands”), as well as Tembo Technologies Pty Ltd (“Tembo Australia”) are specialist battery-electric and\noff-road vehicle companies that design and build electric battery conversion kits to replace internal\ncombustion engines (“ICE”) in light utility vehicle fleets. Tembo customers are located across the globe and\nare mainly in the mining, infrastructure, government services, humanitarian, tourism, agriculture and utilities\nsectors. At present, Tembo is focused on completing the testing of its new generation LandCruiser LC70 EUV\nconversion kits (\"EUV23\") and preparing to commence production later in the year. It is anticipated that\nTembo will start shipping these new generation LandCruiser conversion kits late in the second half of\ncalendar year 2023.\nWith a secular trend of increasing Electric Vehicle (\"EV\") adoption globally by consumers and continuing\npressure from governments and investors for companies to implement concrete decarbonization measures,\nVivoPower believes that Tembo is well placed to satisfy fleet owners' demand for its conversion kits, which\nare aimed at sectors with stringent requirements on reliability and safety.\nOrder book pipeline, deliveries and key agreements\nDuring FY2023, Tembo successfully negotiated several large distribution agreements with partners around\nthe globe. In August 2022, VivoPower entered into memorandum of understanding with a State-Owned\nEnterprise for 1,000 conversion kits in Jordan, which aligns with Tembo’s strategy to expand its commercial\nactivities and operations in the Middle East, one of the largest market for LandCruisers in the world. In\nNovember 2022, the Company signed a definitive agreement with ETC Mauritius in Kenya for the distribution\nof 4,000 conversion kits, which marked Tembo’s largest agreement to date and its entry into the second-\nhand light utility vehicle market. In that same month, it signed a supply agreement with Evolution Group\nHoldings to convert their fleet of Toyota Hilux ICE vehicles in Australia and New Zealand to battery-electric,\nmaking Evolution the first traffic management company to commit to the conversion of its fleet to EVs. In\nFebruary, it signed a definitive agreement with Ulti-Mech in Australia to distribute 1,000 conversion kits,\nPage | 11\nStrategic Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nadding to its geographic coverage the important Western Australia mining region, a leading destination in\nthe world for mining investment. In March, it signed a memorandum of understanding with Petrosea, a key\nsupplier to the mining and oil & gas sectors in Indonesia, to distribute 2,000 conversion kits. In June, it signed\na definitive agreement with Fourche Maline, an engineering and technical services company in Ghana, one\nof the largest mining countries in the world and the number one gold mining country in Africa, for 2,500\nconversion kits.\nAlso in June, Tembo signed a memorandum of understanding with Al Taif to form a partnership spanning\ndistribution of Tembo EUV conversion kits, research & development, training in electric mobility and high\nvoltage, as well as local assembly operations in the UAE. AL TAIF is a subsidiary of the EDGE Group, one of\nthe world’s leading advanced technology groups, established to develop disruptive solutions for defence\nand beyond. Its customers include defence and police organizations in the UAE, the Middle East and\nNorthern Africa (\"MENA\") region and extending to other regions.\nWith regard to orders, in January, Tembo hosted Acces, its distribution partner in Canada, to test drive the\nnewest version of Tembo's converted LandCruiser 70 Series pickup truck in Italy. Acces subsequently placed\nan initial order for a large proportion of Tembo’s scheduled 2023 production, which are scheduled for\ndelivery in the final quarter of 2023. Customer deliveries of ruggedised electric vehicles were executed for\nexisting partners, including for GHH in South Africa and Jankel in the U.K in March.\nTembo continued to invest in marketing for its EUV23 kit, organizing drive days in the UAE and in Brisbane\nto showcase its electric LandCruiser to potential customers and partners, which resulted in new business\nopportunities actively pursued by Tembo's management. Tembo was also selected to showcase its\ntechnology and know-how by large companies in the mining and utilities sectors, for example in the case of\nthe Future Forum organized by Endeavour Energy, the operator of the electrical distribution network for\nGreater Western Sydney, the Blue Mountains, the Southern Highlands and the Illawarra region of New South\nWales.\nNon EV operations in FD 4x4 for vehicle spec conversion including ruggedization of ICE vehicles comprised\nprimarily an order to ruggedize 15 vehicles from Boliden in Ireland, delivered in December 2022. The order\nwas not completely fulfilled due to the lack of availability of certain parts.\nPost June 30 2023, Tembo signed a landmark joint venture agreement with Francisco Motors, the pioneering\nmanufacturer of jeepneys in the Philippines. Under the agreement, Tembo will develop and supply EUV\nelectrification kits for a new generation of electric jeepneys. One of the country’s cultural icons, jeepneys are\nthe most common utility vehicle in the Philippines and the main mode of public transportation, accounting\nfor just over 40% of public transportation in the country. There are more than 200,000 jeepneys on the road\nin the Philippines, of which more than 90% are at least 15 years old and running on second-hand diesel\nengines. Under the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program, the Philippine Government requires that\nall jeepneys and other public utility vehicles with at least 15 years of service be replaced with Euro 4-\ncompliant or electric-powered vehicles. This creates a US$10bn+ addressable market for the replacement of\nthe old jeepneys. Francisco Motors and Tembo have already secured their first orders and have commenced\nwork to deliver on those orders. The agreement will also give Tembo access to low-cost assembly in the\nPhilippines.\nInvestment\nIn June, VivoPower announced a strategic direct equity investment into Tembo at a pre-money valuation of\n$120 million. Tembo secured an initial investment commitment of $2.5 million from a private investment\noffice backed by a member of the ruling Al Maktoum family of Dubai. The investor, under the agreement\nterms, retains the option to increase its cumulative investment in subsequent closings, up to $10 million.\nThis investment underscores Tembo's progress and commitment to the UAE and surrounding markets.\nPage | 12\nStrategic Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nVehicle quality, reliability, certification and safety\nIn mid-December 2022, Tembo released the first version of its new generation EUV conversion kit fully\nintegrated into a vehicle, the EUV23. This vehicle was undergoing extensive testing and validation\nthroughout the second half of FY2023. Additional pilot vehicles in various configurations, i.e. 2-door and 4-\ndoor plus left hand and right-hand were also being built and readied for testing in this period. The EUV23 has\na 250 newton-meter torque electric drive train, providing up to 200 kilometres of range and is managed by\nTembo’s purpose-built software control systems. In January, Tembo and Toyota Motor Corporation\nAustralia Limited concluded the Design Services Agreement with Toyota Australia for the electrified\nLandCruiser 70 Series.\nIn planning for its next stage of growth, Tembo has implemented systems, procedures, and policies to\nunderpin a smooth and seamless execution from the time it engages with a prospect through to the on-going\nsupport as required by customers as they replace ICE vehicles in their fleets. As part of this, industry-grade,\nscalable, cloud-based software was implemented in various processes to ensure reliability and continuity of\nservice.\nIn the third quarter of FY2023, Tembo underwent an annual ISO recertification audit for its ISO9001 (Quality\nManagement System) and ISO14001 (Environmental Management System) certifications. Both audits were\nsuccessfully passed. Additionally, Tembo started two new ISO certification journeys: ISO45001 for\nOccupational Health & Safety and ISO27001 for Information Security. These additional certifications will add\nsignificantly to the overall safety and security of its staff as well as the data held on staff, customers and\nsuppliers. Tembo has also completed its internal assessment in support of its B Corp Certification\napplication and is continuing work on reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, for example by\noptimising its supply chain for proximity to assembly and packing facilities. Tembo expects to obtain its B\nCorp Certification in the second half of FY2024 if B Lab's independent audit is successfully passed.\nTembo’s electric vehicles achieved a significant quality and reliability milestone with its longest-serving\nelectric LandCruiser, which crossed the 5-year mark of active service with an uninterrupted safety record at\nan operating mine site owned by Boliden in the first quarter of calendar year 2023. Tembo believes this to be\nthe longest actively serving electrified light utility vehicle in the mining industry globally.\nIn preparation for the official production launch of its battery electric EUV23 conversion kits, Tembo\nlaunched Tembo Academy which is aimed at ensuring that its partners and customers are adequately\ntrained on all aspects of onboarding an electric battery vehicle fleets, covering operation, maintenance as\nwell as Health & Safety. Tembo set up a cross-functional project team, combining members of its engineering\nand safety teams and advisory council, in order to deliver carefully structured and practical course materials.\nAn introductory training course was held in Eindhoven in October 2022 with its global partner GHH, who sent\ntechnical staff from India and Germany with positive feedback from course attendees.\nTalent pool and hiring\nThroughout FY2023, Tembo continued to hire despite retrenchments in other parts of the industry, taking\nadvantage of experienced talent available on the market. Tembo selectively recruited high-quality talent in\nthe Netherlands and the United Kingdom and invested in Engineering, Procurement, Quality and Testing. It\ncontinued to be open to hiring experienced talent in its key markets.\nTembo assembled a team of EV and OEM industry leaders, several of them pioneers in their field, to advise\non various aspects of its scale-up journey. Their input has already proven tactically invaluable for Tembo and\nwill be leveraged tangibly in FY2024 for the production scale-up phase.\nVivoPower appointed Eduardo Nebot as a new member of the VivoPower Advisory Council. Based in Sydney,\nEduardo is currently an Emeritus Professor at the University of Sydney and a consultant on autonomous\nsystems for various industries, including transport and mining automation. He is a pioneer in the research,\ndevelopment, and deployment of autonomous systems and safety and has worked with both private\nPage | 13\nStrategic Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\ncompanies and government organizations in Australia and internationally. Another key recruitment was\nChoon Lim as Senior Engineering Director. Having worked for Bosch, Tesla and Rivian, he has considerable\nexperience in developing safety critical control systems, self-driving cars and electric cars. In his most recent\nrole as a Senior Director he has been responsible for a significant portion of the firmware at Rivian. He led\nteams for System Engineering, Software Functional Safety, System Architecture, Integration Testing and\nControls Algorithms for the domains of Propulsion, Chassis Controls, Suspension Controls, Body Controls\nand Over The Air Updating.\nRevenue earned within the Netherlands is comprised of the following activities:\nYear Ended 30 June\n(US dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nConversion kits - 789 137\nVehicle spec conversion 1,394 301 1,219\nAccessories 70 400 38\nTotal revenue 1,464 1.490 1,394\nNo EUV conversion kits were sold in FY2023, although orders were received (reflected in deferred revenue),\nwhilst the development programme testing continued, nevertheless, vehicle spec conversions for non EV\nvariants increased from $0.3 million in the prior year to $1.4 million in FY2023, primarily as a result of Boliden\norders.\nSustainable Energy Solutions (“SES”)\nAugmenting its Electric Vehicle business, which deploys EUV conversion products and services to fleet\nowners, VivoPower is also focused on an SES strategy with its core mission being to help corporate\ncustomers achieve their decarbonization goals. The SES business delivers full-suite, holistic SES to industrial\ncustomers and other large energy users and is comprised of four key elements:\n● Critical power “electric-retrofit” of customer’s sites to enable optimised EV battery charging,\nencompassing charging stations, renewables, battery storage and microgrids;\n● EV and battery leasing;\n● EV battery reuse and recycling; and\n● Change management services\nIn Australia, the SES business draws on the experience and capabilities of VivoPower’s Australian Critical\nPower Services businesses (Kenshaw Electrical and Aevitas Solar) to deliver solutions to customers directly,\nwhilst in other markets, it partners with experienced local critical power services and charging infrastructure\ncompanies.\nSince its establishment in FY2021, the SES business has signed several key agreements to complete its\noffering. In December 2021, VivoPower executed a Memorandum of Understanding signed with Relectrify, a\nleading supplier of battery energy storage systems utilizing second-life EV batteries, with the collaboration\nextended to explore future redeployment of Tembo batteries. In August 2022 the Company invested in Green\nGravity Energy Pty Ltd, an Australian company specializing in energy storage solutions in former mining\nlocations. In May 2023, VivoPower signed a definitive partnership agreement for VivoPower to market and\ndistribute Vital EV Solutions (“Vital EV”) fleet charging solutions globally. Vital EV is a specialist U.K-\nheadquartered company, offering a comprehensive range of electric vehicle charging solutions for fleet\nowners and is the official re-seller of Kempower charging stations and service solutions in the U.K and across\nAfrica. Kempower, headquartered in Finland, has high-speed EV fleet charging solutions including for off-\nPage | 14\nStrategic Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nhighway working environment applications. Under the Agreement, VivoPower will be able to offer to its\ncustomers and partners a wide range of EV fleet charging products and services from Vital EV and Kempower\nfor an initial term of 3 years. These products include multi-voltage lightweight movable rapid chargers, hub-\nand-spoke rapid and ultra-rapid charging systems, satellite dispensers as well as conventional station\nchargers.\nGiven that the SES business segment was established in FY2021, it has generated minimal revenues to date.\nVivoPower is actively working to originate new SES projects for both new and existing customers of the\nVivoPower group of companies, with significant projects already proposed to major mining and utilities\ncompanies. The impending release of Tembo's EUV23 conversion kits later in the 2023 calendar year\nprovides a strong impetus for customers to proceed with the electrification of their light vehicle fleet and, in\ntandem, implement the correct charging infrastructure, which will require the whole suite of SES offerings\ndepending on customer site infrastructure readiness. The Company therefore expects significant growth\nfrom this segment going forward.\nSolar Development\nHistoric Solar Development Business\nAs a consequence of the Company’s strategic pivot to an SES strategy in FY2021, VivoPower no longer intends\nto engage in solar project development activities in isolation, unless it is a component of a sustainable\nenergy solution for a corporate customer that is helping it to achieve decarbonization goals. This segment\nhas historically been characterized as the Solar Development segment and encompassed the Company’s\nsolar development activities in the U.S. and Australia. The Company no longer has solar development\nactivities in Australia following the sale of its interests in solar farm projects in the country in FY2021.\nVivoPower’s historic strategy in relation to solar development has been to minimize capital intensity and\nmaximize return on invested capital by pursuing a business model predicated on developing and selling\nprojects prior to construction and continually recycling capital rather than owning assets. The stages of solar\ndevelopment can be broadly characterized as: (i) early stage; (ii) mid-stage; (iii) advanced stage; (iv)\nconstruction; and (v) operation. Our business model has been to work through the development process\nfrom early stage through to advanced stage, and then sell those projects that have completed the advanced\nstage of development, also known as “shovel-ready” projects, to investors who will finance construction and\nultimately own and operate the project.\nSuccessful solar development requires an experienced team that can manage multiple work streams on a\nparallel path, from initially identifying attractive locations, to land control, permitting, interconnection,\npower marketing, and project sale to investors. Rather than build a substantial team internally to accomplish\nall of these activities, our business model has been to joint venture on a non-exclusive basis with existing\nexperienced project development teams so that multiple projects can be advanced simultaneously and\nallow us to focus on provision of capital, project management, and marketing and sale of projects. In\nAustralia we partnered with ITP Renewables (“ITP”), a global leader in renewable energy engineering,\nstrategy and construction, and energy sector analytics. In the U.S., we entered into a development joint\nventure with ISS in April 2017 and in June 2021, VivoPower announced that it had secured full ownership of\nthe remaining 50% of the equity interest in the portfolio from ISS for a nominal consideration of $1.\nUnited States Solar Development\nVivopower's focus for its solar business remains to monetise its portfolio of US solar projects, with the aim of\nusing the funds generated to advance the Company's SES strategy.\nIn July 2021 VivoPower announced that it had gained full ownership of the equity interest in the solar\nportfolio which was previously owned by an affiliate of ISS. Shortly thereafter, the Company effected the\nname change of the subsidiary from Innovative Solar Ventures I, LLC to Caret LLC.\nPage | 15\nStrategic Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nThe Company’s portfolio of U.S. solar projects is held by its wholly owned subsidiary, Caret. Caret owns a\nsolar project portfolio comprising 38 projects in total, of which 7 projects totalling 365 MW-DC are being\nactively developed, and a further 31 projects totalling approximately 1,479 MW-DC, have either been\npreviously discontinued or are not currently being developed.\nThe actively developed projects are dispersed throughout Texas and are strategically situated in regions with\nminimal solar power penetration. Each of these projects has reached an advanced phase of development,\nwith substantial interconnection studies and environmental evaluations completed, and the required land\nsecured for a duration of up to 40 years. Despite the strides made in executing our Power-to-X strategy and\nthe passing of the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022, which heightened investor confidence in the US\nsolar power sector, all these projects are still carried at cost.\nThe Company is assessing the viability of Power-to-X development possibilities with both active and\ndiscontinued projects collaborating with data infrastructure developers who intend to place their data\ncentres in proximity to solar farms integrated “behind-the-meter”. Solar energy's power generation pattern\naligns with ERCOT's spot electricity cost curve, which allows operators at the load site to curb peak hour rate\nsurges.\nThe company envisages that any income generated from the monetization of its US solar projects, inclusive\nof those related to Power-to-X developments, will be channelled to bolster its primary SES strategy.\nPage | 16\nStrategic Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nThe Company does not intend to acquire any additional utility-scale solar projects in the United States at\nthis time and is focused on maximizing value from its current portfolio of projects.\nJOBS Act\nBased on the market capitalisation of the Company as at June 30, 2023, the Company meets the requirement\nfor being a smaller reporting company and non-accelerated filer and is therefore exempt from an auditor\nattestation of internal control under SOX 404(b).\nIn previous reporting periods, the Company met the requirements under the JOBS Act as an “emerging\ngrowth company” to (i) not provide an auditor’s attestation report on its system of internal controls over\nfinancial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) provide all of the compensation\ndisclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the\nPCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional\ninformation about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis), or (iv) disclose\ncertain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and\nperformance and comparisons of our chief executive officer’s compensation to median employee\ncompensation.\nFinancial Results\nYear Ended 30 June\n2023 2022 (restated)\n(US dollars in thousands) Continuing Discontinued Total Continuing Discontinued Total\nRevenue from contracts\n15,060 - 15,060 22,448 15,168 37,616\nwith customers\nCosts of sales (13,472) - (13,472) (20,308) (13,842) (34,150)\nCost of sales – non-recurring\n(3,850) - (3,850) (1,881) - (1,881)\nevents\nGross profit (2,262) - (2,262) 259 1,326 1,585\nGeneral and administrative\n(7,620) - (7,620) (13,811) (1,485) (15,296)\nexpenses\nOther Gains/(losses) 30 (4,207) (4,177) (13) - (13)\nOther income 119 - 119 662 324 986\nDepreciation of property\n(750) - (750) (770) (445) (1,215)\nand equipment\nAmortisation of intangible\n(831) - (831) (850) (322) (1,172)\nassets\nOperating loss (11,314) (4,207) (15,521) (14,523) (602) (15,125)\nRestructuring and other\n(2,084) - (2,084) (443) - (443)\nnon-recurring costs\nFinance income 1,156 - 1,156 173 2 175\nFinance expense (7,366) - (7,366) (8,604) (174) (8,778)\nLoss before income tax (19,608) (4,207) (23,815) (23,397) (774) (24,171)\nIncome tax (540) - (540) 1,968 149 2,117\nLoss for the year (20,148) (4,207) (24,355) (21,429) (625) (22,054)\nAdjusted EBITDA (5,735) (4,207) (9,942) (9,122) 166 (8,956)\nPage | 17\nStrategic Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nManagement analyzes our business in five reportable segments: Critical Power Services, Electric Vehicles,\nSustainable Energy Solutions, Solar Development, and Corporate Office.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2023, the Group (including discontinued operations) generated total revenue\nof $15.1 million, gross loss of $2.3 million, operating loss of $15.3 million and a net loss of $22.4 million.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment of\nassets, impairment of goodwill, other finance income and expenses, one-off non-recurring costs including\nrestructuring expenses and non-cash equity remuneration.\nThe results for the year ended June 30, 2023 reflect a reduction in the number of Aevitas Solar projects\ncompleted in the year and the impact of severe one-off weather events on the Edenvale project, which\nincurred a $3.9 million loss.\nRevenue in Critical Power Services (excluding discontinued operations) declined by $7.4 million to $13.6\nmillion in the year, impacted by $6 million from a reduction in the number of solar projects undertaken by\nAevitas Solar. Kenshaw, which expanded into an additional facility in Newcastle, New South Wales due to\nincreasing demand, saw revenues flat compared to the previous year on a constant AUD to USD exchange\nrate, with an increase in higher margin sales in generator service and motor sales and overhaul, offset by a\nreduction in generator sales and installation due to competitive market conditions and constrained supply\nchain. Electric Vehicles contributed $1.5 million revenue in the year, predominantly from non-EV\nruggedization conversions, whilst EV activity is focused entirely on product development. There was no\nrevenue contribution from Solar Development or Sustainable Energy Solutions in the year ended June 30,\n2023 (year ended June 30, 2022: nil).\nGross profit (including discontinued operations) decreased by $3.8 million to a loss of $2.3 million, although\non a continuing basis excluding J.A. Martin ex-Solar operations, gross profit decreased by $2.5 million to a\nloss of $2.3 million. In percentage terms, gross margin from continuing operations fell from 1% to (14%),\nlargely driven by one-off extreme weather events impact on Aevitas Solar projects in FY2023, having a more\nsignificant impact than COVID-19 lockdowns and impact on supply chain in the prior year. Gross loss in\nFY2023 includes $3.9 million specific costs of non-recurring extreme weather events on Edenvale project for\nAevitas Solar. In the prior year, $1.9 million of non-recurring costs on the Blue Grass project were also\nincurred in Aevitas Solar, due to state border closures during the project execution phase. Excluding these\nnon-recurring costs, gross margin for continuing operations increased from 9.5% in the prior year, to 10.5%\nin FY2023, reflecting increased focus on high margin service revenues in Kenshaw. Electric Vehicles\ncontributed nil gross profit (prior year: nil) while Solar Development contributed nil (prior year: nil).\nThe gain on Solar Development projects from continuing operations was net nil for the year ended June 30,\n2023. Included within discontinued operations was a $4.2 million loss on disposal of J.A. Martin ex-solar\noperations in July 2022. Compared to the book value of assets less liabilities held for sale as at June 30, 2023,\nthe loss results primarily from a reduction in the contingent consideration payable based on the earn out fee\ncalculated as a multiple of the post disposal earnings of J.A. Martin ex-solar in FY2023.\nPage | 18\nStrategic Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nOther gains/(losses) were nil for the year ended June 30, 2023. This compares to a nil gain in the year ended\nJune 30, 2022, comprising a $0.1 million write-off of costs incurred on uneconomic projects in Caret, offset\nby $0.1 million gain on sale of tangible assets in Critical Power Systems.\nThe results for the year ended June 30, 2023, also reflect a restated $6.2 million decrease in general and\nadministrative costs related to continuing operations to $7.6 million. The decrease includes a $1.1 million\ndecrease in marketing expenses, a $1.7 million decrease in non-cash equity remuneration, and a $3.6 million\ndecrease in salaries and other overheads from reduction in Tembo and Aevitas executive management and\nadministrative team.\nThe results of operations for the year ended June 30, 2023, include $2.1 million restructuring and other non-\nrecurring costs primarily due a provision in respect of fiscal refunds on prior receivables, which the Company\nis defending.\nNet finance costs from continuing operations of $6.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2023, include $3.8\nmillion interest on related party loans, $1.6 million net foreign exchange losses and $0.8 million combined\ncosts from dividends from Aevitas Preference Shares, interest on leases and interest on other debt.\nAs at June 30, 2023, the Group’s current assets were $10.3 million (as at June 30, 2022: $21.7 million restated;\nJune 30, 2021: $24.5 million restated), representing a decrease from June 30, 2022, mostly due to the disposal\nof assets held for sale relating to the J.A. Martin ex-solar segment (as at June 30, 2022: $8.2 million) upon the\nsale of the business to ARA in July 2022. Current assets were comprised of $0.6 million of cash and cash\nequivalents (as at June 30, 2022: $1.3 million; June 30, 2021: $8.6 million), $0.6 million of restricted cash (as\nat June 30, 2022: $1.2 million; June 30, 2021: $1.1 million;), and $7.0 million of trade and other receivables (as\nat June 30, 2022: $9.1 million; June 30, 2021: $12.8 million), and $2.1m of inventory (as at June 30, 2022: $1.9\nmillion; June 30, 2021: $2.0 million). 30 June 2022 and 30 June 2021 current assets were restated for a $0.5m\nreclassification from Intangible Assets to Deposits.\nCurrent liabilities were $18.9 million as at June 30, 2023 (as at June 30, 2022, $23.3 million restated; June 30,\n2021: $13.4 million). The decrease from prior year reflects negotiation of shareholder loans and accrued\ninterest to non-current terms, and disposal of liabilities held for sale (as at June 30, 2022, $1.5 million)\nfollowing sale of J.A. Martin ex-solar to ARA in July 2022. 30 June 2022 current liabilities were restated for an\naccrual of $0.5m expenses relating to 2022 but incurred in 2023.\nCurrent asset-to-liability ratio as at June 30, 2023 was 0.54:1 (as at June 30, 2022 restated: 0.93:1; June 30,\n2021 restated: 1.82:1).\nAs at June 30, 2023, the Company had net assets of $3.7 million (as at June 30, 2022 restated, $21.6 million;\nJune 30, 2021: $40.4 million), including intangible assets of $42.2 million (as at June 30, 2022 restated: $39.6\nmillion; June 30, 2021 restated: $47 million). Property, plant and equipment remained at $3.7 million as at\nJune 30, 2023 (as at June 30, 2022, $3.7 million), mainly reflecting $0.6 million capital expenditure on plant\nand equipment, an additional leased property in Kenshaw, offset by depreciation charges. 30 June 2022 and\n30 June 2021 were restated for a $0.5m reclassification from Intangible Assets to Deposits.\nCash outflow for the year ended June 30, 2023, was $0.7 million, arising from cash outflows from operating\nactivities of $8.6 million and from cash used in investing activities of $1.9 million partially offset by cash inflow\nfrom financing activities of $9.8 million. At June 30, 2023, the Company had cash reserves of $0.6 million\n(June 30, 2022: $1.3 million) and debt of $32.4 million (June 30, 2022: $28.6 million), giving a net debt position\nof $31.8 million (June 30, 2022: $27.3 million).\nNet cash outflows from investing activities of $1.9 million in the current year comprised $1.0 million net\npurchases of property, plant and equipment and $3.9 million investment in additional intangible assets\npertaining to the EUV23 development project in Tembo, offset by the $2.9 million proceeds from the J.A\nMartin sale.\nPage | 19\nStrategic Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nCash inflows from financing activities of $9.8 million in the year ended June 30, 2023 comprises $5.1 million\nnet proceeds from the Nasdaq shelf raise in July 2022 and $3.6 million bridging loans from related party AWN,\n$1.3 million additional debtor financing, less $0.9 million repayments of related party and other borrowings\npaid.\nPage | 20\nStrategic Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nYear Ended 30 June 2023 Compared to Year Ended 30 June 2022:\nDiscontinued\nContinuing operations\noperations\nCritical Sustainable Critical\nYear Ended 30 June 2023 Power Solar Electric Energy Corporate Total Power\n(US dollars in thousands) Services Development Vehicles Solutions Office Continuing Services Total\nRevenue from contracts with customers 13,596 - 1,464 - - 15,060 - 15,060\nCosts of sales – other (11,900) - (1,572) - - (13,472) - (13,472)\nCost of sales – non-recurring events (3,850) - - - - (3,850) - (3,850)\nGross profit (2,154) - (108) - - (2,262) - (2,262)\nGeneral and administrative expenses (1,390) (297) (1,005) (367) (4,561) (7,620) - (7,620)\nOther gains/(losses) - - - 30 - 30 (4,207) (4,177)\nOther income 50 69 - - - 119 - 119\nDepreciation and amortization (895) - (673) (3) (10) (1,581) - (1,581)\nOperating profit/(loss) (4,389) (228) (1,786) (340) (4,571) (11,314) (4,207) (15,521)\nRestructuring and other non-recurring\n(1) - (214) - (1,869) (2,084) - (2,084)\ncosts\nFinance expense - net (6,841) (34) 936 (50) (221) (6,210) - (6,210)\nProfit/(loss) before income tax (11,231) (262) (1,064) (390) (6,661) (19,608) (4,207) (23,815)\nIncome tax (619) - (40) 119 - (540) - (540)\nLoss for the year (11,850) (262) (1,104) (271) (6,661) (20,148) (4,207) (24,355)\nPage | 21\nStrategic Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nDiscontinued\nContinuing operations\noperations\nCritical Sustainable Critical\nYear Ended 30 June 2022 (restated) Power Solar Electric Energy Corporate Total Power\n(US dollars in thousands) Services Development Vehicles Solutions Office Continuing Services Total\nRevenue from contracts with customers 20,958 - 1,490 - - 22,448 15,168 37,616\nCosts of sales - other (18,804) - (1,504) - - (20,308) (13,842) (34,150)\nCost of sales – COVID-19 disruption (1,881) - - - - (1,881) - (1,881)\nGross profit 273 - (14) - - 259 1,326 1,585\nGeneral and administrative expenses (1,568) (80) (2,901) (1,660) (7,602) (13,811) (1,485) (15,296)\nOther gains/(losses) 103 (139) - 23 - (13) - (13)\nOther income 662 - - - - 662 324 986\nDepreciation and amortization (1,165) - (443) (3) (9) (1,620) (767) (2,387)\nOperating profit/(loss) (1,695) (219) (3,358) (1,640) (7,611) (14,523) (602) (15,125)\nRestructuring and other non-recurring\n45 - (429) - (59) (443) - (443)\ncosts\nFinance expense – net (7,470) - (974) 23 (10) (8,431) (172) (8,603)\nProfit/(loss) before income tax (9,120) (219) (4,761) (1,617) (7,680) (23,397) (774) (24,171)\nIncome tax 1,349 - 575 192 (148) 1,968 149 2,117\nLoss for the year (7,771) (219) (4,186) (1,425) (7,828) (21,429) (625) (22,054)\nPage | 22\nStrategic Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nPrincipal Risks and Uncertainties\nVivoPower is exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties which could have a material impact on the\nGroup’s long-term performance and could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and\nexpected results.\nAbility to secure capital at attractive rates and terms\nOur operations and our future plans for expansion are capital intensive requiring significant investment in\noperational expenditures and capital expenditures to realize the growth potential of our electric vehicle,\ncritical power services, sustainable energy solutions and solar development businesses. In addition, we are\nsubject to substantial and ongoing administrative and related expenses required to operate and grow a\npublic company. Together these items impose substantial requirements on our cash flow and the specific\ntiming of cash inflows and outflows may fluctuate substantially from period to period. As a result, we expect\nto require some combination of additional financing options in order to execute our strategy and meet the\noperating cash flow requirements necessary to operate and grow our business. We may need or want to\nraise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities or through obtaining\ncredit from financial institutions to fund, together with our principal sources of liquidity, the costs of\ndeveloping and manufacturing our current or future products, to pay any significant unplanned or\naccelerated expenses or for new significant strategic investments, or to refinance our significant\nconsolidated indebtedness, even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness. We may not be\nable to obtain the additional or requisite funding on favourable terms when required, or at all, in order to\nexecute our strategic development plans or to meet our cash flow needs. Our inability to obtain funding or\nengage in strategic transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, our strategic\ndevelopment plan for future growth, our financial condition, and our results of operations.\nAbility to maintain sufficient liquidity to sustain our operations and continue as a Going Concern\nWe experienced a loss of $24.3 million, $22.1 million and $8.0 million for the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022\nand 2021, respectively. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenue from the operation of our businesses,\ngrow our electric vehicle sales, and generate sales of SES projects, or if we are unable to reduce our expenses\nsufficiently, we may continue to experience substantial losses.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and do not\ninclude any adjustments that result from uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nHowever, if losses continue, and if we are unable raise additional financing on sufficiently attractive terms or\ngenerate cash through sales of solar projects or other material assets or other means, then we may not have\nsufficient liquidity to sustain our operations and may not be able to continue as a going concern. Similarly,\nthe report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements\nas of and for the year ended June 30, 2023 includes an explanatory paragraph indicating that a material\nuncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. Our\nconsolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of\nthis uncertainty.\nMarket demand for our products and services\nOur business and revenues depend on the demand for our products and services. The market demand for\nelectric vehicles, critical power services, sustainable energy solutions and solar development projects is\nheavily influenced by a range of factors that include the governmental economic, fiscal, and political polices\nat both the national and state levels in the U.S., Australia, Europe, the United Kingdom and the rest of the\nworld, as well as global economic and political factors affecting the cost, availability, and desirability of\nrenewable energy, other energy sources. Other external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic and\ngeopolitical tension in Ukraine may also affect demand for our products and services.\nPage | 23\nStrategic Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nCompetitiveness of our products and services\nOur products and services need to be competitive in terms of price and quality with competition in each of\nour markets. Tembo in particular operates in a market that is relatively new, rapidly evolving, characterized\nby rapidly changing technologies, new competitors, evolving government regulation and industry\nstandards, frequent new vehicle announcements and changing consumer demands and behaviors. In order\nto stay competitive and relevant, it needs to continuously innovate and invest in product development and\nnew technologies. Our critical power services businesses face pricing pressure in a competitive market and\nmust continually improve cost efficiencies.\nOperational scale up of electric vehicle assembly and delivery capabilities\nTembo faces operational risks as a maker of battery-electric ruggedized and offroad vehicles embarking on\nan exponential scale up of its assembly and delivery capabilities. Growth is dependent on securing\nappropriate premises and equipment, achieving design and manufacturing process goals, achieving\ncompliance with safety regulations and standards, recruiting and retaining suitably qualified personnel,\novercoming any delays and, resolving any supply chain shortages, to be able to deliver the volume and\nquality of products required to meet customer commitments.\nDelivering electric vehicle products and services to customers requirements and regulatory standards\nFollowing the acquisition of Tembo, we signed distribution agreements with a number of partners globally,\nto sell Tembo EUV conversion kits. Meeting the technical specifications, quality and safety standards of our\ncustomers and partners is a key driver of ensuring Tembo’s brand, reputation, revenue and future prospects.\nProduct failures in service could leave us exposed to future warranty claims. Failure to meet the required\nregulations and standards in the markets we serve could require product recalls and fines and penalties.\nDevelopment and scale up of the SES solutions business\nWhilst we have experience in developing, financing, building and operating solar power systems and\ndistributed generation solar systems, we have limited experience and track record in combining this\nexperience to then develop and offer a complete SES solution with microgrids, battery recycling and reuse\nand are still in the process of building the capabilities in the team. Developing and/or acquiring these\ncapabilities is a key factor in expanding our SES solutions business.\nSupply chain execution\nMaterials deliveries from suppliers are at risk of disruption due to external events and factors such as COVID-\n19, semiconductor shortages and conflict in Ukraine. Overcoming challenging supply chain issues is a key\nfactor in our businesses being able to deliver goods and services to our customers in line with their\nrequirements and meet our revenue growth targets.\nInflation\nThe economic volatility attributable initially to COVID-19 and then to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is part of\nand contributing to a larger trend of rising inflation around the globe, which may have a significant adverse\neffect on economic activity and our business.\nAbility to secure capital at attractive rates and terms\nOur businesses are capital intensive requiring significant investment in operational expenditure and capital\nexpenditure to realize the growth potential of our electric vehicle, critical power services, sustainable energy\nsolutions and solar development businesses. In addition, we are subject to significant and ongoing\nadministrative and related expenses required to operate and grow a public company. Together these items\nimpose substantial legal and financial compliance costs. As a result, we expect to require some combination\nof additional financing options in order to execute our strategy and meet the operating cash flow\nrequirements necessary to operate and grow our business.\nPage | 24\nStrategic Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nCurrency fluctuations\nWe conduct business in the U.S., Australia, United Arab Emirates, the Netherlands and the U.K. As a result,\nwe are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly between the\nU.S. dollar, the British Pound, the Euro and the Australian dollar.\nAbility to attract and retain talent\nWe are looking to rapidly hyperscale our business in the face of fierce competition for talent and short\ntimeframes. To achieve our operational goals, we need to attract high calibre talent quickly.\nEmployees\nPeople are central to our business and the contribution of talented and motivated employees is vital to the\ncontinued success of the Group. The Group has a policy of keeping employees informed of, and engaged in,\nits business strategy through regular briefings and team meetings. Employee involvement at all levels is\nencouraged.\nIt is a policy of the Group to recruit, develop and promote people on merit and to treat everyone equally\nregardless of their race, ethnic origin or nationality, age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, religion or\nbelief.\nThe Group gives every consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons where the\nrequirements of the position may be adequately covered by the abilities of the applicant concerned. In the\nevent of members of staff becoming disabled, ways are examined to ensure that their employment with the\nGroup continues and that the appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the Group to ensure that the\ntraining, career development and promotion of disabled employees should, as far as possible, be the same\nas that of other employees.\nThe table shows the number of staff of each gender employed at the Company and their level of seniority.\nFemale Male Total\nDirectors 1 4 5\nSenior Manager 4 9 13\nEmployees 11 69 80\nTotal 16 82 98\nHealth and Safety\nThe health and safety of the Group’s employees, customers, and visitors is of primary importance. The Group\nis committed to creating and maintaining a safe and healthy working environment. Health and safety audits\nand risk assessments, including fire risk assessments, are carried out regularly.\nThe Environment\nThe Group recognises the importance of environmental responsibility and believes that its direct activities\nhave a positive impact on the environment as the Company facilitates greater use of renewable energy. In\naddition, lightly damaged solar panels, that would have otherwise been bound for landfill, are donated to\ncharity.\nPage | 25\nStrategic Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nCommunities\nVivoPower has maintained an active program of community involvement in the locations we operate,\nincluding support for local children’s sport teams and engagement with other worthwhile causes supported\nby our employees. In addition, as noted above, the Company donates lightly damaged solar panels to a\ncharity that provides aid to the impoverished, supports local education initiatives, and assists with charitable\nrenewable energy projects.\nB Corporation Certification\nVivoPower became certified as a B Corporation in April 2018.

Under that law they have elected to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance\nwith UK-adopted international accounting standards and applicable law and have elected to prepare the\nfinancial statements for Company under the same methodology.\nUnder company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that\nthey give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their profit or\nloss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial statements, the directors\nare required to:\n• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\n• state whether applicable UK-adopted international accounting standards have been followed, subject\nto any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and,\n• prepare the financial on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group\nand parent company will continue in business.\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and\nexplain the Group’s and parent company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time\nthe financial position of the Group and parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial\nstatements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as\nare reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and parent company and to prevent and\ndetect fraud and other irregularities.\nThis annual report and financial statements together with the Notice of Annual General Meeting and other\ninformation regarding the Group may be viewed on the Company’s website at www.vivopower.com.\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information\nincluded on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of\nthe financial statements may differ from the legislation in other jurisdictions in which the Company operates,\nincluding the U.S. and Australia.\nPage | 29\nDirectors’ Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nThe Directors consider the Company’s ongoing commitment to B Corp certification and continual\nimprovement thereunder, as discussed on page 21 of the Strategic Report, as the primary means by which\nthe Directors have had regard to the matters set out in section 172(1) of the Companies Act 2006 when\nperforming their duty to act in the way most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of\nits members as a whole.\nDirectors’ Insurance and Indemnities\nThe Directors have the benefit of the indemnity provisions contained in the Company’s Articles of Association\nand the Company has maintained throughout the year directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for the\nbenefit of the Company, the Directors and its officers.\nThe Company has entered into qualifying third-party indemnity arrangements for the benefit of all its\nDirectors in a form and scope which comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and which\nwere in force throughout the year and remain in force.\nFuture Developments\nA detailed description of the Group’s business operations, results for the year ended 30 June 2023, and likely\nfuture developments are presented in detail in the Strategic Report.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe Group’s principal financial instruments are bank balances, cash and medium-term loans. The main\npurpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Group’s funding and liquidity requirements. The\nGroup also has other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly\nfrom its operations. The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s\nrisk management framework. Policy for managing risks is set by the Chief Executive Officer and is\nimplemented by the Group’s finance department. All risks are managed centrally with a tight control of all\nfinancial matters. For additional information on the composition of financial instruments, management\nobjectives and policies, risk exposure and mitigation refer to Note 30 of the financial statements.\nGoing Concern\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.\nAs at June 30, 2023, the Company had unrestricted cash totalling $0.6 million, compared to $1.3 million as\nat June 30, 2022 and $8.6 million as at June 30, 2021. It also has outstanding debt and borrowing totaling\n$32.4 million, compared to $28.6 million as at June 30, 2022 and $23.1 million as at June 30, 2021. Most of\nthese borrowings do not fall due for repayment until 1 April 2025 and are thus classified under long-term\nliabilities.\nOver the next twelve months, the Company expects significant growth in revenues and continued EBITDA\ngeneration in critical power systems, a material increase in revenue and costs in scaling up the Electric\nVehicles business as the operation scales series production of its EUV23 conversion kits to match the\ndemand from its signed partnerships. The Company will also be investing in further capitalized development\ncosts in electric vehicles in preparation for Tembo series production. In addition, it expects to fund selective\ndevelopment of the U.S. solar portfolio to maximize future sales proceeds, as well as development of\nmicrogrid, EV charging and battery energy storage capabilities, as part of the scaling up of the SES business\nunit. The Company will also be investing in property, plant and equipment, particularly in Tembo.\nThis expected growth implies sizeable funding requirements over FY2024, which the Company is planning to\nfinance through significant equity capital raises, asset-backed financing, debtor financing, working capital\noptimization with suppliers and customers, and tax relief on R&D expenditure, either at Group or subsidiary\nlevels depending on what is best suited to the Company’s growth needs and optimizing for cost of capital.\nPage | 30\nDirectors’ Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nTo ensure success of the business, the directors have reviewed additional plans to mitigate any cash flow\nrisk that may arise during the next twelve months. These include:\n• Regular re-forecasting process and flexing of opex and capex cost growth according to liquidity needs;\n• Phased approach to hiring of personnel to sustain growth of the Tembo business;\n• Staging the timing of property, plant and equipment and software capex to match asset-backed\nfinancing inflows;\n• Obtain Research & Development grants in the U.K., Europe and Australia to help fund investment in\nelectric, solar and battery technologies;\n• Careful project planning and commercial structuring of SES projects;\n• Possible sale, spin off, or distribution in specie of Caret, LLC (\"Caret\"), formerly Innovative Solar Ventures\nI, LLC (\"ISV\");\n• Purchase order financing, debtor financing facilities;\n• Staging the timing of equity raises to minimize dilution; and\n• Renegotiation of terms on loans and supply chain.\nBased on the foregoing expectations of funding needs, and actions prepared and presented by management\nto the Board of Directors, the Directors consider that these actions can provide sufficient cash to support\nbusiness operations and meet funding requirements as they become due, despite financial, economic and\npolitical uncertainty. If we continue to experience losses and we are not able to raise additional financing to\nprovide the funding to grow the revenue streams of the Company to become profit making, or generate cash\nthrough sales of assets, we may not have sufficient liquidity to sustain our operations and to continue as a\ngoing concern, accordingly there is a material uncertainty that may cause significant doubt about the going\nconcern nature of the Group. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that\nmight result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nLegal Proceedings\nOn February 26, 2018, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, Phillip Comberg, filed a legal claim\nalleging the Company committed a repudiatory breach of his service agreement in connection with the\ntermination of his employment on October 4, 2017. On April 9, 2018, the Company filed a defense and\ncounterclaim, denying that a repudiatory breach was committed by the Company and denying the other\nclaims asserted by Mr. Comberg, claiming that Mr. Comberg was terminated for cause. On November 26,\n2018, the Company agreed to a settlement of the counterclaims against Mr. Comberg for an undisclosed\namount. After aborted attempts at settlement, the matter was heard in the U.K. High Court, with judgement\nruled in September 2020. The Company was successful in defending the majority of the claims, with a total\nof £0.62 million ($0.90 million) of the claims being settled in favor of Mr. Comberg. However final costs and\ninterest awarded to him were $1.76 million. Of the remaining provision as at June 30, 2021 of $0.5 million\nfor unpaid costs, $0.4 million was spent in the year ended June 30, 2022, resulting in a $0.1 million release\nof the remaining unutilized provision.\nAdditionally, on May 31, 2022 the William Q. Richards Estate (the “Plaintiff” or the “Estate”) filed a complaint\nagainst VivoPower USA LLC, Caret, LLC (“Caret”), formerly Innovative Solar Ventures I, LLC (“ISV”), and\nrelated entities (the \"VivoPower Defendants\") alleging the VivoPower Defendants improperly included land\nowned by the Estate in the reinvestment zone of the tax abatement agreements executed on March 14,\n2022 between Cottle County, Texas and the Company’s subsidiaries Innovative Solar 144, LLC and\nInnovative Solar 145, LLC. The complaint sought to nullify and/or declare the tax abatement agreements\nvoid. The Estate filed an amended complaint on August 18, 2022, further detailing their claims and\nrequesting unspecified damages. On September 16, 2022, the VivoPower Defendants filed a motion to\nPage | 31\nDirectors’ Report\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\ndismiss Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint, which the Court subsequently granted on January 23, 2023, stating\nthat the Plaintiff had failed “to establish that the amount in controversy had been met.” On February 20,\n2023, the Estate filed a second amended complaint to argue that the amount in controversy was met.\nRegina, widow of the late William Q. Richards, was added as a plaintiff in the second amended complaint.\nOn March 6, 2023, the VivoPower Defendants filed a new motion to dismiss the Plaintiffs’ second amended\ncomplaint. On May 5, 2023, the Plaintiffs filed an instant opposition to the VivoPower Defendants’ motions\nto dismiss. On May 19, 2023, the VivoPower Defendants submitted a reply supporting their motion to\ndismiss requesting the dismissal of the Plaintiffs' claim. The Company does not expect the Plaintiff to be\nsuccessful in its complaint. Accordingly no provision has been recorded as at June 30, 2023 in relation to\nthis matter.\nDonations\nDuring the year ended 30 June 2023, the Group made no political donations nor other political expenditures.\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions\nThe Company has taken exemption from reporting on Greenhouse Gas emissions on the basis it consumed\nless than 40,000kWh during the period in the UK.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and\nUK-adopted international accounting standards and as regards the parent company financial statements,\nas applied in accordance with the provisions of Companies Act 2006.\nIn our opinion, the financial statements:\n• give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 June\n2023 and of the group’s loss for the year then ended;\n• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted\ninternational accounting standards;\n• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-\nadopted international accounting standards and as applied in accordance with the provisions of\nthe Companies Act 2006; and\n• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and\napplicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s\nresponsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the\ncompany in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial\nstatements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled\nour other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence\nwe have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nMaterial uncertainty related to going concern\nWe draw attention to note 2.1 in the financial statements, which indicates that the group has significant\noutstanding liabilities and needs to raise funds either through debt or equity in order to meet its obligations\nas they fall due and to support the planned growth of the Group during the going concern period. As stated\nin note 2.1, these events or conditions, along with the other matters as set forth in note 2.1, indicate that a\nmaterial uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going\nconcern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the director’s use of the going concern basis of\naccounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors’\nassessment of the company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included\nobtaining an understanding of the basis of preparation of Board approved budgets and cash flow forecasts,\nassessing the accuracy of historic forecasts to actual results, testing the key underlying assumptions and\nPage | 44\nIndependent Auditor’s Report to the Members of VivoPower International PLC\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nperforming sensitivity analysis on possible changes which could impact the available headroom. We also\nreviewed and evaluated the Board approved memorandum on going concern.\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in\nthe relevant sections of this report.\nOur application of materiality\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative\nthresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope\nof our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement\nline items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the\nfinancial statements as a whole.\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the group financial statements as a\nwhole to be $315,000 (2022 - $672,000). This was calculated by applying 3.5% of net assets (2022 – average\nof 1.5% of revenue and 3% of net assets). We selected net assets as the materiality benchmark as we\nconsidered this to be the most significant determinant of the group’s performance. The group has a portfolio\nof solar project assets in Australia and the United States of America and other intangible assets in the\nNetherlands. There is a change to the materiality benchmark in the current year due primarily to the revenue\nreduction following the disposal of the JA Martin business and we set materiality based on net assets as this\nis deemed to be the most relevant benchmark throughout the group.\nThe parent company materiality was $42,000 (2022 - $100,000) based upon 2% of expenses (2022 - 2% of\nexpenses) in order to ensure adequate coverage of expenditure.\nPerformance materiality is the application of materiality at the individual account or balance level set to\nreduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected\nmisstatements exceeds materiality for the financial statements as a whole. Performance materiality for the\ngroup and parent company was set at 70% of overall materiality to reflect the risk associated with the\njudgemental and key areas of management estimation in the financial statements.\nOverall component materiality for significant and/or material subsidiary undertakings ranged from $16,000\nto $210,000 (2022 - $25,000 to $370,000). Performance materiality for all components was set at 70% of\noverall component materiality.\nWe agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to them all individual audit differences\nidentified during the course of our audit in excess of $15,750 (2022 – $33,600) for the group and $2,100 (2022\n- $5,000) for the parent company.\nOur approach to the audit\nIn designing our audit, we determined materiality, as above, and assessed the risk of material misstatement\nin the financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for\nexample in respect of significant accounting estimates. We also addressed the risk of management override\nof internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias in determining judgements and\nestimates by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\nThe accounting records of all significant and/or material subsidiary undertakings in Australia were audited\nby component auditors and in Netherlands by a subcontractor, under the oversight of us as group auditor in\naccordance with International Standard on Auditing 600, based upon component materiality and the risk to\nthe group.\nPage | 45\nIndependent Auditor’s Report to the Members of VivoPower International PLC\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit\nof the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material\nmisstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on:\nthe overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement\nteam. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and\nin forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\nIn addition to the matter described in the Material uncertainty related to going concern section we have\ndetermined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.\nKey Audit Matter How our scope addressed this matter\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue for the year ended 30 June 2023 Our work in this area included:\namounted to $15.1 million and details of the • Updating our understanding of the internal\nrelated critical judgements and estimates are\ncontrol environment for the significant\ndisclosed in note 3.1.\nrevenue streams, and checking by\nwalkthrough tests our understanding of the\nThere is a risk of misstatement of revenue from\ncontracts with customers to include: internal control environment for the\n• Identification of performance obligations in significant income streams;\ncustomer contracts; • Reviewing the work undertaken by\n• Judging the timing and satisfaction of component auditors in accordance with the\nperformance obligations; issued component instructions, including\n• Allocation of transaction price; regular communication throughout the\n• Measuring the stage of completion for long\naudit;\nterm contracts; and\n• Performing controls testing on the key\n• Determining the costs incurred to obtain or\ncontrols applicable to the contract and\nfulfil contracts with customers.\nrevenue cycle;\n• Substantively testing a sample of contracts\nconcluded and in progress at the year-end,\nincluding contract assets and liabilities and\ndeferred and accrued income, and testing\nthe stage of completion;\n• Reviewing post year-end cash receipts and\ndocuments to test the completeness, cut-off\nand accuracy of revenue around the year-\nend; and\n• Ensuring the revenue related disclosures in\nthe financial statements are complete and\naccurate.\nPage | 46\nIndependent Auditor’s Report to the Members of VivoPower International PLC\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nRecoverability of intangible assets and tests for\nimpairment.\nAs at 30 June 2023 the carrying value of goodwill Our work in this area included:\nand intangible assets was $42.5 million.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other\ninformation and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of\nassurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider\nwhether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge\nobtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such\nmaterial inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this\ngives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have\nperformed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to\nreport that fact.\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\nOpinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n• the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which\nthe financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\nPage | 47\nIndependent Auditor’s Report to the Members of VivoPower International PLC\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\n• the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable\nlegal requirements.\nMatters on which we are required to report by exception\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course\nof the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006\nrequires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n• adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been\nreceived from branches not visited by us; or\n• the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\nResponsibilities of directors\nAs explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the\npreparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such\ninternal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements\nthat are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company’s ability to\ncontinue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going\nconcern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease\noperations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are\nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes\nour opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit\nconducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,\nthey could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these\nfinancial statements.\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design\nprocedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of\nirregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities,\nincluding fraud is detailed below:\n• We obtained an understanding of the group and parent company and the sector in which it operates\nto identify laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a direct effect on the\nfinancial statements. We obtained our understanding in this regard through discussions with\nmanagement, industry research, application of cumulative audit knowledge and experience of the\nsectors.\nPage | 48\n\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\nYear Ended 30 June\n(US dollars in thousands, except per share 2022\n2023 2021\namounts) Note (restated)\nRevenue from contracts with customers 4 15,060 22,448 23,975\nCost of sales (13,472) (20,308) (19,614)\nCost of sales – non-recurring (3,850) (1,881) -\nGross (loss)/profit (2,262) 259 4,361\nGeneral and administrative expenses (7,620) (13,811) (9,651)\nOther gains/(losses) 5 30 (13) 769\nOther income 6 119 662 960\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment 13 (750) (770) (638)\nAmortisation of intangible assets 14 (831) (850) (815)\nOperating loss 7 (11,314) (14,523) (5,014)\nRestructuring and other non-recurring costs 8 (2,084) (443) (2,877)\nFinance income 10 1,156 173 2,176\nFinance expense 10 (7,366) (8,604) (2,450)\nLoss before income tax (19,608) (23,397) (8,165)\nIncome tax 11 (540) 1,968 138\nLoss for the continuing operations (20,148) (21,429) (8,027)\n(Loss)/profit from discontinued operations (4,207) (625) 69\nLoss for the period (24,355) (22,054) (7,958)\nLosses attributed to:\nEquity owners of VivoPower International Plc (24,355) (22,054) (7,571)\nNon-controlling interests -

Reporting entity\nVivoPower International PLC (“VivoPower” or the “Company”) is a public company limited by shares and\nincorporated under the laws of England and Wales and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The address of the\nCompany’s registered office is The Scalpel, 18th Floor, 52 Lime Street, London EC3M 7AF, United Kingdom.\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its\nsubsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’ and individually as ‘Group entities’). Since June 30, 2021, the\nCompany no longer has an ultimate controlling party, as AWN Holdings Limited holds less than 50% equity\ninterest in the Company, being 39.5% as at June 30, 2023. In prior periods, the ultimate controlling party and\nthe results into which these financials were consolidated was AWN Holdings Limited, a company registered\nin Australia.\n2. Significant accounting policies\nThe principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.\nThese policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented, unless otherwise stated.\n2.1. Basis of preparation\nVivoPower International PLC consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with UK\nadopted International Accounting Standards (UK IAS),IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006\napplicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared\nunder the historical cost convention, except when accounting for acquisitions, whereby fair values have been\napplied.\nThe preparation of financial statements with adopted UK IAS requires the use of critical accounting\nestimates. It also requires the management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Company’s\naccounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where the\nassumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 3.\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.\nAs at June 30, 2023, the Company had unrestricted cash totalling $0.6 million, compared to $1.3 million as\nat June 30, 2022 and $8.6 million as at June 30, 2021. It also has outstanding debt and borrowing totaling\n$32.4 million, compared to $28.6 million as at June 30, 2022 and $23.1 million as at June 30, 2021. Most of\nthese borrowings do not fall due for repayment until 1 April 2025 and are thus classified under long-term\nliabilities.\nOver the next twelve months, the Company expects significant growth in revenues and continued EBITDA\ngeneration in critical power systems, a material increase in revenue and costs in scaling up the Electric\nVehicles business as the operation scales series production of its EUV23 conversion kits to match the\ndemand from its signed partnerships. The Company will also be investing in further capitalized development\ncosts in electric vehicles in preparation for Tembo series production. In addition, it expects to fund selective\ndevelopment of the U.S. solar portfolio to maximize future sales proceeds, as well as development of\nmicrogrid, EV charging and battery energy storage capabilities, as part of the scaling up of the SES business\nunit. The Company will also be investing in property, plant and equipment, particularly in Tembo.\nThis expected growth implies sizeable funding requirements over FY2024, which the Company is planning to\nfinance through significant equity capital raises, asset-backed financing, debtor financing, working capital\noptimization with suppliers and customers, and tax relief on R&D expenditure, either at Group or subsidiary\nlevels depending on what is best suited to the Company’s growth needs and optimizing for cost of capital.\nPage | 55\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nTo ensure success of the business, the directors have reviewed additional plans to mitigate any cash flow\nrisk that may arise during the next twelve months. These include:\n● Regular re-forecasting process and flexing of opex and capex cost growth according to\nliquidity needs;\n● Phased approach to hiring of personnel to sustain growth of the Tembo business;\n● Staging the timing of property, plant and equipment and software capex to match asset-\nbacked financing inflows;\n● Obtain Research & Development grants in the U.K., Europe and Australia to help fund\ninvestment in electric, solar and battery technologies;\n● Careful project planning and commercial structuring of SES projects;\n● Possible sale, spin off, or distribution in specie of Caret, LLC (\"Caret\"), formerly Innovative\nSolar Ventures I, LLC (\"ISV\");\n● Purchase order financing, debtor financing facilities;\n● Staging the timing of equity raises to minimize dilution; and\n● Renegotiation of terms on loans and supply chain.\nBased on the foregoing expectations of funding needs, and actions prepared and presented by management\nto the Board of Directors, the Directors consider that these actions can provide sufficient cash to support\nbusiness operations and meet funding requirements as they become due, despite financial, economic and\npolitical uncertainty. If we continue to experience losses and we are not able to raise additional financing to\nprovide the funding to grow the revenue streams of the Company to become profit making, or generate cash\nthrough sales of assets, we may not have sufficient liquidity to sustain our operations and to continue as a\ngoing concern, accordingly there is a material uncertainty that may cause significant doubt about the going\nconcern nature of the Group. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that\nmight result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nAll financial information presented in US dollars has been rounded to the nearest thousand.\n2.2. Basis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include those of VivoPower International PLC and all of its subsidiary\nundertakings.\nSubsidiary undertakings are those entities controlled directly or indirectly by the Company. The Company\ncontrols an investee when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the\nentity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The results of the\nsubsidiaries acquired are included in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income from the date\nof acquisition using the same accounting policies of those of the Group. All business combinations are\naccounted for using the purchase method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is the\nfair value at the acquisition date of the assets transferred and the liabilities incurred by the Group and\nincludes the fair value of any contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are\nrecognized in the income statement as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent\nliabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date.\nWhere necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting\npolicies in line with those used by other members of the Group.\nAll intra-group balances and transactions, including any unrealized income and expense arising from intra-\ngroup transactions, are eliminated in full in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealized\ngains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the\nextent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized\ngains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\nPage | 56\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\n2.3. Business combination\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of\nwhether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. The consideration transferred for the acquisition\nof a subsidiary comprises the:\n• fair values of the assets transferred\n• liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired businesses\n• equity interests issued by the Company\n• fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, and\n• fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary.\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are,\nwith limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognizes\nany non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at fair value\nor at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets.\nAcquisition-related costs are expenses as incurred.\nThe excess of the:\n• consideration transferred\n• amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and\n• acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity\nover the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If those amounts are less\nthan the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the business acquired, the difference is recognized directly\nin profit or loss as a bargain purchase.\nWhere settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are\ndiscounted to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity’s\nincremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an\nindependent financier under comparable terms and conditions.\nContingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a financial\nliability are subsequently remeasured to fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.\nIf the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s\npreviously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains\nor losses arising from such remeasurement are recognized in profit or loss.\n2.4. Intangible assets\nAll intangible assets, except goodwill, are stated at fair value less accumulated amortization and any\naccumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortized and is stated at cost less any accumulated\nimpairment losses. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognized in profit or loss immediately.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill arose on the effective acquisition of VivoPower Pty Ltd, Aevitas O Holdings Limited (“Aevitas”) and\nTembo e-LV B.V. Goodwill is reviewed annually to test for impairment.\nNegative goodwill arose on the acquisition of the remaining 50% share in the ISS Joint Venture, constituting\na bargain purchase. The gain was immediately recognized in the profit and loss during the year ended June\n30, 2021.\nPage | 57\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nOther intangible assets\nIntangible assets acquired through a business combination are initially measured at fair value and then\namortized over their useful economic lives. Subsequent expenditure is capitalized only when it increases the\nfuture economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.\nDevelopment expenditure includes the product development project for ruggedized electric vehicles in\nTembo, pre-series-production expenditure on developing vehicle specifications and production processes.\nCapitalized costs include primarily internal payroll costs, external consultants and computer software.\nDevelopment expenditure on U.S. solar projects includes securing land rights, completing feasibility studies,\nnegotiating power purchase agreements, and other costs incurred to prepare project sales for Notice to\nProceed with construction and hence sale to a partner as a shovel ready project.\nFor both electric vehicles product development project, and U.S. solar development projects, it is the\nCompany’s intention to complete the projects. It expects to obtain adequate technical, financial and other\nresources to complete the projects, and management consider that it is probable for the future economic\nbenefits attributable to the development expenditure to flow to the entity; and that the cost of the asset can\nbe measured reliably. Accordingly, the development expenditure is recognized under IAS 38 – Intangible\nAssets as an intangible asset.\nAll other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, and research\ncosts, are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.\nAmortization is calculated on a straight-line basis to write down the assets over their useful economic lives\nat the following rates:\n• Development expenditure – 5 to 10 years\n• Customer relationships – 5 to 10 years\n• Trade names – 15 to 25 years\n• Favourable supply contracts – 15 years\n• Other – 5 years\n2.5. Property, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated\nimpairment losses. The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price and\nthe costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into use.\nWhen parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted as\nseparate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis so as to write down the assets to their estimated residual\nvalue over their useful economic lives at the following rates:\n• Computer equipment– 3 years\n• Fixtures and fittings– 3 to 20 years\n• Motor vehicles– 5 years\n• Plant and equipment – 3.5 to 10 years\n• Right-of-use assets – remaining term of lease\nPage | 58\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\n2.6. Assets classified as held for sale and discontinued operations\nAssets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale\ntransaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured\nat the lower of their carrying value and fair value less costs to sell. An impairment loss is recognised for any\nsubsequent write-down of the asset to fair value less costs to sell.\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Company that has been disposed of or is classified as held\nfor sale and represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations. The results of\ndiscontinued operations are presented separately in the statement of profit or loss.\n2.7. Inventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, in accordance with IAS 2 – Inventories.\nThe cost includes all direct and indirect variable production expenses, plus fixed expenses based on the\nnormal capacity of each production facility. The net realizable value of inventories intended to be sold\ncorresponds to their selling price, as estimated based on market conditions and any relevant external\ninformation sources, less the estimated costs necessary to complete the sale.\n2.8. Leases\nThe Group leases offices, workshops, motor vehicles, and equipment for fixed periods of 2 months to 8 years\nbut may have extension options. Extension options are not recognized by the Group in the determination of\nlease liabilities unless renewals are reasonably certain.\nContracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the consideration in the\ncontract to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices. However, for\nleases of real estate for which the Group is a lessee, it has elected not to separate lease and non-lease\ncomponents and instead accounts for these as a single lease component.\nLease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and\nconditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants other than the security interests in the\nleased assets that are held by the lessor. Leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.\nLeases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased\nasset is available for use by the Group.\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis, with lease payments\ndiscounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s\nincremental borrowing rate is used. The Group presents lease liabilities in loans and borrowings in the\nStatement of Financial Position.\nLease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the\nStatement of Comprehensive Income over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of\ninterest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.\nRight-of-use assets are presented in property, plant and equipment and depreciated over the shorter of the\nasset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.\nPage | 59\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\n2.9. Impairment of non-financial assets\nGoodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purposes of impairment testing. The recoverable\namount of the cash-generating unit (‘CGU’) to which the goodwill relates is tested annually for impairment\nor when events or changes to circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.\nThe carrying values of property, plant and equipment, investments and intangible assets other than goodwill\nare reviewed for impairment only when events indicate the carrying value may be impaired.\nIn an impairment test the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit or asset is estimated in order to\ndetermine the existence or extent of any impairment loss. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value\nless costs to sell and the value in use to the Group. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the\ncarrying value exceeds the recoverable amount. In determining a cash-generating unit’s or asset’s value in\nuse, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that\nreflects current market assessments of the time-value of money and risks specific to the cash-generating unit\nor asset that have not already been included in the estimate of future cash flows. All impairment losses are\nrecognized in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.\nAn impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In the case of other assets, impairment losses\nrecognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has\ndecreased or no longer exists. These impairment losses are reversed if there has been any change in the\nestimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent so\nthat the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying value that would have been determined, net\nof depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n2.10. Financial Instruments\nFinancial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Group’s Statement of Financial Position when the Group\nbecomes a party to the contracted provision of the instrument. The following policies for financial\ninstruments have been applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n• those to be measured subsequently at fair value through profit or loss; and,\n• those to be measured at amortised cost.\nThe classification depends on the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual\nterms of the cash flows. Financial assets are classified as at amortised cost only if both of the following criteria\nare met:\n• the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows; and,\n• the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on\nthe presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\n• in the principal market for the asset or liability; or,\n• in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group. The fair value of an asset\nor a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset\nor liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.\nPage | 60\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are\ncategorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is\nsignificant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\n• Level 1–- quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n• Level 2–- valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement is directly or indirectly observable; and\n• Level 3–- valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement is unobservable.\nCash and cash equivalents\nFor the purpose of preparation of the Statement of Cash Flow, cash and cash equivalents includes cash at\nbank and in hand.\nRestricted cash\nRestricted cash are cash and cash equivalents whose availability for use within the Group is subject to\ncertain restrictions by third parties.\nBank borrowings\nInterest-bearing bank loans are recorded at the proceeds received. Direct issue costs paid on the\nestablishment of loan facilities are recognised over the term of the loan on a straight-line basis. The initial\npayment is taken to the Statement of Financial Position and then amortised over the full-length of the facility.\nTrade and other receivables\nTrade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised\ncost using the effective interest method, less any allowance for the expected future issue of credit notes and\nfor non-recoverability due to credit risk. The Group applies the IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments simplified\napproach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade\nreceivables and contract assets. To measure expected credit losses, trade receivables and contract assets\nhave been grouped based on shared risk characteristics.\nTrade and other payables\nTrade and other payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at amortised cost using the effective\ninterest method.\nShare capital\nOrdinary Shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of Ordinary\nShares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.\nRepurchase of share capital (treasury shares)\nWhen share capital recognised as equity is repurchased as equity by the Company the amount of the\nconsideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, net of any tax effects, is recognised as a\ndeduction from equity, and excluded from the number of shares in issue when calculating earnings per\nshare.\nPage | 61\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\n2.11. Taxation\nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred tax.\nCurrent tax is recognized based on the amounts expected to be paid or recovered under the tax rates and\nlaws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\nDeferred tax is provided on temporary timing differences that arise between the carrying amounts of assets\nand liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their corresponding tax values. Liabilities are recorded on\nall temporary differences except in respect of initial recognition of goodwill and in respect of investments in\nsubsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is\nprobable that it will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent\nthat it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be offset. Deferred\ntax is measured on an undiscounted basis using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or\nsubstantively enacted by the end of the accounting period.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets\nand liabilities, they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group intends to settle\ncurrent tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized\nsimultaneously.\nCurrent and deferred tax are recognized in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, except when the tax\nrelates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case it is dealt with directly in equity.\n2.12. Provisions\nProvisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation because of a past event, it is probable\nthat the Group will be required to settle that obligation, and it can be measured reliably.\nProvisions are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation\nat the date of Statement of Financial Position.\nWhere the time value of money is material, provisions are measured at the present value of expenditures\nexpected to be paid in settlement.\n2.13. Earnings per share\nThe Group presents basic (“EPS”) data for Ordinary Shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or\nloss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of Ordinary\nShares, excluding the shares held as treasury shares.\n2.14. Foreign currencies\nThe Company’s functional and presentational currency is the US dollar. Items included in the separate\nfinancial statements of each Group entity are measured in the functional currency of that entity. Transactions\ndenominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the entity at the rates of\nexchange prevailing at the dates of the individual transactions. Foreign currency monetary assets and\nliabilities are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the end of the reporting period.\nExchange gains and losses arising are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income within finance\nincome or expenses. The Statement of Comprehensive Income and Statement of Financial Position of\nforeign entities are translated into US dollars on consolidation at the average rates for the period and the\nrates prevailing at the end of the reporting period respectively. Exchange gains and losses arising on the\ntranslation of the Group’s net investment foreign entities are recognized as a separate component of\nshareholders’ equity.\nPage | 62\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nForeign currency denominated share capital and related share premium and reserve accounts are recorded\nat the historical exchange rate at the time the shares were issued, or the equity created.\n2.15. Revenue from contracts with customers\nRevenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of services in the\nordinary course of the Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of discounts, value-added tax, other sales\nrelated taxes, and after the elimination of sales within the Group.\nRevenue comprises development revenues, electrical installations, electrical servicing and maintenance,\ngenerator sales, vehicle spec conversion and conversion kits. Revenue is recognized upon satisfaction of\ncontractual performance obligations.\nThe Group has a number of different revenue streams and the key components in determining the correct\nrecognition are as follows:\nDevelopment revenue, which is revenue generated from development services relating to the building and\nconstruction of solar projects, is recognized on a percentage completion basis as the value is accrued by the\nend user over the life of the contract. The periodic recognition is calculated through weekly project progress\nreports.\nOn longer-term power services projects such as large-scale equipment provision and installation, the\nperformance obligation of completing the installation is satisfied over time, and revenue is recognized on a\npercentage completion basis using an input method. Revenue for stand-alone equipment sales is\nrecognized at the point of passing control of the asset to the customer. Other revenue for small jobs and\nthose completed in a limited timeframe are recognized when the job is complete and accepted by the\ncustomer.\nRevenue for sale of electric vehicles, kits for electric vehicles and related products is recognized upon delivery\nto the customer. Where distribution agreements are agreed with external parties to participate in the\nassembly of vehicles, revenue recognition will be assessed under IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers, to establish the principal and agent in the relationship between the parties and with the end\ncustomer.\nWarranties are of short duration and only cover defective workmanship and defective materials. No\nadditional services are committed to which generate a performance obligation.\nNo adjustment is made for the effects of financing, as the Company expects, at contract inception, that the\nperiod between when the goods and services are transferred to the customer and when the customer pays,\nwill be one year or less.\nIf the revenue recognized for goods and services rendered by the Company exceeds amounts that the\nCompany is entitled to bill the customer, a contract asset is recognized. If amounts billed exceed the revenue\nrecognized for goods and services rendered, a contract liability is recognized.\nIncremental costs of obtaining a contract are expensed as incurred.\n2.16. Other income\nOther income in relation to government grants, is recognized in the period that the related costs, for which\nthe grants are intended to compensate, are expensed.\nPage | 63\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\n2.17. Employee Benefits\nPension\nThe employer pension contributions are associated with defined contribution schemes. The costs are\ntherefore recognised in the month in which the contribution is incurred, which is consistent with recognition\nof payroll expenses.\nShort-term benefits\nShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the\nrelated service is provided.\nA liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing\nplans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount because of past service\nprovided by the employee and the obligation can be reliably measured.\nShort-term compensated absences\nA liability for short-term compensated absences, such as holidays, is recognised for the amount the Group\nmay be required to pay because of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the end of the reporting\nperiod.\nShare-based payments\nShares issued to employees and other participants under the Omnibus Incentive Plan 2017 are recognised\nover the expected vesting period, using the grant date share price, in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based\nPayments.\n2.18. Restructuring and other non-recurring costs\nRestructuring and other non-recurring costs are by nature one-time incurrences and do not represent the\nnormal trading activities of the business and accordingly are disclosed separately on the Consolidated\nStatement of Comprehensive Income in accordance with IAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements in\norder to draw them to the attention of the reader of the financial statements. Restructuring costs are defined\nin accordance with IAS 37 – Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets as being related to sale\nor termination of a line of business, closure of business locations, changes in management structure, or\nfundamental reorganizations.\nOther non-recurring costs include litigation expenses for former employees, including fees for legal services\nand provisions under IAS 37 for legal fee dispute resolutions that are probable to result in a quantifiable\nfinancial outflow by the Company.\nOther non-recurring costs also include legal and professional costs for project review and investigation\ndetailed review and sales campaign for solar projects managed by the ISS joint venture partner.\nOther non-recurring costs also include one-off costs resulting from acquisition of Tembo e-LV and\nsubsidiaries and impairment and write-off of nonrecoverable items.\nOther non-recurring costs also include provisions in respect of fiscal refunds on prior receivables, which the\nCompany is defending.\nPage | 64\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\n2.19. New standards, amendments and interpretations\nAt the date of authorisation of these financial statements the following Standards and Interpretations\nwhich have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective:\nInternational Accounting Standards (amendments) Effective date*\nIAS 1 - Amendments regarding the classification of liabilities 1 January 2023\nIAS 1, IFRS Practice Statement 2 - Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 1 January 2023\n2\nIAS 1 - Amendments regarding non-current liabilities with covenants 1 January 2024\nIAS 8 (amendments) - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and 1 January 2023\nErrors – Definition of Accounting Estimates\nIFRS 16 - Amendments regarding lease liability in a sale and leaseback 1 January 2024\n* Years beginning on or after\nThe Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on\nthe financial statements of the Group or Company in future periods.\n3. Significant accounting judgements and estimates\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are required to make judgements in\napplying the Group’s accounting policies and in making estimates and making assumptions about the\nfuture. These estimates could have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value\nof assets and liabilities in the future financial periods. The critical judgements that have been made in arriving\nat the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements are discussed below.\n3.1. Revenue from contracts with customers – determining the timing of satisfaction of\nservices\nAs disclosed in Note 2.15 to the Financial Statements the Group concluded that Solar Development revenue\nand revenue from other long-term projects is recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives\nand consumes the benefits provided. The Group determined that the percentage completion basis is the\nbest method in measuring progress because there is a direct relationship between the Group’s effort and the\ntransfer of services to the customer. The judgement used in applying the percentage completion basis affects\nthe amount and timing of revenue from contracts.\n3.2. Impairment of non-financial assets\nThe carrying values of property, plant and equipment, investments and intangible assets other than goodwill\nare reviewed for impairment only when events indicate the carrying value may be impaired. Goodwill is\ntested annually for impairment or when events or changes to circumstances indicate that it might be\nimpaired.\nImpairment assessments require the use of estimates and assumptions. To assess impairment, estimated\nfuture cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current\nmarket assessments of the time-value of money and risks specific to the related cash-generating unit.\nJudgement was applied in making estimates and assumptions about the future cash flows, including the\nappropriateness of discounts rates applied, as further disclosed in Note 14. These estimates and\nassumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty. Therefore, there is a possibility that changes in\nPage | 65\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\ncircumstances will impact these projections, which may impact the recoverable amount of assets and/or\nCGUs.\n3.3. Operating profit/(loss)\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements of the Group, judgement was applied with respect to\nthose items which are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as included\nwithin operating profit/(loss). Those revenues and expenses which are determined to be specifically related\nto the on-going operating activities of the business are included within operating profit/(loss). Expenses or\ncharges to earnings which are not related to operating activities, are one-time costs determined to be not\nrepresentative of the normal trading activities of the business, or that arise from revaluation of assets, are\nreported below operating profit/(loss).\n3.4. Litigation provision\nNo litigation provision was recorded at June 30, 2023. The provision of $0.5 million for disputed legal\nsuccess fees related to the Mr. Comberg litigation recorded at June 30, 2021 was estimated by\nmanagement, making a judgement in conjunction with advice from legal counsel, on the likely outcome of\nthe claim. $0.4 million of this provision was utilized in the year ended June 30, 2022, and the remainder\nreleased.\n3.5. Capitalization of product development costs\nThe Group capitalizes costs for product development projects in the EV segment. The capitalization of costs\nis based on management’s judgement that technological and economic feasibility is confirmed, and all other\nrecognition criteria within IAS 38 can be demonstrated. In determining the amounts to be capitalized,\nmanagement makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation, discount rates to be\napplied and the expected period of benefits. As of June 30, 2023, the carrying amount of capitalized\ndevelopment costs were $ 7.8 million (2022: $3.8 million).\n3.6. Contingent consideration on disposals\nIncluded within the assessment of recoverable value for impairment purposes of assets held for sale related\nto the sale of the J.A. Martin ex-solar business, as at June 30, 2022, were estimates of the contingent\nconsideration included within the sale agreement. The contingent consideration receivable 12 months\nfollowing sale, is based on a multiple of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of the\nbusiness. The fair value of contingent consideration of $4.5 million applied a contracted 4.5x multiple to year\n1 forecast EBITDA of AUD$2.7 million, less purchase price paid, discounted at 10% to net present value, less\npurchase price paid. Final settlement of the contingent consideration was paid in August 2023, and the\nreceivable amount and loss on disposal adjusted accordingly.\n3.7. Income taxes\nIn recognizing income tax assets and liabilities, management makes estimates of the likely outcome of\ndecisions by tax authorities on transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain. Where\nthe outcome of such matters is different, or expected to be different, from previous assessments made by\nmanagement, a change to the carrying value of the income tax assets and liabilities will be recorded in the\nperiod in which such determination is made. The carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities are\ndisclosed separately in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\nPage | 66\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\n3.8. Deferred tax assets\nDeferred tax assets for unused tax losses amounting to $4.3 million at June 30, 2023 (June 30, 2022: $4.1\nmillion; June 30, 2021: $1.9 million) are recognized to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable\nprofit will be available against which the losses can be utilized. Management judgement is required to\ndetermine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the likely timing and level\nof future taxable profits. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from\nestimates, the ability of the Company to realize the deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date could\nbe impacted.\n3.9. Exchangeable preference shares and exchangeable notes\nAs part of the IPO listing process VivoPower acquired Aevitas. The instruments previously issued by Aevitas\nwere restructured to become exchangeable into VivoPower shares. The Company considered IAS 32\nparagraph 16 in determining the accounting treatment. The Company has determined the instruments to be\ntreated as equity under the “fixed-for-fixed” rule meaning that both the amount of consideration\nreceived/receivable and the number of equity instruments to be issued must be fixed for the instrument to\nbe classified as equity. Both elements are satisfied within the instruments.\nWhilst the majority of the Aevitas exchangeable preference shares and exchangeable notes were converted\ninto Ordinary Shares in VivoPower in July 2021 a minority of investors in the instruments elected to accept\nnew Aevitas Preference Shares. The Company considered IAS 32 paragraph 16 in determining the accounting\ntreatment, and has determined the new Aevitas Preference Shares instruments should be treated as equity.\n3.10. Fair value measurement\nThe fair values of financial assets and liabilities recorded in the statement of financial position are measured\nusing valuation techniques including discounted cash flow (DCF) models. The inputs to these models are\ntaken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is\nrequired in establishing fair values. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported\nfair value. When the fair values of non-financial assets/CGUs need to be determined, for example in business\ncombinations and for impairment testing purposes, they are measured using valuation techniques including\nthe DCF model.\n4. Revenue and segmental information\nThe Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is provided internally\nto the board of directors of the Company (the \"Board\"), which is the Group’s chief operating decision maker.\nManagement analyzes our business in five reportable segments: Critical Power Services, Electric Vehicles,\nSustainable Energy Solutions, Solar Development and Corporate Office. Critical Power Services is\nrepresented by VivoPower’s wholly owned subsidiary Aevitas. In turn, Aevitas wholly owns Kenshaw Solar\nPty Ltd (previously J.A. Martin) (“Aevitas Solar”) and Kenshaw Electrical Pty Limited (“Kenshaw”), both of\nwhich operate in Australia with a focus on the design, supply, installation and maintenance of critical power,\ncontrol and distribution systems, including for solar farms. Electric Vehicles is represented by Tembo e-LV\nB.V. (“Tembo”), a Netherlands-based specialist battery-electric and off-road vehicle company delivering\nelectric vehicles (“EV”) for mining and other rugged industrial customers globally. Sustainable Energy\nSolutions (“SES”) is the design, evaluation, sale and implementation of renewable energy infrastructure to\ncustomers, both on a standalone basis and in support of Tembo EVs. Solar Development is represented by\nCaret and comprises 12 solar projects in the United States. Corporate Office is the Company’s corporate\nfunctions, including costs to maintain the Nasdaq public company listing, comply with applicable SEC\nreporting requirements, and related investor relations and is located in the U.K.\nPage | 67\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nAn operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may\nearn revenues and incur expenses, including any revenues and expenses that relate to the transactions with\nany of the Group’s other components. Operating segments results are reviewed regularly by the Board to\nassess its performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment, and for which\ndiscrete financial information is available.\nSegment results that are reported to the Board include items directly attributable to a segment as well as\nthose that can be allocated to a segment on a reasonable basis.\n4.1.

The recoverable amount of the Cash\nGenerating Unit (“CGU”) to which goodwill has been allocated is determined from value in use calculations.\nThe key assumptions in the calculations are the discount rates applied, expected operating margin levels\nand long-term growth rates. Management estimates discount rates that reflect the current market\nassessments while margins and growth rates are based upon approved budgets and related projections.\nThe Group prepares cash flow forecasts using the approved budgets for the coming fiscal year and\nmanagement projections for the following two years. Cash flows are also projected for subsequent years as\nmanagement believe that the investment is held for the long term. These budgets and projections reflect\nmanagement’s view of the expected market conditions and the position of the CGU’s products and services\nwithin those markets.\nThe CGU represented by Aevitas (being Critical Power Services) was assessed to have a value in excess of its\ncarrying value and hence no additional adjustments to goodwill were considered necessary. Key\nassumptions used in the assessment of impairment were discount rate based on the weighted average cost\nof capital of 12% (June 30, 2022: 11%; June 30, 2021: 10%) and annual growth rate of 3% per annum.\nThe solar element of the CGU represented by VivoPower Pty Ltd goodwill was assessed to have a value in\nexcess of its carrying value and hence no additional adjustments to goodwill were considered necessary. Key\nassumptions used in the assessment of impairment were weighted average cost of capital of 11.3% (June\n30, 2022: 11.3%, June 30, 2021: 10.7%), an average annual growth rate in years 2-5 of 60% during the rapid\ngrowth phase of the business, with the assumption that an average of 50% of electric light vehicles sold by\nthe Company in fleet sizes over 50 vehicles will be sold with an additional sustainable energy solution.\nThe CGU represented by Tembo e-LV and subsidiaries was assessed to have a value in excess of its carrying\nvalue. Key assumptions used in the assessment of impairment were discount rate based on the weighted\naverage cost of capital of 12% (June 30, 2022: 11%) and average annual growth rate of 33% per annum in\nyears 2-5 (June 30, 2022: 280% per annum in years 1-5). Growth rates reflect commencement of planned\nseries production at volume during the 5 year period, as the product development project is completed for\nthe current variant, to meet customer demand per sales agreements of over 15,000 units with major\ninternational distribution partners, including Acces, Bodiz and GHH. No sensitivity analysis is provided as the\nCompany expects no foreseeable changes in the assumptions that would result in impairment of the\ngoodwill.\nThe CGU represented by Caret solar projects was assessed to have a value in excess of its carrying value and\nhence no adjustments to capitalized development costs were considered necessary.

Investments accounted for using the equity method\nIn April 2017, the Company entered into a 50% joint venture with an early-stage solar development company,\nISS, to develop a diversified portfolio of 38 utility-scale solar projects in 9 different states, representing a total\nelectricity generating capacity of approximately 1.8 gigawatts, through an investment entity called Caret, LLC\n(the “ISS Joint Venture”).\nUnder the terms of the ISS Joint Venture, the Company committed to invest $14.1 million in the ISS Joint\nVenture for its 50% equity interest, after reducing the commitment by $0.8 million in potential brokerage\ncommissions that have not been required and which have been credited towards the Company’s\ncommitment. The $14.1 million commitment was allocated to each of the projects based on monthly capital\ncontributions determined with reference to completion of specific project development milestones under\nan approved development budget for the ISS Joint Venture. To June 29, 2021, the Company contributed\n$13.1 million of the $14.1 million commitment to the ISS Joint Venture, leaving a remaining capital\ncommitment at June 30, 2021, of $1.1 million, which was recorded in trade and other payables. 20 projects\nwithin the portfolio were discontinued in the year ended June 30, 2021, resulting in a write off of capitalized\ncosts of $7.0 million related to those projects.\nThe joint venture was accounted for as an investment under the equity method at March 31, 2018. During\nthe year ended March 31, 2019, the Company made the decision to sell its portfolio of solar projects held\nwithin the ISS Joint Venture, and the Joint Venture assets were reclassified as assets held for sale. In the year\nended June 30, 2020, sale of the entire portfolio was not successful, and the Company commenced a process\nto take control of the portfolio from the Joint Venture partner, which was expected to result in a slower\nproject realization timeframe. Accordingly, the portion of the investment that was expected to be realized in\nnear term sales within 12 months remained in assets held for sale, whereas the remainder of the portfolio\nwas reclassified back to investments accounted for under the equity method.\nOn June 30, 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 50% of Caret from ISS, for a consideration of $1.\nAccordingly, the book value of $8.1 million of the investments accounted for using the equity method have\nbeen derecognized upon acquisition, and the fair value of 100% of the consolidated capitalized project\ndevelopment costs recorded as an intangible asset upon acquisition, as detailed in Note 12b.\nPage | 87\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nReconciliation of the ISS Joint Venture investment is as follows:\nAs at 30 June\n(US dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nCapital commitment - - -\nCommission credit - - -\nDiscontinued projects - - -\nAcquisition costs - - -\nTotal - - -\nAllocation of the net book value of the equity accounted investment in the ISS Joint Venture, between current\nassets held for sale, and non-current investments (as disclosed in Note 16), until acquisition and\nconsolidation on 30 June 2021, was as follows:\nAs at 30 June\n(US dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nAssets classified as held for sale - - -\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method - - -\nTotal - - -\nThe table below provides summarized financial information for the ISS Joint Venture.

The main\npurpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Group’s funding and liquidity requirements. The\nGroup also has other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly\nfrom its operations.\nThe Group is exposed through its operations to the following financial risks:\n• Liquidity risk\n• Credit risk\n• Interest rate risk\n• Foreign currency risk\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk\nmanagement framework. Policy for managing risks is set by the Chief Executive Officer and is implemented\nby the Group’s finance department. All risks are managed centrally with a tight control of all financial matters.\n(b) Capital risk\nThe Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going\nconcern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, while protecting\nand strengthening the Group balance sheet through the appropriate balance of debt and equity funding.\nThe Group manages its capital structure (net debt plus equity) and makes adjustments to it in light of\nchanges to economic conditions and the strategic objectives of the Group either through the issuance of\nnew shares, capital raisings or borrowing facilities to meet the requirements of each local business.\nRefer to Note 26 for the Group statement of changes in equity for the value of the Group’s equity.\n(c) Liquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The\nGroup considers that liquidity risk is effectively managed and mitigated. The Group held unrestricted cash\nresources of $0.6 million at June 30, 2023 (June 30, 2022: $1.3m; June 30, 2021: $8.6m). The ratio of current\nassets to current liabilities at June 30, 2023 is 0.54 (June 30, 2022: 0.93; June 30, 2021: 1.82).\nFollowing sale of ex-solar J.A. Martin operations on July 1, 2022, the A$2.1 million J.A. Martin debtor finance\nfacility (drawn down at June 30, 2022: nil; June 30, 2021: nil) was cancelled and a new facility with a limit of\nA$2.5 million and variable interest rate that is currently 7.75% was established by Kenshaw, as well as a trade\nfinance facility of $0.5 million.\nThe Group maintains near-term cash flow forecasts that enable it to identify its borrowings requirement so\nthat remedial action can be taken if necessary.\nContractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments, are as follows:\nYear ended 30 June 2023 Less than 1-3 3-5 More than 5\n(US dollars in thousands) Total 1 year years years years\nContractual maturity of financial liabilities\nTrade and other payables (financial liabilities) 16,029 16,029 - - -\nBorrowings 30,083 1,922 12,323 8,447 7,391\nLease liabilities 2,305 462 1,375 415 53\nTotal 48,417 18,413 13,698 8,862 7,444\nPage | 104\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\nYear ended 30 June 2022 Less than 1-3 3-5 More than 5\n(US dollars in thousands) Total 1 year years years years\nContractual maturity of financial liabilities\nTrade and other payables (financial liabilities) 10,973 10,973 - - -\nBorrowings 26,097 4,604 11,283 10,211 -\nLease liabilities 2,464 506 846 1,112 -\nTotal 39,534 16,083 12,129 11,323 -\nYear ended 30 June 2021 Less than 1-3 3-5 More than\n(US dollars in thousands) Total 1 year years years 5 years\nContractual maturity of financial liabilities\nTrade and other payables (financial liabilities) 5,751 5,751 - - -\nBorrowings 22,096 411 11,424 10,261 -\nLease liabilities 995 669 326 - -\nTotal 28,842 6,831 11,750 10,261 -\n(d) Credit risk\nThe primary risk arises from the Group’s receivables from customers and contract assets. The majority of the\nGroup’s customers are long standing and have been a customer of the Group for many years. Losses have\noccurred infrequently. The Group is mainly exposed to credit risks from credit sales, but the Group has no\nsignificant concentrations of credit risk and keeps the credit status of customers under review. Credit risks of\ncustomers of new customers are reviewed before entering into contracts. The debtor exposure is monitored\nby Group finance and the local entities review and report their exposure on a monthly basis.\nThe Group does not consider the exposure to the above risks to be significant and has therefore not\npresented a sensitivity analysis on the identified risks.\nThe credit quality of debtors neither past due nor impaired is good. Refer to Note 19 for further analysis on\ntrade receivables.\n(e) Foreign currency risk\nThe Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk on sales and purchases that are\ndenominated in currencies other than the respective functional currencies of the Group entities to which\nthey relate, primarily between USD, AUD, EUR and GBP.\nThe Group’s investments in overseas subsidiaries are not hedged as those currency positions are either USD\ndenominated and/or considered to be long-term in nature.\nThe Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk on the following balances at 30 June 2023:\n• Cash and cash equivalents $0.54 million denominated in AUD, $0.02 million denominated in EUR and\n($0.03) million denominated in GBP.\n• Restricted cash $0.6 million denominated in AUD.\n• Trade and other receivables $3.4 million denominated in AUD, $1.0 million denominated in EUR and\n$2.6 million denominated in GBP.\n• Trade and other payables $5.0 million denominated in AUD, $2.0 million in EUR and $2.7 million in\nGBP.\nPage | 105\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nVivoPower International PLC for the year ended 30 June 2023\n• Borrowings $2.9 million denominated in AUD and $0.9 million in EUR.\n• Provisions $0.7 million denominated in AUD and $1.2 million in GBP.\nOf the total shareholder loan of $28.6 million, $27.1 million is denominated in USD and $1.5 million is\ndenominated in AUD.\n(f) Interest rate risk\nAs a result of the related party loan agreement the Group is exposed to interest rate volatility. However, the\ninterest rate is fixed for the medium term, therefore, the risk is largely mitigated for the near future. The Group\nwill continue to monitor the movements in the wider global economy.\n31. Related party transactions\nAWN is not the ultimate controlling party of VivoPower, but retains a significant influence. As at June 30, 2023,\nAWN held a 39.5% equity interest in the Company.\nKevin Chin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of VivoPower, is also Chief Executive of AWN.

Under the agreement, Tembo will develop and supply EUV electrification kits for\na new generation of electric jeepneys. One of the country’s cultural icons, jeepneys are the most common\nutility vehicle in the Philippines and the main mode of public transportation, accounting for just over 40% of\npublic transportation in the country. There are more than 200,000 jeepneys on the road in the Philippines, of\nwhich more than 90% are at least 15 years old and running on second-hand diesel engines. Under the Public\nUtility Vehicle Modernization Program, the Philippine Government requires that all jeepneys and other public\nutility vehicles with at least 15 years of service be replaced with Euro 4-compliant or electric-powered\nvehicles. This creates a US$10bn+ addressable market for the replacement of the old jeepneys. Francisco\nMotors and Tembo have already secured their first orders and have commenced work to deliver on those\norders. The agreement will also give Tembo access to low-cost assembly in the Philippines.\n33. Key management personnel compensation\nKey management personnel, which are those roles that have a Group management aspect to them are\nincluded in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.\n34. Ultimate controlling party\nAs at June 30, 2023, AWN held a 39.5% equity interest in the Company. Since June 30, 2021, the Company\nno longer has an ultimate controlling party.\nIn prior periods, the ultimate controlling party and the results into which these financials were consolidated\nwas AWN, a company registered in Australia.\nKey management personnel, which are those roles that have a Group management aspect to them, are\nincluded in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.\n35. Prior year adjustments\nFor the year ended 30 June, 2022, $0.5 million of expenses were erroneously not booked until 2023 that\nrelated to services provided in the year end 30 June 2022 for which no accruals had been created. These\nexpenses included $0.4 million professional services but also included $0.1 million equity incentives. The\nimpact was a reduction in the profit and loss of $0.5 million, a $0.4 million increase current liabilities and\n$0.1 million increase in equity accounts.\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021, $0.5 million of deposits had been incorrectly classified as intangible\nassets for which these deposits were refunded in the year ended 30 June 2023. The reclassification resulted\nin current assets increasing by $0.5 million and an opposite reduction in long term assets with no impact\non profit and loss or gross assets.\nFor the years ended 30 June, 2022 and 30 June, 2021, it was noted that $0.4 million of inventory had\nincorrectly been classified within other receivables.

For a reconciliation\nof Group Adjusted (Underlying) EPS (“Earnings per Share”) to Basic EPS, see slide 8.\n1\nExecutive Summary | Improved group EBITDA & EPS loss per share, strong Tembo momentum\nRevenue • Full-year revenue1 decreased by $7.4m or 33% year-on-year (“y-o-y”) to $15.1m. This was primarily attributable to delays in project delivery across\nAevitas Solar & Kenshaw Critical Power, consistent Tembo revenues and the effect of FX rates\n• On a constant AUD/USD FX rate basis, revenue decreased y-o-y by $6.2m or 28% to $16.2m\nGross Profit • Gross profit1 (“GP”) decreased by $2.5m y-o-y to a $(2.3)m, including $(3.9)m of specific “black swan” weather driven cost overruns on the Edenvale\nsolar project (due to once in a generation rainfall leading to damage of completed project works and delays in execution), having a more significant\nimpact than COVID-19 lockdowns and impact on supply chain in the prior year. Excluding one-off cost overruns, GP was $1.6m\n• GP margin declined to (15)% versus 1% for FY2022. However, GP margin adjusted for one-off cost overruns increased to 10.5% in FY2023, from 9.5% in\nthe prior year, reflecting increased focus on high margin service revenues in Kenshaw Critical Power business unit\n• Adjusted EBITDA1,2 loss improved by 37% to $(5.7)m versus $(9.1)m in the prior year, operating loss for continuing operations improved to $(11.3)m\nEBITDA & EPS\nversus $(14.5)m for FY22. Loss due to FX, reduced revenues in Australia, Edenvale solar project weather driven cost overruns and fiscal provisions\n• Adjusted EPS loss reduced by 37% to ($0.58) per share from ($0.92) per share; basic EPS loss also improved to ($0.82) from ($1.03) loss\nCash Balance • Cash balance decreased from $1.3m as of June 30, 2022 to $0.6m as of June 30, 2023. On a pro-forma basis, inclusive of earnout proceeds from the\nJ.A. Martin ex-solar sale, initial cash investment received from UAE private investment office and loans from AWN Holdings, cash balance was $2.8m\n• Balance sheet was also partly de-risked through extension of principal repayment and deferred interest payment date on AWN Holdings (\"AWN\")\nloans to 1 April 2025\n• Cash invested during FY23 was primarily for Tembo R&D, testing and production readiness\n• Tembo increased order and commitment book by 160% from 5,000 kits to 13,000 kits (excluding MOUs) during FY2023\nKey Strategic Developments\n• Tembo upscaled engineering team in the Netherlands, UK and Australia, doubling cumulative direct EV experience to over 100 years\n• Strategic direct investment into Tembo secured reflecting a $120m pre-money valuation\n• Post balance date, Tembo has entered into a definitive JV agreement with E-Francisco Motors (Francisco) to electrify the iconic jeepneys of the\nPhilippines. Francisco has a pipeline of 37,000 jeepneys for which Tembo will provide the EV drivetrains\nNotes:\n(1) Revenue, gross profit, operating losses and EBITDA refer to continuing operations only\n(2) For reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to IFRS net loss, see page 7. 2\nFY23 Key Developments | Significant strategic & operational progress for Tembo\nKey achievements included securing strategic investment from UAE and definitive agreements with ETC, Ulti-Mech and Fourche Maline\nDate Announced Comments & Updates\nSale of JA Martin ex-Solar J.A.

This was primarily attributable to delays in project delivery across\nAevitas Solar & Kenshaw Critical Power, consistent Tembo revenues and the effect of FX rates\n• On a constant AUD/USD FX rate basis, revenue decreased y-o-y by $6.2m or 28% to $16.2m\nGross Profit • Gross profit1 (“GP”) decreased by $2.5m y-o-y to a $(2.3)m, including $(3.9)m of specific “black swan” weather driven cost overruns on the Edenvale\nsolar project (due to once in a generation rainfall leading to damage of completed project works and delays in execution), having a more significant\nimpact than COVID-19 lockdowns and impact on supply chain in the prior year. Excluding one-off cost overruns, GP was $1.6m\n• GP margin declined to (15)% versus 1% for FY2022. However, GP margin adjusted for one-off cost overruns increased to 10.5% in FY2023, from 9.5% in\nthe prior year, reflecting increased focus on high margin service revenues in Kenshaw Critical Power business unit\n• Adjusted EBITDA1,2 loss improved by 37% to $(5.7)m versus $(9.1)m in the prior year, operating loss for continuing operations improved to $(11.3)m\nEBITDA & EPS\nversus $(14.5)m for FY22. Loss due to FX, reduced revenues in Australia, Edenvale solar project weather driven cost overruns and fiscal provisions\n• Adjusted EPS loss reduced by 37% to ($0.58) per share from ($0.92) per share; basic EPS loss also improved to ($0.82) from ($1.03) loss\nCash Balance • Cash balance decreased from $1.3m as of June 30, 2022 to $0.6m as of June 30, 2023.
