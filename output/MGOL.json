The first half of the year has been an exceptionally busy period during which time we have successfully achieved numerous critical objectives.\"In June 2024, we entered into a strategic business combination agreement with Heidmar, Inc. (\"Heidmar\"), a global, asset-light tanker pool, commercial and technical management company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and headquartered in Greece. We believe this transaction provides a compelling and potentially transformative opportunity for our fellow MGO shareholders. The fundamental strength of Heidmar's business plan, historical financial performance including net income of $19.6 million for fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, growth outlook and respected reputation in the global maritime industry, matched with the proven experience of Heidmar's leadership team, should serve as force multipliers for attaining potentially significant value creation for MGO's shareholders in the months and years to come.\"\"MGO is very proud of our efforts to establish _Stand Flagpoles_ as a respected niche digital brand which has continued to deliver solid performance since we first launched the patriotic-themed brand in March of 2023. It serves as a great example of MGO's approach to brand building and the strength of our digital commerce platform.\"In March of this year, we assigned all of MGO's rights and obligations under our global license agreement with Leo Messi Management to Centric Brands LLC, a global leading lifestyle brand collective, in a transaction that resulted in Centric paying MGO $2,000,000 in cash and assuming the obligation to pay 1.5 million Euros in aggregate royalty payments to Leo Messi Management in accordance with the terms and conditions of the license agreement. We are incredibly proud of our team's diligent efforts over the past several years, as they were behind making the _Messi Brand_ a reality and a valued asset in MGO's portfolio of brands. We believe that our decision to enter into the transaction with Centric was the right business decision for our Company and the brand, as Centric has the deep resources necessary to take the _Messi Brand_ to the next level.Concluding, Ojeda added, \"As we advance the business combination process with Heidmar towards our goal of closing in the second half of 2024, we look forward to what promises to be a very exciting future.\"Interim consolidated financial statements as of, and for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, are not yet complete and are not available as of the date of this press release.

Upon completion of the proposed transaction, the combined company will operate under the Heidmar name and be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \"HMAR.\"**Key Highlights**\n\n  * Heidmar is a single platform aggregator of maritime services for the tanker and dry bulk industry with unique and proven asset light business model\n  * Strong cash position and no debt provides high flexibility for future growth\n  * Heidmar has an established and diversified customer base leading to net income of $19.6 million for fiscal year ended December 31, 2023\n  * Predictable fee-based earnings to further mitigate freight rate exposure\n  * Heidmar anticipates being a dividend paying company post-closing of the proposed transaction\n  * Transaction to be completed at a significant premium to MGO's current stock price\n\nHeidmar has been recognized for its commitment to excellence in commercial management, chartering and asset management advisory services. It offers broad services to shipowners, including tanker pool management, commercial management and time charter trading and is actively expanding into dry bulk pool management, vessel sale and purchase services and technical management services, including environmental compliance.

Having profitably grown Heidmar's revenues ten-fold, from $5 million in 2021 to nearly $50 million in 2023, we also generated net income of $19.6 million in 2023 leading to approximately 40% net margins. Heidmar has established a sound foundation that is expected to effectively support substantial future growth through diligent execution of our business expansion strategies. I am very proud of what the Heidmar Team has achieved since we assumed leadership of the Company in 2020 and look forward to leveraging the Heidmar brand and relationships built over the last four decades to fuel further growth. Heidmar has a critical role to play in the decarbonization of the shipping industry by providing operational and technical measures to our clients to reduce CO2 emissions.\"**Transaction Overview** The transaction will be effectuated through a holding company structure, whereby MGO and Heidmar will each become wholly-owned subsidiaries of a newly incorporated Marshall Islands company (\"PubCo\").

All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this press release, including statements regarding PubCo's, MGO Global's or Heidmar's future results of operations and financial position, PubCo's, MGO's and Heidmar's business strategy, prospective costs, timing and likelihood of success, plans and objectives of management for future operations, future results of current and anticipated operations of PubCo, MGO and Heidmar, and the expected value of the combined company after the transactions, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words \"believe,\" \"project,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"strategy,\" \"future,\" \"opportunity,\" \"plan,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"will be,\" \"will continue,\" \"will likely result,\" and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, but not limited to, the following risks relating to the proposed transaction: the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the transaction agreement; the risk that the transaction may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, which may adversely affect the price of MGO's securities; the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the transaction agreement; the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the transaction agreement, including due to failure to obtain approval of the shareholders of MGO or other conditions to closing in the transaction agreement; the inability to obtain or maintain the listing of PubCo ordinary shares on Nasdaq following the transaction; the risk that the transactions disrupt current plans and operations of MGO as a result of the announcement and consummation of the transactions; the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the transactions, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the combined company to grow and manage growth economically and hire and retain key employees; costs related to the transactions; changes in applicable laws or regulations; the possibility that PubCo, Heidmar or MGO may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; and other risks and uncertainties to be identified in the proxy statement/prospectus (when available) relating to the transactions, including those under \"Risk Factors\" therein, and in other filings with the SEC made by PubCo and MGO. Moreover, PubCo, Heidmar and MGO operate in very competitive and rapidly changing environments. Because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and some of which are beyond PubCo's, Heidmar's and MGO's control, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and except as required by law, PubCo, Heidmar and MGO assume no obligation and do not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

(the \"Company”, \"we”, or \"our”) is offering on a best-efforts basis up to 2,100,840 shares of its common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the \"Common Stock”), at an assumed public offering price of $2.38 per share, based upon the last reported sale price of our Common Stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market on November 19, 2024.\n\nWe are also offering to those purchasers, if any, whose purchase of Common Stock in this offering would otherwise result in the purchaser, together with its affiliates and certain related parties, beneficially owning more than 4.99% (or, at the election of the purchaser, 9.99%) of our outstanding Common Stock immediately following the consummation of this offering, the opportunity to purchase, if the purchaser so chooses, pre-funded warrants to purchase Common Stock (each a \"Pre-funded Warrant”) at an exercise price of $0.00001 per share. The purchase price of each Pre-funded Warrant is equal to the price per share of Common Stock being sold to the public in this offering, minus $0.00001. The Pre-funded Warrants will be immediately exercisable and may be exercised at any time until all of the Pre-funded Warrants are exercised in full. For each Pre-funded Warrant that we sell, the number of shares of Common Stock that we are offering will be decreased on a one-for-one basis.\n\nOur Common Stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \"MGOL.” The last reported sale price of our Common Stock on Nasdaq on November 19, 2024 was $2.38 per share. There is no established trading market for the Pre-funded Warrants and we do not intend to list the Pre-funded Warrants on any securities exchange or nationally recognized trading system.\n\nThe Common Stock and Pre-funded Warrants, if any, will be offered at a fixed price and are expected to be issued in a single closing. There is no minimum number of securities or minimum aggregate amount of proceeds for this offering to close. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the shares of our Common Stock underlying any Pre-funded Warrants will be offered on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We expect this offering to be completed not later than one business day following the commencement of sales in this offering (after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part) and we will deliver all securities to be issued in connection with this offering delivery versus payment or receipt versus payment, as the case may be, upon receipt of investor funds received by us. Accordingly, neither we nor the placement agent have made any arrangements to place investor funds in an escrow account or trust account since the placement agent will not receive investor funds in connection with the sale of the securities offered hereunder.\n\nWe have engaged Maxim Group LLC (the \"placement agent” or \"Maxim”), to act as our exclusive placement agent in connection with this offering. The placement agent has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit offers to purchase the securities offered by this prospectus. The placement agent is not purchasing or selling any of the securities we are offering, and the placement agent is not required to arrange the purchase or sale of any specific number or dollar amount of securities. Because there is no minimum offering amount required as a condition to closing in this offering, the actual offering amount, placement agent’s fee and proceeds to us, if any, are not presently determinable and may be substantially less than the total maximum offering amounts described throughout this prospectus. We have agreed to pay the placement agent, the placement agent fees set forth in the table below and to provide certain other compensation to the Placement Agent. See \"Plan of Distribution” for more information regarding these arrangements.\n\n**Investing in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. See \"_Risk Factors_ ” beginning on page 8 of this prospectus for a discussion of information that should be considered in connection with an investment in our Common Stock.**\n\n**NEITHER THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED THESE SECURITIES OR DETERMINED IF THIS PROSPECTUS IS TRUTHFUL OR COMPLETE.

Industry surveys, publications and forecasts generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed. To our knowledge, certain third-party industry data that includes projections for future periods does not consider potential geoeconomic inflationary pressures. Accordingly, those third-party projections may be overstated and should not be given undue weight. We have not independently verified any of the data from third party sources, nor have we ascertained the underlying economic assumptions relied upon therein. Similarly, internal surveys, industry forecasts and market research, which we believe to be reliable based on our management’s knowledge of the industry, have not been independently verified. Forecasts are particularly likely to be inaccurate, especially over long periods of time. In addition, we do not necessarily know what assumptions regarding general economic growth were used in preparing the forecasts we cite. Statements as to our market position are based on the most currently available data. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the industry data presented in this prospectus, our estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under the heading \"_Risk Factors_ ” in this prospectus.\n\n**PROSPECTUS SUMMARY**\n\n_This summary provides a brief overview of the key aspects of our business and our securities. The reader should read the entire prospectus carefully, especially the risks of investing in our Common Stock discussed under \"Risk Factors.” Some of the statements contained in this prospectus, including statements under \"Summary” and \"Risk Factors,” as well as those noted in the documents incorporated herein by reference, are forward-looking statements and may involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and future events may differ significantly based upon a number of factors. The reader should not put undue reliance on the forward-looking statements in this document, which speak only as of the date on the cover of this prospectus._\n\n**Business Overview**\n\nFounded in October 2018 and headquartered in Florida with remote employees and specialty contractors in London, New York and Latin America, we have built a brand acceleration platform with a focus on the acquisition, optimization and monetization of consumer brands across multiple categories. Our mission is to provide customers with unmatched variety, quality and shopping experience, while adding considerable value for MGO’s shareholders.\n\nOur accomplished leadership team encompasses decades of experience in building successful global lifestyle brands, including fashion design, marketing, technology, corporate finance and branding. We strive to continually push innovation and evolution of the consumer product cycle without compromising quality and design integrity. Through our end-to-end, scalable brand-building platform, backed by robust consumer behavioral data, we are engaged in nurturing digitally native brands that will thrive in the modern Direct to Consumer (\"DTC”) economy.\n\nIn 2018, we signed a global licensing agreement with, Leo Messi Management SA (\"LMM”), soccer legend Lionel Messi’s licensing and management company and created the \"Messi Brand” – a line of casual wear and accessories inspired by his trend-setting style and offered on The Messi Store (www.themessistore.com). Designed by the Company’s co-founder and Chief Brand Officer, Virginia Hilfiger, the _Messi Brand_ ’s DNA is rooted in Messi’s personal style and emphasizes accessibility, comfort and ease.\n\n2  \n---  \n  \nIn March 2024, we assigned our global licensing agreement with LMM (\"LMM License Agreement”) to Centric Brands, LLC (\"Centric”). Centric is a global leading lifestyle brand collective that has expertise in product design, development and sourcing; retail and digital commerce; marketing and brand building. Centric designs, sources, markets, and sells high-quality products in the kid’s, men’s and women’s apparel, accessories, beauty, and entertainment categories. The company’s portfolio includes licenses for more than 100 iconic brands, including Calvin Klein®, Tommy Hilfiger®, Nautica®, Spyder®, and Under Armour® in the kid’s category; Joe’s Jeans®, Buffalo®, Hervé Léger®, and IZOD® in the men’s and women’s apparel category; Coach®, Kate Spade®, Michael Kors®, All Saints®, Frye®, Timberland®, Hunter®, and Jessica Simpson® in the accessories category; and in the entertainment category, Disney®, Marvel®, Nickelodeon®, and Warner Brothers® among many others. The company also owns and operates Zac Posen®, Hudson®, Robert Graham®, Avirex®, Fiorelli®, and Taste Beauty® and operates a joint venture brand, Favorite Daughter, with Sara and Erin Foster. The company’s products are sold through leading mass-market retailers, specialty and department stores and online. The company is headquartered in New York City with U.S. offices in Los Angeles and Greensboro, and international offices in Asia, Europe, Montreal and Toronto. In connection with the assignment of the LMM License Agreement, Centric paid MGO $2,000,000 in cash and assumed the obligation to pay €1,500,000 in aggregate royalty payments due to LMM in 2024.\n\nWhile the _Messi Brand_ was previously the only asset in our portfolio through early 2023, our business model has remained centered on strategic expansion through collaborations, licensing, acquisitions and organic development. As our brand portfolio expands, we intend to drive the commercial value of each brand through our own DTC platform methodologies, ensuring that each brand maintains its own unique identity while remaining thoughtfully aligned with the values of our customers.\n\nIn November 2022, we formed MGO Digital LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary which leverages data analytics, advanced technology-enabled marketing and our leadership team’s industry relationships and expertise to identify, incubate and introduce to market new, authentic brand concepts.\n\nIn March 2023, we obtained a royalty-free, worldwide and exclusive license to the assets of Stand CO, LLC, a DTC digitally native brand which offers a line of high quality, residential flagpoles, American flags, solar flagpole light kits, flagpole finials, patriotic-themed apparel and other products. _Stand Flagpoles_ brought to our brand portfolio immediate revenue generation and the opportunity to further demonstrate the benefits of its end-to-end, data-driven brand-building platform to help accelerate and optimize long-term growth. In late March 2023, the Company formed Americana Liberty, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary focused exclusively on supporting the new DTC flagpole and related product line.\n\n**Corporate Information**\n\nWe were incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 30, 2021. Our principal executive offices are located at 1515 SE 17th Street, Suite 121/#460236, Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33346 and our telephone number is 347-913-3316. Our corporate website address is _www.mgoglobalinc.com_. Information on or that can be accessed through our website is not part of this prospectus and should not be relied upon in determining whether to make an investment decision.\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\n**_Amendment to 2022 Equity Incentive Plan_**. On April 12, 2024, the Board unanimously authorized and approved an amendment (\"Plan Amendment”) to MGO’s 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2022 Plan”) to increase the number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock, par value $0.00001 per share, (\"Common Stock”) reserved for issuance under the 2022 Plan by an additional 1,825,413 shares of Common Stock. Such increase will result in a total of 4,511,883 shares of Common Stock being reserved under the 2022 Plan, of which 2,050,705 will be available for future awards. On April 17, 2024 (the \"Record Date”), a majority of our stockholders consented to the Plan Amendment.\n\n**_Reverse Stock Split._** On July 18, 2024, we effected a reverse stock split of our Common Stock at a ratio of 1:10 The reverse stock split did not affect MGO’s authorized shares of preferred and Common Stock, which remain at 20,000,000 and 150,000,000 shares, respectively. The par value of each share of preferred and Common Stock remains unchanged at $0.00001.\n\n**_Business Combination_** _._ On June 18, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive Business Combination Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Business Combination Agreement”) with Heidmar, Inc., (\"Heidmar”), a company organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Heidmar Maritime Holdings Corp., a company organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (\"Holdings”), and HMR Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings (\"Merger Sub”), and Rhea Marine Ltd. and Maistros Shipinvest Corp (the \"Heidmar Shareholders”).\n\n3  \n---  \n  \nPursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, the parties will effect a business combination involving the following transactions (collectively, the \"Business Combination”):\n\n(a) | Merger Sub will merge (the \"Merger”) with and into the MGO, with MGO continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings;  \n---|---  \n(b) | all of the issued and outstanding Common Stock prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into the right to receive common shares of Holdings (the \"Holdings Shares”) on a one-for-one basis at the Closing of the Business Combination;  \n(c) | immediately after the effective time of the Merger, the Heidmar Shareholders will transfer all of their outstanding shares of Common Stock of Heidmar to Holdings (the \"Heidmar Share Acquisition”), with Heidmar becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings; and  \n(d) | Holdings shall issue to the Heidmar Shareholders (i) at the closing of the Business Combination (the \"Closing”), a number of Holdings Shares equal to (x) the number of the Company’s outstanding shares of Common Stock on a fully diluted and as-converted basis immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, times (y) 16.6667 and (ii) after the Closing and upon the satisfaction of certain earnout conditions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement, additional Holdings Shares equal to 10% of the shares issued to the Heidmar Shareholders on the Closing, with 2.64% of each issuance being distributed to MGO’s financial advisor.  \n  \nFollowing the Closing, both MGO and Heidmar will be wholly owned subsidiaries of Holdings, and the Holdings Shares will be publicly listed on Nasdaq. The parties expect that after the Closing, the Heidmar Shareholders will own 94.34% of Holdings (including amounts to be distributed to MGO’s financial advisor), and the MGO stockholders will own 5.66% of Holdings, without taking into account the issuance of any Earnout Shares. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, any shares of common stock that MGO issues prior to the Closing will not change these percentages.\n\nOne of the conditions to the Closing is that Holdings is approved for listing on Nasdaq.\n\nThe Company has obtained an independent fairness opinion from Newbridge Securities Corporation dated June 18, 2024, which states that in the opinion of Newbridge Securities Corporation, based on Holdings having a value of $300 million, the number of Holdings Shares issued to the Company’s stockholders in exchange for their shares of MGO Common Stock is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company’s stockholders.\n\nOn August 22, 2024, Holdings confidentially submitted a Form F-4 Draft Registration Statement to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC”) and then submitted amendments to such draft registration statement on September 30, 2024 and November 15, 2024, for the purpose of soliciting the votes of the Company’s stockholders to approve the Merger and register the Holdings shares that will be issued to the Company’s stockholders and its financial advisor in connection with the Business Combination. For a more detailed description of the Business Combination and the associated risk factors see Exhibit 99.1 to the registration statement related to this prospectus and \"Risk Factors—Risks Associated with the Business Combination, Heidmar and Holdings.\n\n**FOR MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS COMBINATION, THE RISK FACTORS INVOLVED THEREIN, AND INFORMATION REGARDING HOLDINGS AND HEIDMAR, INCLUDING MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION ON HEIDMAR AND PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY AND HOLDINGS, PLEASE SEE EXHIBIT 99.1 AND EXHIBIT 99.2 TO THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT RELATED TO THIS PROSPECTUS.**\n\n**Summary Risk Factors**\n\nOur business is subject to a number of risks. You should be aware of these risks before making an investment decision. These risks are discussed more fully in the section of this prospectus titled \"_Risk Factors_ ,” which begins on page 8 of this prospectus, and include, among others, the following:\n\n● | The consummation of the Business Combination is subject to the closing conditions contained in the Business Combination Agreement and could be delayed or may never occur;  \n---|---  \n● | MGO and Heidmar will incur significant transaction and transition costs in connection with the Business Combination;  \n● | The announcement of the proposed Business Combination could disrupt Heidmar’s relationships with its customers, suppliers, business partners and others, as well as its operating results and business generally;

 \n● | The directors and officers of Holdings have not had experience managing a business like MGO’s and may not succeed in attracting capable managers, which could cause MGO’s business and financial condition to suffer;  \n● | The IRS may not agree that Holdings (i) should be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (ii) should not be treated as a \"surrogate foreign corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes;

  \n● | The requirements of being a public company may strain Holdings’ resources, divert Holdings management’s attention and affect Holdings’ ability to attract and retain qualified board members;   \n● | Future sales of Holdings Shares, including resales by the Heidmar Shareholders and other significant shareholders, may cause the market price of the Holdings Shares to drop significantly, even if Holdings’ business is doing well;  \n  \n5  \n---  \n  \n● | The market price of Holdings Shares may be volatile, and you may lose all or part of your investment;  \n---|---  \n● | Holdings is a holding company that depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute funds to it in order to satisfy its financial and other obligations;

MGO Stockholders cannot be sure that an active trading market will develop for the Holdings Shares, the market price they will receive or that Holdings will successfully obtain authorization for listing on the Nasdaq;  \n● | We have a history of operating losses and may continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We may not be able to generate sufficient net sales to achieve or maintain profitability. Failure to maintain an adequate growth rate will materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results;  \n● | Because we operate in an evolving industry, our past results may not be indicative of future performance, and our future performance may fluctuate materially which will increase your investment risk;  \n● | If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed;  \n● | Our sales may be adversely affected if we fail to respond to changes in consumer preferences in a timely manner or are not successful in expanding our product offerings;  \n● | Uncertainties in economic conditions and their impact on consumer spending patterns could adversely impact our operating results;  \n● | Failure of our vendors to supply high quality and compliant merchandise in a timely manner may damage our reputation and brand and harm our business;  \n● | Government regulation of the Internet and ecommerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and results of operations;  \n● | Our failure or the failure of third-party service providers to protect our site, networks and systems against security breaches, or otherwise to protect our confidential information, could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business and operating results;  \n● | If we lose any of our key management personnel, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives;  \n● | We may incur material losses and costs as a result of manufacturer’s product defects, warranty claims or product liability actions that may be brought against us;  \n● | The price of our Common Stock may rapidly fluctuate or may decline regardless of our operating performance, resulting in substantial losses for investors;  \n● | We are an \"emerging growth company” and a \"smaller reporting company” under the JOBS Act, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies will make our Common Stock less attractive to investors;  \n  \n6  \n---  \n  \n**SUMMARY OF THE OFFERING**\n\n_The following summary contains basic terms about this offering and the Common Stock and is not intended to be complete.

If any of the risks discussed in this prospectus occur, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, in which case the trading price of our Common Stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Some statements in this prospectus, including statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section entitled \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”_\n\n**Risks Related to the Business Combination**\n\n_As described under \"Prospectus Summary - Recent Developments”, the Company has entered into the Business Combination Agreement, which if approved by our stockholders and completed in accordance with its terms, the shares of the Company’s common stock will be cancelled and our former stockholders will receive common shares of Holdings.**The risks related to Heidmar and Holdings are described in Exhibit 99.1 to the Registration Statement which this prospectus forms a part.**_\n\n**_The consummation of the Business Combination is subject to the closing conditions contained in the Business Combination Agreement and could be delayed or may never occur._**\n\nThe consummation of the Business Combination is subject to the closing conditions contained in the Business Combination Agreement and could be delayed or may never occur. Accordingly, any shares of Common Stock of the Company (\"MGO Shares”) offered and purchased (including newly issued MGO Shares sold under MGO’s at-the-market program or through other capital raising activities) following the announcement of the Business Combination but prior to the Closing is an investment in the Company. The Business Combination is subject to the approval of the stockholders of MGO (the \"MGO Stockholders”), and while stockholders holding a majority of the issued and outstanding MGO Shares have agreed to vote to approve the Business Combination, it is possible that events could occur that would prevent this approval from being obtained. The closing conditions that must be satisfied or waived before the Closing can occur are specified in the Business Combination Agreement and include: (i) the representations and warranties of MGO, Heidmar and the Heidmar Shareholders being true and correct subject to the materiality standards contained in the Business Combination Agreement; (ii) material compliance by the parties of their respective pre-closing covenants and agreements, subject to the standards contained in the Business Combination Agreement; (iii) the absence of any Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) with respect to Heidmar since the effective date of the Business Combination Agreement that is continuing and uncured; (iv) the expiration or termination, as applicable, of any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Business Combination Agreement under any antitrust laws; (v) that no governmental authority of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted any law or order in effect at the time of Closing which has the effect of making the Business Combination or other ancillary Transactions illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Business Combination or ancillary Transactions; (vi) the Registration Statement (as defined below) being declared effective by the SEC; (vii) the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Holdings having been amended and restated as set forth in an exhibit to the Business Combination Agreement; (viii) the entry into certain ancillary agreements as of the Closing; (ix) the approval of the listing of the Holdings Shares on Nasdaq (or another national securities exchange), and (x) the receipt of certain closing deliverables. MGO and Heidmar may not satisfy all of the closing conditions in the Business Combination Agreement. If the closing conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Business Combination will not occur, or will be delayed pending later satisfaction or waiver, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\n\nFurther, the aggregate percentages of Holdings Shares to be issued to the holders of MGO Shares on one hand and the Heidmar Shareholders on the other immediately after the consummation of the Business Combination is fixed pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement. Accordingly, the issuance of new MGO Shares following announcement of the Business Combination Agreement, including through the Company’s at-the-market sales program or other capital raises, will not increase the aggregate ownership percentage of Holdings Shares to be issued to holders of MGO Shares following consummation of the Business Combination, but will dilute the Holdings ownership percentage that each individual holder of MGO Shares would receive.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \n**_MGO and Heidmar will incur significant transaction and transition costs in connection with the Business Combination._**\n\nMGO, Holdings and Heidmar have incurred and expect to incur significant, non-recurring costs in connection with consummating the Business Combination, including legal, accounting, consulting, investment banking and other fees, expenses and costs. In addition, Holdings will incur significant costs operating as a public company following the consummation of the Business Combination and may also incur additional costs to retain key employees. Generally, transaction expenses incurred in connection with the Business Combination will be paid by the party incurring those expenses, and many of those expenses might not be paid until after the Closing. Accordingly, these expenses could result in Holdings having less money following the Closing to spend on other aspects of its business, particularly if the actual expenses turn out to be higher than anticipated.\n\n**_Legal proceedings in connection with the Business Combination, the outcomes of which are uncertain, could delay or prevent the completion of the Business Combination._**\n\nIn connection with transactions like the proposed Business Combination, it is not uncommon for lawsuits to be filed against the parties and/or their respective directors and officers alleging, among other things, that the proxy statement/prospectus provided to shareholders contains false and misleading statements and/or omits material information concerning the transaction. Although no such lawsuits have yet been filed in connection with the Business Combination, it is possible that such actions may arise and, if they do arise, to seek, among other things, injunctive relief and an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses. Defending such lawsuits could require MGO, Heidmar and Holdings to incur significant costs and draw the attention of MGO’s and Heidmar’s management teams away from the consummation of the Business Combination and the management of their respective businesses. Further, the defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the Business Combination is consummated may adversely affect Holdings’ business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such legal proceedings could delay or prevent the Business Combination from being consummated within the expected timeframe.\n\n**_The announcement of the proposed Business Combination could disrupt Heidmar’s relationships with its customers, suppliers, business partners and others, as well as its operating results and business generally._**\n\nRisks relating to the announcement of the Business Combination on Heidmar’s business include the following:\n\n● | its employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles, which might adversely affect Heidmar’s ability to retain and hire key personnel and other employees;  \n---|---  \n● | customers, suppliers, business partners and other parties with which Heidmar maintains business relationships may experience uncertainty about its future and seek alternative relationships with third parties, seek to alter their business relationships with Heidmar or fail to extend an existing relationship with Heidmar; and  \n● | Heidmar has expended and will continue to expend significant costs, fees and expenses for professional services and transaction costs in connection with the proposed Business Combination.  \n  \nIf any of the aforementioned risks were to materialize, they could lead to significant costs which may impact Holdings’ results of operations and cash available to fund its business.\n\n**_After the Business Combination, Holdings may be exposed to unknown or contingent liabilities and may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on its financial condition, results of operations and share price._**\n\nIt is possible that the due diligence conducted in relation to Heidmar and MGO and their respective businesses did not identify all material issues or risks associated with these companies or the industries in which they compete.\n\nFurthermore, factors outside of the parties’ control could arise later. As a result of these factors, Holdings may be exposed to liabilities and incur additional costs and expenses and be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Even if the due diligence has identified certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with the parties’ preliminary risk analysis. If any of these risks materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on the Holdings’ financial condition and results of operations and could contribute to negative market perceptions about Holdings’ securities.\n\n**_Due to potential fluctuations in the market value of Holdings Shares, MGO Stockholders cannot be sure of the market value of the consideration that they will receive in the Business Combination._**\n\nAfter the Closing, the Heidmar Shareholders will own 94.34% of Holdings (including amounts to be distributed to MGO’s financial advisor), and the MGO Stockholders will own 5.66% of Holdings, without taking into account the issuance of any Earnout Shares (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement). Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, any MGO Shares that MGO issues prior to Closing will not change these percentages.\n\n9  \n---  \n  \nThe consideration that eligible MGO Stockholders will receive upon consummation of the Business Combination Agreement is one Holdings Common Share for each share of MGO Common Stock (an \"MGO Share”). In addition, the Heidmar Shareholders will receive, for each Heidmar Share, a number of Holdings Shares equal to (a) the MGO Shares outstanding at Closing, times (b) 16.6667, divided by (c) the outstanding shares of Heidmar. Prior to the Closing, there has not been and will not be an established public trading market for Holdings Shares. The market value of Holdings Shares will reflect the combination of MGO and Heidmar under the terms of the Business Combination. Further, the MGO Merger Consideration will not be adjusted to reflect any changes in the number of MGO Shares outstanding, the market value of MGO Shares or currency Exchange Rates.\n\nChanges in the price of MGO Shares may result from a variety of factors, including, among others, changes in MGO’s business, operations or prospects, regulatory considerations, governmental actions, legal proceedings and general business, market, industry, political or economic conditions. Many of these factors are beyond MGO’s control. As a result, the aggregate market value of the Holdings Shares that a MGO Stockholder is entitled to receive at the Closing could vary significantly from the value of the equivalent MGO Shares on the date of the Business Combination Agreement, the date of this proxy statement/prospectus or at other times, and MGO Stockholders will neither know nor be able to calculate the value of the MGO Merger Consideration they would receive upon the Closing. MGO Stockholders are urged to obtain current market quotations for MGO Shares.\n\n**_If the Business Combination is not completed by the Outside Date either MGO or Heidmar may have the right to terminate the Business Combination Agreement._**\n\nIf the conditions to the obligations of Heidmar and MGO to consummate the Business Combination Agreement are not satisfied or waived (if applicable) by December 31, 2024, either MGO or Heidmar may have the right to terminate the Business Combination Agreement. MGO or Heidmar may elect to terminate the Business Combination Agreement in certain other circumstances, including if the MGO Stockholders fail to approve the Transactions at their respective shareholder meetings, and MGO and Heidmar can mutually decide to terminate the Business Combination Agreement at any time prior to the Merger Effective Time, before or after the required MGO Stockholder Approval.\n\n**_The Business Combination Agreement contains restrictions on the ability of Heidmar and MGO to pursue alternatives to the Business Combination._**\n\nThe Business Combination Agreement contains provisions that may discourage a third party from submitting a competing business combination proposal that might result in greater value to the Heidmar Shareholders or the MGO Stockholders than the Business Combination. These provisions include, among others, a general prohibition on Heidmar and MGO from soliciting or entering into discussions with any third party regarding, among other things, any business combination proposal, during the Interim Period.\n\n**_Certain MGO Stockholders who hold a majority of the MGO Shares have entered into agreements to vote in favor of the Transactions._**\n\nCertain MGO Stockholders who are officers or directors of MGO and hold a majority of the MGO Shares (the \"MGO Principals”) have entered into Voting and Support Agreements with MGO, Heidmar and Holdings, pursuant to which they have agreed, among other things, to vote their MGO Shares in favor of all the proposals presented for approval by MGO’s shareholders in respect of the Business Combination, including voting in favor of the Business Combination and to approve the Business Combination Agreement and not to transfer his or her MGO Shares (subject to certain exceptions). Further, in the Business Combination Agreement, MGO has agreed to not issue new MGO Shares prior to the Record Date if that issuance would cause the portion of MGO Shares held by the MGO Principals to fall to 50% or less. Accordingly, the votes of the MGO Principals can ensure that MGO’s shareholders will approve the Business Combination even if the remaining MGO Stockholders vote against it or otherwise believe the Business Combination is not in their best interests.\n\nEven if the Business Combination Agreement is approved by the MGO Stockholders, closing of the Business Combination still requires that certain closing conditions be satisfied or waived. It is possible that MGO, Heidmar and/or Holdings will fail to satisfy one or more conditions and this failure may not be waived by the other parties. If the closing conditions are not satisfied or waived by the applicable parties, the Business Combination will not occur, or will be delayed pending later satisfaction or waiver, and such delay may cause MGO, Holdings or Heidmar to lose some or all of the intended benefits of the Business Combination.\n\nFurther, satisfying the conditions to, and the completion of, the Business Combination may take longer and could cost more than Heidmar and MGO expect. Any delay or additional costs incurred in connection with completing the Business Combination could materially affect the benefits that Heidmar and MGO expect to achieve from the Business Combination.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \n**_Termination of the Business Combination Agreement could negatively impact MGO and Heidmar._**\n\nIf the Business Combination is not completed for any reason, including as a result of MGO Stockholders declining to adopt the Business Combination Agreement or declining to approve the proposals required to effect the Business Combination, the ongoing businesses of MGO and Heidmar may be adversely impacted and, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Business Combination, MGO and Heidmar would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\n● | MGO may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on MGO’s stock price (including to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Business Combination will be completed);  \n---|---  \n● | Heidmar may experience negative reactions from its customers, vendors and employees;  \n● | MGO and Heidmar will have incurred substantial expenses and will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Business Combination, whether or not the Business Combination is completed; and  \n● | since the Business Combination Agreement restricts the conduct of MGO’s and Heidmar’s businesses prior to completion of the Business Combination, each of MGO and Heidmar may not have been able to take certain actions during the pendency of the Business Combination that would have benefitted it as an independent company, and the opportunity to take such actions may no longer be available.  \n  \n**_If the Business Combination is consummated, MGO Stockholders will experience immediate and material dilution._**\n\nAfter the Closing, the MGO Stockholders will own 5.66% of Holdings, and the Heidmar Shareholders will own 94.34% of Holdings (including amounts to be distributed to MGO’s financial advisor), without taking into account the issuance of any Earnout Shares. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, any MGO Shares that MGO issues prior to Closing will not change these percentages. As such, the MGO Stockholders will experience immediate and material dilution upon Closing.\n\n**_Holdings’ ability to be successful following the Business Combination will depend upon the efforts of the Heidmar’s officers and the loss of such persons could negatively impact the operations and profitability of the post-Business Combination business._**\n\nHoldings’ ability to be successful following the Business Combination will be dependent upon the efforts of the certain key personnel of Heidmar. Although the parties expect key personnel to remain with Holdings following the Business Combination, there can be no assurance that they will do so. It is possible that Heidmar will lose some key personnel, the loss of which could negatively impact the operations and profitability of Holdings. Furthermore, following the Closing, certain of the key personnel of Heidmar may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a company regulated by the SEC, which could cause Holdings to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements.\n\n**_The directors and officers of Holdings have not had experience managing a business like MGO’s and may not succeed in attracting capable managers, which could cause MGO’s business and financial condition to suffer._**\n\nNone of the officers and directors of MGO will remain as officers or directors of MGO following the Business Combination. The officers and directors of Holdings following the Business Combination will be determined by Heidmar and will consist primarily of officers and directors of Heidmar. Heidmar is a commercial manager of ocean-going transport vessels, which is a very different business from the business that MGO manages, which is to design, manufacture, license, distribute, advertise and sell a range of products. Holdings may fail to find and employ capable and experienced personnel to manage and operate MGO’s business upon the Closing. If so, MGO’s business and its financial condition could suffer.\n\n**Risks Related to U.S. Federal Income Taxation of the Business Combination**\n\n**_The IRS may not agree that Holdings (i) should be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (ii) should not be treated as a \"surrogate foreign corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes_** _._\n\nUnder current U.S. federal income tax law, a corporation generally will be considered to be a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes only if it is created or organized in the United States or under the law of the United States or of any State or the District of Columbia. Accordingly, under generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rules, Holdings, which is not created or organized in the United States or under the law of the United States or of any State but is instead a Republic of the Marshall Islands incorporated entity and a tax resident of Greece, would generally be classified as a non-U.S. corporation. Section 7874 of the Code, and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, however, contain specific rules that may cause a non-U.S. corporation to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If it were determined that Holdings is treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874 of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, Holdings would be liable for U.S. federal income tax on its income just like any other U.S. corporation and certain distributions made by Holdings to Non-U.S. holders (as defined in \"_Certain Tax Considerations—U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations_ ”) of Holdings would be subject to U.S. withholding tax. In addition, even if Holdings is not treated as a U.S. corporation, it may be subject to unfavorable treatment as a \"surrogate foreign corporation” in the event that ownership attributable to former MGO Stockholders exceeds a threshold amount. If it were determined that Holdings is treated as a surrogate foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874 of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, dividends paid by Holdings would not qualify for \"qualified dividend income” treatment, and U.S. Affiliates of Holdings after the completion of the Business Combination, including MGO, could be subject to increased taxation under the inversion gain rules and Section 59A of the Code.\n\n11  \n---  \n  \nHoldings believes it should not be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874 of the Code or as a surrogate foreign corporation. However, whether the requirements for such treatment have been satisfied must be finally determined after the completion of the Business Combination, by which time there could be adverse changes to the relevant facts and circumstances. Furthermore, the interpretation of Treasury regulations relating to the required ownership of Holdings is subject to uncertainty and there is limited guidance regarding their application. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a contrary position to those described above or that a court will not agree with a contrary position of the IRS in the event of litigation. You are urged to consult your tax advisor to determine the tax consequences if the classification of Holdings as a non-U.S. corporation is not respected or if Holdings is treated as a surrogate foreign corporation.\n\n**_If Holdings is a passive foreign investment company for United States federal income tax purposes for any taxable year, U.S. holders of Holdings Shares could be subject to adverse United States federal income tax consequences_** _._\n\nIf Holdings is or becomes a \"passive foreign investment company,” or a PFIC, within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code for any taxable year during which a U.S. holder holds Holdings Shares, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences may apply to such U.S. holder. A non-U.S. corporation, such as Holdings, will be classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year in which, after applying certain look-through rules, either (i) 75% or more of its gross income for such year consists of certain types of \"passive” income or (ii) 50% or more of the value of its assets (determined on the basis of a quarterly average) during such year produce or are held for the production of passive income. Passive income generally includes dividends, interest, royalties, rents, annuities, net gains from the sale or exchange of property producing such income and net foreign currency gains. Heidmar does not believe that Holdings will be treated as a PFIC for its current taxable year and does not expect to become one in the near future. However, PFIC status depends on the composition of a company’s income and assets and the fair market value of its assets from time to time, as well as on the application of complex statutory and regulatory rules that are subject to potentially varying or changing interpretations.\n\nIf Holdings determines that it is a PFIC for any taxable year, Holdings will endeavor to provide, and will endeavor to cause its non-U.S. subsidiaries that are PFICs, to provide, U.S. holders with tax information necessary to enable a U.S. holder to make a qualified electing fund (QEF) election with respect to Holdings and its non-U.S. subsidiaries.\n\nIf Holdings is treated as a PFIC, a U.S. holder of Holdings Shares may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, such as taxation at the highest marginal ordinary income tax rates on capital gains and on certain actual or deemed distributions, interest charges on certain taxes treated as deferred, and additional reporting requirements. U.S. holders of Holdings Shares should consult with their tax advisors regarding the potential application of these rules.\n\n**_The Business Combination may not qualify as a non-taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**\n\nIf the Business Combination does not qualify as a non-taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of Holdings Shares in exchange for MGO Shares pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. Holder of MGO Shares that receives Holdings Shares pursuant to the Merger will generally recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the sum of the fair market value of the Holdings Shares received as consideration in the Merger and (ii) its adjusted tax basis in the MGO Shares surrendered in the exchange.\n\nIn certain circumstances, Section 304 of the Code may cause a holder of MGO Shares that also owns, actually or constructively, Heidmar Shares (and will actually or constructively own Holdings Shares issued in exchange for such Heidmar Shares pursuant to the Heidmar Share Acquisition) to be treated as receiving a dividend up to the fair market value of the Holdings Shares and cash received in the Merger, regardless of its gain or loss in the Merger.\n\n12  \n---  \n  \n**Risks Related to Holdings Becoming a Public Company**\n\n**_There can be no assurance that the Holdings Shares will be approved for listing on Nasdaq or any other national securities exchange, or that Holdings will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq or any other national securities exchange._**\n\nIn connection with the Closing, Holdings intends to list the Holdings Shares on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange under the symbol \"HMR”. If, after the Business Combination, Nasdaq delists Holdings’ shares from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards and Holdings is not able to list its shares on another national securities exchange, Holdings expects its shares could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, Holdings and its shareholders could face significant material adverse consequences including:\n\n● | a limited availability of market quotations for Holdings Shares;  \n---|---  \n● | reduced liquidity for Holdings Shares;  \n● | a determination that the Holdings Shares are \"penny stock,” which would require brokers trading the Holdings Shares to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for Holdings Shares;  \n● | a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for Holdings; and  \n● | a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.  \n  \n**_Holdings is an emerging growth company and will therefore be subject to reduced reporting requirements that may make the Holdings Shares less attractive to investors._**\n\nFollowing the consummation of the Business Combination, Holdings will be an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as Holdings continues to be an emerging growth company, it may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \"emerging growth companies,” including exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Further, an emerging growth company’s auditor is exempt from the requirement to communicate critical audit matters in the auditor’s report. Holdings will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (x) during which the fifth anniversary of the effective date of this proxy statement/prospectus occurs, (y) in which Holdings has total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion or (z) in which Holdings is deemed to be a large accelerated filer (which means the market value of Holdings Shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the last Business Day of the second fiscal quarter of that fiscal year), and (ii) the date on which Holdings has issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\n\nIn addition, under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. Holdings may elect to avail itself of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards in the future and, therefore, Holdings would not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\n\nHoldings cannot predict if investors will find Holdings Shares less attractive because Holdings may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find the Holdings Shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for the Holdings Shares and its market price may be more volatile.\n\n**_Holdings will be a \"controlled company” within the meaning of the Nasdaq rules and will be exempt from certain corporate governance requirements as a result._**\n\nImmediately following the completion of the Business Combination, Heidmar Shareholders who are not U.S. persons, will control a majority of the voting power of the outstanding Holdings Shares.\n\nAs a result, Holdings will be a \"controlled company” within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of Nasdaq. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a \"controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:\n\n● | the requirement that a majority of the board of directors of Holdings (the \"Holdings Board”) consist of \"independent directors” as defined under the rules of Nasdaq;  \n---|---  \n● | the requirement that the Holdings Board form a compensation committee composed of at least two independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s responsibilities; and  \n● | the requirement that nominees of the Holdings Board be selected by either (a) independent directors constituting a majority of the Holdings Board’s independent directors or (b) a nominations committee comprised solely of independent directors.  \n  \n13  \n---  \n  \nFollowing the Business Combination, Holdings intends to utilize some or all of these exemptions. As a result, you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq.\n\n**_Holdings will be a \"foreign private issuer” under U.S. securities laws, which exempts it from certain reporting and other obligations and could make the Holdings Shares less attractive to some investors._**\n\nFollowing the Business Combination, Holdings will be a \"foreign private issuer,” as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act”). This means that the information Holdings will be required to publicly disclose will be different from those required of domestic public companies, including the following.\n\n● | Holdings will not have to provide certain information as often or as quickly as domestic filers, including quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K.  \n---|---  \n● | Holdings’ directors, officers and Affiliates (its \"insiders”) will not be subject to the provisions of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act”) requiring disclosure of stock purchases and sales, which means investors will have less information in this regard than they do about MGO or other domestic public companies.  \n● | Holdings’ insiders also won’t be subject to the \"short swing” profit liability in Section 16 of the Exchange Act.  \n● | Holdings will not be subject to the provisions of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, and its proxy statements are not subject to review by the SEC, which means there may be less public information regarding Holdings and its governance than for MGO or other domestic companies.  \n● | Holdings will not be subject to the selective disclosure rules relating to material nonpublic information under Regulation FD.  \n  \nHoldings will be required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the end of each fiscal year. In addition, Holdings intends to publish its results on a quarterly basis through press releases, distributed pursuant to the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. Press releases relating to financial results and material events will also be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K. However, the information Holdings is required to file with or furnish to the SEC will be less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be filed with the SEC by U.S. domestic issuers. As a result, you may not be afforded the same protections or information, which would be made available to you, were you investing in a U.S. domestic issuer. Further, these factors could the Holdings Shares less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm its share price.\n\n**_Holdings is permitted to follow certain \"home country” governance practices in the Marshall Islands rather than the corporate governance requirements of the Nasdaq._**\n\nAs a foreign private issuer, Holdings will have the option to follow certain home country corporate governance practices rather than those of the Nasdaq, provided that Holdings discloses the requirements it is not following and describe the home country practices it is following. Holdings intends to rely on this \"foreign private issuer exemption” with respect to Nasdaq rules requiring shareholder approval. Holdings may in the future elect to follow home country practices with regard to other matters. As a result, Holdings’ shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.\n\n**_Holdings may lose its foreign private issuer status in the future, which could result in significant additional costs and expenses._**\n\nAt the Closing of the Business Combination, Holdings will be a foreign private issuer, which means it will not be required to comply with all of the periodic disclosure and current reporting requirements of the Exchange Act that are applicable to domestic companies. A company’s foreign private issuer status is determined annually on the last Business Day of its most second fiscal quarter, and, accordingly, the next determination will be made with respect to Holdings on June 30, 2025. In the future, Holdings would lose its foreign private issuer status if (a) more than 50% of its outstanding voting securities are owned by U.S. residents and (b) one of the following three things are true: (1) a majority of its directors or executive officers are U.S. citizens or residents, (2) it administers its business principally from the United States or (3) a majority of its assets are located in the United States. If Holdings loses its foreign private issuer status, it would be required to file with the SEC periodic reports and registration statements on U.S. domestic issuer forms, which are more detailed and extensive than the forms available to a foreign private issuer. Holdings would also have to mandatorily comply with U.S. federal proxy requirements, and Holdings’ officers, directors and principal shareholders would become subject to the short-swing profit disclosure and recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. In addition, Holdings would lose its ability to rely upon exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements under the listing rules of the Nasdaq. As a U.S. listed public company that is not a foreign private issuer, Holdings would incur significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses that it would not incur as a foreign private issuer.\n\n14  \n---  \n  \n**_The requirements of being a public company may strain Holdings’ resources, divert Holdings management’s attention and affect Holdings’ ability to attract and retain qualified board members._**\n\nHoldings will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, Nasdaq listing requirements and other applicable securities rules and regulations. As such, Holdings will incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses following the completion of the Business Combination. These expenses may increase even more once Holdings no longer qualifies as an \"emerging growth company.” The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that Holdings file annual and current reports with respect to its business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that Holdings maintains effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Holdings may need to hire more employees post-Business Combination or engage outside consultants to comply with these requirements, which will increase its post-Business Combination costs and expenses.\n\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. Holdings expects these laws and regulations to increase its legal and financial compliance costs after the Business Combination and to render some activities more time-consuming and costly, although Holdings is currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty.\n\nMany members of Holdings’ management team will have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Holdings’ management team may not successfully or efficiently manage the transition to being a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and regulations and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. The need to establish the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert the management’s attention from implementing its growth strategy, which could prevent Holdings from improving its business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, Holdings expects these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for Holdings to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and consequently Holdings may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. These additional obligations could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. These factors could also make it more difficult for Holdings to attract and retain qualified members of its board of directors, particularly to serve on Holdings’ finance and audit committee and nomination and compensation committee, and to attract and retain qualified executive officers.\n\nAs a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, Holdings’ business and financial condition will become more visible, which Holdings believes may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, Holdings’ business and operating results could be adversely affected, and, even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in Holdings’ favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could cause an adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and reputation.\n\n**_Holdings’ failure to timely and effectively implement controls and procedures required by Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that will be applicable to it after the Closing could have a material adverse effect on its business._**\n\nHeidmar is currently not subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. However, following the Closing, Holdings will be required to provide management’s attestation on internal controls. The standards required for a public company under Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are significantly more stringent than those required of Heidmar as a privately-held company. Management may not be able to effectively and timely implement controls and procedures that adequately respond to the increased regulatory compliance and reporting requirements that will be applicable after the Business Combination. If Holdings is not able to implement the additional requirements of Section 404(a) in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, it may not be able to assess whether its internal controls over financial reporting are effective, which may subject it to adverse regulatory consequences and could harm investor confidence and the market price of its securities.\n\n15  \n---  \n  \n**Risks Related to the Holdings Shares**\n\n**_Upon completion of the Business Combination, MGO Stockholders will become shareholders of Holdings, and the market price for the Holdings Shares may be affected by factors different from those that historically have affected MGO._**\n\nUpon completion of the Business Combination, MGO Stockholders will become shareholders of Holdings. Holdings’ business differs from that of MGO, and, accordingly, the results of operations of Holdings will be affected by some factors that are different from those currently affecting the results of operations of MGO. Holdings is a holding company incorporated in the Marshall Islands, and, after the consummation of the Business Combination, will have as its direct subsidiaries MGO and Heidmar. Heidmar is engaged in tanker pooling, commercial and asset management, and time charters, businesses quite distinct from those that MGO currently operates. Holdings’ business and results of operations will, therefore, be affected by operating, industry and regional risks to which MGO is not currently exposed.\n\n**_Future sales of Holdings Shares, including resales by the Heidmar Shareholders and other significant shareholders, may cause the market price of the Holdings Shares to drop significantly, even if Holdings’ business is doing well._**\n\nUnder the Business Combination Agreement, after the Closing, it is anticipated that existing Heidmar Shareholders will hold 94.34% of Holdings (including amounts to be distributed to MGO’s financial advisor) and the former MGO stockholders will hold 5.66% of Holdings, without taking into account the issuance of any Earnout Shares. All of these Holdings Shares will be issued to these holders pursuant to the registration statement that Holdings will file in connection with the Business Combination, and therefore will be freely tradable by their holders, subject in certain cases to the restrictions applicable to \"control securities” under U.S. securities laws. The Holdings Shares held by the Heidmar Shareholders and the MGO Principals will also be subject to lock-up/leak-out agreements between these holders and Holdings, pursuant to which the Heidmar Shareholders, and the MGO Principals will be restricted from transferring their shares for four months after the Closing and have limits on the number of shares they may sell during the fifth and sixth month after the Closing, subject to certain customary exceptions.\n\nThe sale by these holders of substantial quantities of Holdings Shares, or the market’s perception that such a sale is pending, could cause a significant decrease in the price of the Holdings Shares. This could occur as the expiration of the lock-up or leak-out periods approach, upon an announcement of the waiver of the lock-up/leak-out restrictions applicable to some or all of the shares or for other reasons. Any of these could have the effect of increasing the volatility in, or putting significant downward pressure on, the price of Holdings Shares.\n\nIn addition, Holdings could seek to issue new Holdings Shares for sale or as consideration for an acquisition, which could also cause the market price of Holdings Shares to decline or impair Holdings’ ability to raise capital through a future sale of, or pay for acquisitions using, Holdings’ equity securities.\n\n**_The future exercise of registration rights may adversely affect the market price of Holdings’ securities._**\n\nIn connection with the Transactions Holdings will enter into a Registration Rights Agreement with the Heidmar Shareholders (each, a \"Holder”). Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, Holdings has agreed to file a Registration Statement with the SEC for the resale by the Holders from time-to-time of their Holdings Shares. The Holders will also be entitled to demand that Holdings engage in an underwritten offering of their Holdings Shares and will also have certain \"piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed for other offerings by Holdings. The presence of these additional Holdings Shares trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of Holdings’ securities.\n\n**_The market price of Holdings Shares may be volatile, and you may lose all or part of your investment._**\n\nImmediately following completion of the Business Combination and the other transactions, Holdings will have outstanding shares that will be freely tradable without restriction. Sales by Holdings or Holdings’ shareholders of a substantial number of Holdings Shares, the issuance of Holdings Shares as consideration for acquisitions, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of the Holdings Shares to decline or could impair Holdings’ ability to raise capital through a future sale of, or pay for acquisitions using, Holdings’ equity securities.\n\nThe market price of the Holdings Shares may be volatile, because of actual and perceived changes specific events regarding Holdings’ business, financial performance and prospects, general economic events and conditions, and general volatility in the stock market. The factors that could cause fluctuations in Holdings’ share price may include, among other factors (including those discussed in this \"Risk Factors” section) the following:\n\n● | actual or anticipated fluctuations in Holdings’ results of operations;  \n---|---  \n● | variance in Holdings’ financial performance from the expectations of market analysts or others;  \n  \n16  \n---  \n  \n● | announcements by Holdings or Holdings’ competitors of significant business developments, changes in significant customers, acquisitions or expansion plans;  \n---|---  \n● | Holdings’ involvement in litigation;  \n● | Holdings’ sale of Holdings Shares or other securities in the future;  \n● | market conditions in Holdings’ industry;  \n● | changes in key personnel;  \n● | the trading volume of Holdings’ Common Shares;  \n● | the sale of a substantial number of Holdings Shares by Holdings or its shareholders, or the perception that such a sale may occur;  \n● | changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of Holdings’ markets; and  \n● | general economic and market conditions.  \n  \nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of the Holdings Shares, regardless of Holdings’ operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company. If Holdings was involved in any similar litigation, Holdings could incur substantial costs and Holdings’ management’s attention and resources could be diverted.\n\n**_Volatility in Holdings’ share price could subject Holdings to securities class action litigation._**\n\nThe market price of the Holdings Shares may be volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their shares have been subject to securities class action litigation. Holdings may be the target of this type of litigation and investigations. Securities litigation against Holdings could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm Holdings’ business.\n\n**_An active trading market for the Holdings Shares may not be sustained to provide adequate liquidity._**\n\nAn active trading market may not be sustained for Holdings Shares. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. An inactive market may also impair Holdings’ ability to raise capital by selling Holdings Shares and may impair Holdings’ ability to acquire other companies by using Holdings’ shares as consideration.\n\n**_Holdings is a holding company that depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute funds to it in order to satisfy its financial and other obligations._**\n\nHoldings is a holding company that has no significant assets other than cash and the equity of its subsidiaries. Holdings’ ability to pay dividends and fulfill respective financial obligations depends on the performance of its subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to Holdings. The ability of Holdings’ subsidiaries to make these distributions may become subject to restrictions contained in those subsidiaries’ financing agreements and could be affected by a claim or other action by a third party, including a creditor, or by Marshall Islands law which regulates the payment of dividends by companies. If Holdings is unable to obtain sufficient funds from its subsidiaries to satisfy future liquidity requirements and/or to finance future operations or if for other reasons its subsidiaries are unable to upstream funds to it, Holdings may not be able to pay dividends.\n\n**_Holdings’ ability to pay dividends is subject to limitations and risks that could cause those dividends to be lower than expected or to not be paid at all._**\n\nHoldings has never declared or paid any dividends on the Holdings Shares. Heidmar, which will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings immediately following the Closing, paid an aggregate of $25 million in dividends in 2023 and did not pay any dividends in 2022. Heidmar has not yet paid any dividends in 2024, however the Business Combination Agreement requires Heidmar to have at least $10 million of cash and accounts receivable at Closing, and Heidmar expects to pay a dividend to the Heidmar Shareholders prior to Closing equal to its cash and accounts receivable in excess of that amount.\n\nAny payment of any dividends by Holdings will be subject to certain limitations and qualifications including that:\n\n● | Holdings intends to pay any dividends from its operating surplus, less amounts it retains to fund its expansion, for debt repayment and for other corporate purposes, as determined by Holdings’ management and board of directors;  \n---|---  \n● | the declaration and payment of dividends will be subject at all times to the discretion of the Holdings Board;  \n  \n17  \n---  \n  \n● | the timing and amount of dividends will depend on Holdings’ earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and availability, fleet renewal and expansion, restrictions in its loan agreements, the provisions of Marshall Islands law affecting the payment of dividends and other factors; and  \n---|---  \n● | the requirements of Marshall Islands law, which generally prohibits the payment of dividends other than from surplus, while a company is insolvent, or if it would be rendered insolvent upon the payment of such dividends, or if there is no surplus, dividends may be declared or paid out of net income for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared, and for the preceding fiscal year.  \n  \nIn addition, Holdings’ ability to pay any dividends is subject to and can be diminished by the risks set forth in this \"_Risk Factors_ ” section, any of which could result in Holdings being unable to pay its expected dividends or any dividends at all. If Holdings fails to pay dividends at the expected rate, the value of Holdings Shares will decrease, and you could lose some or all of your investment.\n\n**_Investors may suffer adverse tax consequences in connection with the acquisition, ownership and disposal of the Holdings Shares._**\n\nThe tax consequences in connection with the acquisition, ownership and disposal of the Holdings Shares may differ from the tax consequences in connection with the acquisition, ownership and disposal of securities in another entity and may also differ depending on such an investor’s respective circumstances including, without limitation, where such an investor is a tax resident. Any such tax consequences could be materially adverse to such an investor and therefore, such an investor should seek its own tax advice in respect of the tax consequences in connection with the acquisition, ownership and disposal of the Holdings Shares.\n\n**_The number of issued Holdings Shares may fluctuate substantially, which could lead to adverse tax consequences for the holders thereof._**\n\nIt may be that the number of issued and outstanding Holdings Shares fluctuates substantially. This may have an impact on interests and certain thresholds that are relevant for investors’ tax purposes and positions, also dependent on their respective circumstances. The potential tax consequences in this regard could potentially be material, and therefore, investors should seek their own tax advice with respect to the tax consequences in connection with the acquisition, ownership and disposal of the Holdings Shares.\n\n**_If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about Holdings’ business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding Holdings Shares, the market price and trading volume of Holdings Shares could decline._**\n\nThe trading market for Holdings Shares will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about Holdings or Holdings’ business. Holdings does not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no or few securities or industry analysts commence coverage of Holdings, the trading price for Holdings Shares would be negatively impacted. In the event Holdings obtains securities or industry analyst coverage, if any of the analysts who cover Holdings issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding Holdings, Holdings’ business model, Holdings’ intellectual property or Holdings’ stock performance, or if Holdings’ results of operations fail to meet the expectations of analysts, Holdings’ stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of Holdings or fail to publish reports on Holdings regularly, Holdings could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause Holdings’ stock price or trading volume to decline.\n\n**_Investor confidence and the market price of Holdings’ shares may be adversely impacted if Holdings’ management is unable to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting._**\n\nHoldings will become a U.S. public company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC”), following the completion of the Business Combination. SEC rules require a public company, to include a report from management of its internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting in that company’s annual report on Form 10-K or Form 20-F that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. This requirement will first apply to Holdings’ annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2024. In addition, independent registered public accountants of a public company must report on the effectiveness of that company’s internal controls over financial reporting after that company loses emerging growth company status and has met accelerated filer status. Holdings’ management may not conclude that its internal controls over financial reporting are effective. Moreover, even if Holdings’ management does conclude that its internal controls over financial reporting are effective, if its independent registered public accountants are not satisfied with its internal control structure and procedures, the level at which its internal controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if the independent registered public accountants interpret the requirements, rules or regulations differently from Holdings’ management, they may not concur with its management’s assessment or may not issue a report that is unqualified. Any of these outcomes could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of Holdings’ financial statements, which could lead to a decline in the market price of its shares. Further, the total cost of Holdings’ initial compliance and the future ongoing costs of complying with U.S. public company requirements will be substantial.\n\n18  \n---  \n  \n**_Currently, there is no public market for the Holdings Shares. MGO Stockholders cannot be sure that an active trading market will develop for the Holdings Shares, the market price they will receive or that Holdings will successfully obtain authorization for listing on the Nasdaq._**\n\nAs part of the Business Combination, each issued and outstanding MGO Share will be converted into the right to receive one Holdings Common Share. Holdings is a newly formed entity, and prior to this transaction it has not issued any securities in the U.S. markets or elsewhere. Further, extensive information about Holdings, its businesses or its operations has not previously been publicly available. MGO and Holdings have agreed to cause the Holdings Shares to be issued in the Business Combination to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq prior to the effective time of the Business Combination. However, the listing of shares on the Nasdaq does not ensure that a market for the Holdings Shares will develop or the price at which the shares will trade. No assurance can be provided as to the demand for or trading price of the Holdings Shares following the Closing and the Holdings Shares may trade at a price less than the current market price of the MGO Shares.\n\nEven if Holdings is successful in developing a public market, there may not be enough liquidity to enable shareholders to sell their common shares. If a public market for the Holdings Shares does not develop, investors may not be able to re-sell their common shares, rendering their shares illiquid and possibly resulting in a complete loss of their investment. Holdings cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in Holdings will lead to the development of an active, liquid trading market. The trading price of and demand for the Holdings Shares following completion of the Business Combination and the development and continued existence of a market and favorable price for the Holdings Shares will depend on a number of conditions, including the development of a market following, including by analysts and other investment professionals, the businesses, operations, results and prospects of Holdings, general market and economic conditions, governmental actions, regulatory considerations, legal proceedings and developments or other factors. These and other factors may impair the development of a liquid market and the ability of investors to sell shares at an attractive price. These factors also could cause the market price and demand for the Holdings Shares to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares and may otherwise affect negatively the price and liquidity of the Holdings Shares. Many of these factors and conditions are beyond the control of Holdings or Holdings shareholders.\n\n**_Recent market volatility could impact the share price and trading volume of Holdings’ securities._**\n\nThe trading market for Holdings’ securities could be impacted by recent market volatility. Recent stock run-ups, divergences in valuation ratios relative to those seen during traditional markets, high short interest or short squeezes, and strong and atypical retail investor interest in the markets may impact the demand for Holdings Shares.\n\nA possible \"short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand of Holdings Shares that largely exceeds supply may lead to price volatility in Holdings Shares. Investors may purchase Holdings Shares to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of the Holdings Shares, which may involve both long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of Holdings Shares available for purchase, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase Holdings Shares for delivery to lenders. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of the Holdings Shares. This is often referred to as a \"short squeeze.” A short squeeze could lead to volatile price movements in the Holdings Shares that are not directly correlated to the operating performance of Holdings.\n\n**_If the Holdings Shares are not eligible for deposit and clearing within the facilities of the Depository Trust Company, then Transactions in the Holdings Shares may be disrupted._**\n\nThe facilities of the Depository Trust Company (\"DTC”) are a widely used mechanism that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in the DTC system, which include many large banks and brokerage firms. Holdings expects that Holdings Shares will be eligible for deposit and clearing within the DTC system. Holdings expects to enter into arrangements with DTC whereby it will agree to indemnify DTC for stamp duty that may be assessed upon it as a result of its service as a depository and clearing agency for the Holdings Shares. Holdings expects these actions, among others, will result in DTC agreeing to accept the Holdings Shares for deposit and clearing within its facilities.\n\nDTC is not obligated to accept Holdings Shares for deposit and clearing within its facilities in connection with the listing and, even if DTC does initially accept Holdings Shares, it will generally have discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agency for Holdings Shares.\n\n19  \n---  \n  \nIf DTC determines at any time after the completion of the Transactions and the listing that the Holdings Shares were not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities, then Holdings believes the Holdings Shares would not be eligible for continued listing on a U.S. securities exchange and trading in the shares would be disrupted. While Holdings would pursue alternative arrangements to preserve its listing and maintain trading, any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Holdings Shares.\n\n**Risks Related to MGO’s Business and Industry**\n\n**_We have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful._**\n\nThe Company has a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of its business and prospects. The Company is subject to all the risks inherent in a small company seeking to develop, market and distribute new services, particularly companies in evolving markets such as the Internet, digital technology and payment systems. The likelihood of the Company’s success must be considered, in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the development, introduction, marketing and distribution of new products and services in a competitive environment.\n\nSuch risks for the Company include, but are not limited to, dependence on the success and acceptance of the Company’s products, the ability to attract and retain a suitable client base and the management of growth. To address these risks, the Company must, among other things, generate increased demand; attract a sufficient customer base; respond to competitive developments; successfully introduce new products; attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel and upgrade and enhance the Company’s technologies to accommodate expanded service offerings. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of the Company’s business and its limited operating history, the Company believes that period-to-period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\n\nThe Company is therefore subject to many of the risks common to early-stage enterprises, including under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financial and other resources and lack of revenues.\n\n**_We have a history of operating losses and may continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future._**\n\nWe recorded a net loss attributable to MGO stockholders of $7,143,404 as of December 31, 2023 and a net loss attributable to MGO stockholders of $2,582,946 as of December 31, 2022. We also recorded a net loss attributable to MGO stockholders of $3,944,092 as of September 30, 2024. We cannot anticipate when, if ever, our operations will become profitable. We expect to incur significant net losses as we develop our business and pursue our business strategy. We intend to invest significantly in our business before we expect cash flow from operations to be adequate to cover our operating expenses. If we are unable to execute our business strategy and grow our business, for any reason, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\n\nThe Company is attempting to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Company’s cash position may not be sufficient to support its operations. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds by the sale of its equity, there can be no assurances to that effect.\n\n**_Our business depends on our ability to maintain a strong community around the Stand Flagpole brand with engaged customers and influencers. We may not be able to maintain and enhance our existing brand communities if we receive customer complaints, negative publicity or otherwise fail to live up to consumers’ expectations, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations._**\n\nWe believe that maintaining our brand images, particularly with our core target customers, is important to maintaining and expanding our customer base and sales. Maintaining and enhancing our brand images may require us to make additional investments in areas such as merchandising, marketing, online operations, online displays and other promotions, and employee training. These investments may be substantial and may not ultimately be successful. If we are unable to maintain or enhance our brand image, brand awareness and reputation, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\n\n20  \n---  \n  \nOver the course of 2023, our ability to successfully market our curated flagpole and flagpole accessories, offered through _www.StandFlagpoles.com,_ has been dependent on identifying and accessing our target audience of customers, namely active military and military veterans, as well as American homeowners who desire to display a symbol of their patriotism and political affiliations.\n\nA significant portion of our customers’ experience with our brands depends on third parties outside of our control, including suppliers and logistics providers, such as UPS, DHL and the U.S. Postal Service. If these third parties do not meet our or our customers’ expectations or if they increase their rates, our business may suffer irreparable damage, or our costs may increase. In addition, establishing, maintaining and enhancing relationships with other third-party brands may require us to make substantial investments, and these investments may not be successful. Also, if we fail to promote and maintain our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. We anticipate that, as the markets for our branded product lines become increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brands may become increasingly difficult and expensive.\n\nCustomer complaints or negative publicity about our websites or mobile apps, products, merchandise quality, product delivery times, customer data handling, security practices or customer support, especially on social media, blogs and in reviews, could rapidly and severely diminish consumer use of our websites or mobile apps and customer and supplier confidence in us, and result in harm to our brand. We believe that much of the growth in our customer bases to date has originated from word-of-mouth, including social media and our influencer-driven marketing strategy. If we are not able to develop and maintain positive relationships with our network of influencers or our online customer community, our ability to promote and maintain or enhance awareness of the _Stand Flagpoles_ brand and leverage social media platforms to drive visits to _www.standflagpoles.com_ may be adversely affected.\n\n**_We may be unable to maintain a high level of engagement with our customers and increase their spending with us, which could harm our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations._**\n\nA portion of our net revenue comes from repeat purchases by existing customers, especially those existing customers who are highly engaged and purchase a significant amount of merchandise from us. If existing customers no longer find our merchandise appealing, they may make fewer purchases and may stop shopping with us. Even if our existing customers find our merchandise appealing, if customer buying preferences change, they may decide to purchase less merchandise over time. Additionally, if customers who purchase a significant amount of merchandise from us were to make fewer purchases or stop shopping with us, then our sales may decline. A decrease in the number of our customers or a decrease in their spending on the merchandise we offer could negatively impact our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. Further, we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to increase sales to our existing customers over time and, if we are unable to do so, our business may suffer.\n\n**_Our success depends on our ability to anticipate, identify, measure and respond quickly to new and rapidly changing market trends, customer preferences and demands and other factors._**\n\nOur core market for flagpoles and related ancillary products are subject to new and rapidly changing market trends, constantly evolving consumer preferences and demands, and preserving brand loyalty. Accordingly, our success is dependent on our ability to anticipate, identify, measure and respond to the latest trends and customer demands, and to translate such trends and demands into appropriate, desirable product offerings in a timely manner. A select team of our employees is primarily responsible for performing this analysis and making initial product decisions, and they rely on feedback on trends from a variety of sources, which may not accurately predict evolving trends. Our failure to anticipate, identify or react swiftly and appropriately to new and changing trends or desired customer preferences, or to accurately anticipate and forecast demand for certain product offerings, is likely to lead to lower demand for our merchandise, which could cause, among other things, sales declines, excess inventories, a greater number of markdowns and lower margins. Further, if we are not able to anticipate, identify and respond to changing trends and customer preferences, we may lose customers and market share to our competitors who may be able to better anticipate, identify and respond to such trends and preferences. In addition, because our success depends on our brand images, our business could be materially adversely affected if new product offerings are not accepted by our customers. We cannot assure investors that our new product offerings will be met with the same level of acceptance as our past product offerings or that we will be able to adequately respond to market trends or the preferences of our customers in a timely manner or at all. If we do not accurately anticipate, identify, forecast or analyze trends and sales levels, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\n\n21  \n---  \n  \n**_Our business depends on effective marketing and high customer traffic._**\n\nWe have many initiatives in our marketing programs particularly with regard to our websites, mobile applications and our social media presence. If our competitors increase their spending on marketing, if our marketing expenses increase, if our marketing becomes less effective than that of our competitors, or if we do not adequately leverage technology and data analytics capabilities needed to generate concise competitive insight, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Among other factors, (1) a failure to sufficiently innovate or maintain effective marketing strategies and (2) U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that make it more difficult or costly to digitally market, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\"CCPA”), may adversely impact our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales.\n\n**_We rely on third parties to drive traffic to our platform, and these providers may change their algorithms or pricing in ways that could negatively affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations._**\n\nOur success depends on our ability to attract customers cost effectively. With respect to our marketing channels, we rely heavily on relationships with providers of online services, search engines, social media, directories and other websites and e-commerce businesses to provide content, advertising banners and other links that direct customers to our websites. We rely on these relationships to provide significant traffic to our website. In particular, we rely on digital platforms, such as Instagram, Google and Facebook, as important marketing channels. Digital channels change their algorithms periodically, and our rankings in organic searches and visibility in social media feeds may be adversely affected by those changes, as has occurred from time to time, requiring us to increase our spending on paid marketing to offset the loss in traffic. Search engine companies may also determine that we are not in compliance with their guidelines and consequently penalize us in their algorithms as a result. Even with an increase in marketing spend to offset any loss in search engine optimization traffic as a result of algorithm changes, the recovery period in organic traffic may span multiple quarters or years. If digital platforms change or penalize us with their algorithms, terms of service, display and featuring of search results, or if competition increases for advertisements, we may be unable to cost-effectively attract customers.\n\nOur relationships with digital platforms are not covered by long-term contractual agreements and do not require any specific performance commitments. In addition, many of the platforms and agencies with whom we have advertising arrangements provide advertising services to other companies, including retailers with whom we compete. As competition for online advertising has increased, the cost for some of these services has also increased. A significant increase in the cost of the marketing providers upon which we rely could adversely impact our ability to attract customers cost effectively and harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n**_Use of social media, influencers, affiliate marketing, email, text messages and direct mail may adversely impact our brand and reputation or subject us to fines or other penalties._**\n\nWe use social media, including Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Weibo, as well as affiliate marketing, email, SMS, and direct mail as part of our multi-channel approach to marketing, and we encourage our customers to use social media while shopping. In the future, we may also elect to establish relationships with social media influencers, who may serve as our brand ambassadors, and engage in sponsorship initiatives. Laws and regulations governing the use of these platforms and other digital marketing channels are rapidly evolving. It may become more difficult for us or our partners to comply with such laws, and future data privacy laws and regulations or industry standards may restrict or limit our ability to use some or all of the marketing strategies on which we currently rely. The failure by us, our employees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms could adversely impact our reputation or subject us to fines or other penalties. In addition, our employees or third parties acting at our direction may knowingly or inadvertently make use of social media in ways that could lead to the loss or infringement of intellectual property, as well as the public disclosure of proprietary, confidential or sensitive personal information of our business, employees, customers or others. Any such inappropriate use of social media tools could also cause business interruptions and reputational damage.\n\nCustomers value readily available information concerning retailers and their goods and services and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy. Information concerning us, whether accurate or not, may be posted on social media platforms at any time and may have a disproportionately adverse impact on our brand, reputation or business. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, an increase in the use of social media for product promotion and marketing may cause an increase in the burden on us to monitor compliance of such materials and increase the risk that such materials could contain problematic product or marketing claims in violation of applicable regulations. For example, in some cases, the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC”) has sought enforcement action where an endorsement has failed to clearly and conspicuously disclose a financial relationship between an influencer and an advertiser.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \nNegative commentary regarding us, our products or potential influencers and other third parties who are affiliated with us may also be posted on social media platforms and may be adverse to our reputation or business. Influencers with whom we may establish relationships could engage in behavior or use their platforms to communicate directly with our customers in a manner that reflects poorly on our brand and may be attributed to us or otherwise adversely affect us. It is not possible to prevent such behavior, and the precautions we take to detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Our target customers often value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy. The harm may be immediate, without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.\n\n**_We have not historically used traditional advertising channels, and if we become unable to continue to connect with our target customer bases, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**\n\nWe utilize organic content, email, SMS, direct mail, paid search and social media marketing to capture the interest of our customers and drive them to our platform. We historically have not used traditional advertising channels, such as newspapers, magazines and television, which are used by some of our competitors. In the future, we expect to increase our use of social media, such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Weibo for marketing purposes. If our marketing efforts are not successful, there may be no immediately available or cost-effective alternative marketing channel for us to use to build or maintain brand awareness. As we execute our growth strategy, our ability to successfully integrate into our target customers’ communities or to expand into new markets will be dependent on our ability to connect with our target customers through our established marketing channels. Failure to successfully connect with our target customers in new and existing markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n**_We may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy._**\n\nOur future growth, profitability and cash flows depend upon our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, which, in turn, is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\n● | grow awareness of our brands and attract new customers;  \n---|---  \n● | enhance and retain our existing customer relationships;  \n● | pursue category expansions; and  \n● | pursue deeper international expansion.  \n  \nWe cannot ensure that we can successfully achieve any or all of the above initiatives in the manner or time period that we expect. Further, achieving these objectives will require investments which may result in short-term costs without generating any net revenue and, therefore, may be dilutive to our earnings. We cannot provide any assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits we expect our strategy will achieve. The failure to realize those benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n**_Our growth plan contemplates expansion into new markets, and our efforts to expand may ultimately be unsuccessful._**\n\nOur growth plan includes introducing our brands globally, including in countries and regions where we have no or limited operating experience. Expanding into new countries and regions involves significant risk, particularly if we have no experience in marketing, selling and engaging with customers in the market. For example, there is no guarantee that the success of a brand in the United Kingdom will translate to the success of that brand in other countries, such as the United States. Our efforts to expand into new countries and regions could fail for many reasons, including our failure to accurately or timely identify apparel trends in new markets, different consumer demand dynamics and lack of acceptance of new offerings by existing or new users, our failure to promote the new markets effectively, or negative publicity about us or our new markets. In addition, these initiatives may not drive increases in revenue, may require substantial investment and planning, and may bring us more directly into competition with companies that are better established, operate more effectively or have greater resources than we do. There is additional complexity associated with local laws, tariffs and shipping logistics in new countries where our brands do not have an established presence. Expanding into new markets will require additional investment of time and resources of our management and personnel. If we are unable to cost-effectively expand into new countries and regions, then our growth prospects and competitive position may be harmed and our business, results of operations and financial condition may suffer.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \n**_We face risks from our international business._**\n\nOur current growth strategy includes plans to expand our digital marketing and grow our e-commerce and retail presence internationally over the next several years. As we seek to expand internationally, we face competition from more established retail competitors. Consumer demand and behavior, as well as cultural differences, tastes and purchasing trends, may differ, and as a result, sales of our merchandise may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with our expectations. Our ability to conduct business internationally may be adversely impacted by political, economic and public health events (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), as well as the global economy. Any challenges that we encounter as we expand internationally may divert financial, operational and managerial resources from our existing operations, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, we are increasingly exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our revenue, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\n\n**_We rely on consumer discretionary spending and may be adversely affected by economic downturns and other macroeconomic conditions or trends._**\n\nOur business and results of operations are subject to global economic conditions and their impact on consumer discretionary spending. Customer purchases of discretionary retail items and specialty retail products, which include apparel, accessories and homewares, may be adversely affected by economic conditions such as employment levels, salary and wage levels, the availability of customer credit, inflation, high interest rates, high tax rates, high fuel prices and customer confidence with respect to current and future economic conditions. Customer purchases may decline during recessionary periods or at other times when unemployment is higher, fuel prices are higher or disposable income is lower. These risks may be exacerbated for retailers like us that focus significantly on selling discretionary fashion merchandise to customers who seek value. Customer willingness to make discretionary purchases may decline, may stall or may be slow to increase due to national and regional economic conditions.\n\nOur sales may be particularly susceptible to economic and other conditions in certain regions or states. Considerable uncertainty and volatility remain in the national and global economy, and any further or future slowdowns or disruptions in the economy could adversely affect online shopping traffic and customer discretionary spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to maintain our recent rate of growth in net revenue if there is a decline in customer spending.\n\n**_We have been adversely affected by the effects of inflation and a potential recession._**\n\nInflation has adversely affected our liquidity, business, financial condition, and results of operations by increasing our overall cost structure and such affects will be further exacerbated if we are unable to achieve commensurate increases in the prices we charge our customers. The existence of inflation in the economy has resulted in, and may continue to result in, higher interest rates and capital costs, shipping costs, supply shortages, increased costs of labor, weakening exchange rates, and other similar effects. As a result of inflation, we have experienced and may continue to experience, cost increases. In addition, poor economic and market conditions, including a potential recession, may negatively impact market sentiment, decreasing the demand for sportswear and outerwear, which would adversely affect our operating income and results of operations. If we are unable to take effective measures in a timely manner to mitigate the impact of inflation, as well as a potential recession, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n**_Merchandise returns could harm our business._**\n\nWe allow our customers to return merchandise, subject to our return policy. If merchandise return economics become more costly, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. Further, we may modify our policies relating to returns from time to time, which may result in customer dissatisfaction or an increase in the number of merchandise returns. Supplier non-compliance can also result in increased returns. From time to time our products are damaged in transit, which can increase return rates and harm our brand. Competitive pressures could cause us to alter our return policies or our shipping policies, which could result in an increase in damaged products and an increase in merchandise returns.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \n**_If new trade restrictions are imposed or existing trade restrictions become more burdensome, our ability to source imported merchandise efficiently and cost effectively could be materially adversely affected._**\n\nWe purchase a portion of our inventory from foreign manufacturers, including those based in China, which is either directly imported by us from foreign suppliers or imported by domestic importers. Suppliers, to the extent they obtain merchandise from outside of the United States, are subject to trade restrictions, including tariffs, safeguards, or quotas, changes to which could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us. Under the World Trade Organization Agreement, effective January 1, 2005, the United States and other World Trade Organization member countries removed quotas on goods from World Trade Organization members, which in certain instances we believe affords our suppliers greater flexibility in importing textile and apparel products from World Trade Organization countries from which they source our merchandise. However, as the removal of quotas resulted in an import surge from China, the United States imposed safeguard quotas on a number of categories of goods and apparel from China and may impose additional quotas in the future. These and other trade restrictions could have a significant impact on our suppliers’ sourcing patterns in the future. The extent of this impact, if any, and the possible effect on our purchasing patterns and costs, cannot be determined at this time. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our suppliers’ merchandise is currently manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States or foreign governments, nor can we predict the likelihood, type or effect of any restrictions. Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards and customs restrictions against items we offer, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise to our suppliers; and we would expect the costs to be passed along in increased prices to us, which we may be unable to pass on to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n**_Our direct-to-consumer business model is subject to risks that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations._**\n\nWe sell merchandise direct-to-consumer through our online sites and mobile app. Our direct-to-consumer business model is subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results. Risks include, but are not limited to, (i) resellers purchasing private label and exclusive merchandise and reselling it outside of authorized distribution channels; (ii) failure of the systems that operate our ecommerce websites and their related support systems, including computer viruses; (iii) theft of customer information, privacy concerns, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions; (iv) credit card fraud; and (v) risks related to our supply chain and fulfillment operations. Risks specific to operating an ecommerce business also include (i) the ability to optimize the online experience and direct e-commerce channels to consumer needs, (ii) liability for copyright and trademark infringement, (iii) changing patterns of consumer behavior and (iv) competition from other ecommerce and brick-and-mortar retailers. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect our sales, as well as damage our reputation and brands.\n\n**_Our brands depend on the promotion of diversity and equality from an ethically and sustainably-sourced supply chain. If we are unable to do so, damage to our brands and reputation could result or failure to expand our brands could harm our business and results of operations._**\n\nOur customers and employees are increasingly focused on environmental, social and sustainability practices. We will depend significantly on building and maintaining our brands and reputation for promoting diversity and equality from an ethically- and sustainably sourced supply chain to attract customers and employees and grow our business. If we are unable to, for instance, prioritize transparency among our employees, appropriately enforce fair labor practices, obtain our materials from ethical and sustainable suppliers or reduce waste, our brands and reputation could be significantly impaired, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Customer values could shift faster than we are able to adjust our merchandise proposition.\n\n**_We could be required to collect additional sales taxes or be subject to other tax liabilities that may increase the costs our consumers would have to pay for our offering and adversely affect our operating results._**\n\nIn general, we have not historically collected state or local sales, use or other similar taxes in any jurisdictions in which we do not have a tax nexus, in reliance on court decisions or applicable exemptions that restrict or preclude the imposition of obligations to collect such taxes with respect to online sales of our products. In addition, we have not historically collected state or local sales, use or other similar taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we do have a physical presence, in reliance on applicable exemptions. On June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court decided, in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., that state and local jurisdictions may, at least in certain circumstances, enforce a sales and use tax collection obligation on remote vendors that have no physical presence in such jurisdiction. A number of states have already begun, or have positioned themselves to begin, requiring sales and use tax collection by remote vendors and/or by online marketplaces. The details and effective dates of these collection requirements vary from state to state. While we now collect, remit and report sales tax in all states that impose a sales tax, it is still possible that one or more jurisdictions may assert that we have liability for previous periods for which we did not collect sales, use or other similar taxes; and if such an assertion or assertions were successful, it could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales taxes and penalties and interest, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n25  \n---  \n  \n**_We do not have our own warehouse or distribution facilities but rely on a sole third-party logistics providers responsible for warehousing and fulfilling our orders. If our third-party providers experience disruptions to the operation of its distribution centers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**\n\nWhile we expanded our 3PL support services in 2023 through our partnership with a U.S.-based order fulfillment and inventory warehousing company with deep expertise in digital commerce, we have also relied on an international logistics company serving many renowned brands across global consumer goods industries for warehousing and fulfillment of our orders. This provider has distribution centers in Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom and the United States and has a capacity to process more than 300 million pieces of merchandise annually and distribute over 20 million packages through retail, wholesale and ecommerce sales channels. All of our merchandise is shipped from our suppliers to one of our providers’ distribution facilities and then packaged and shipped from these distribution facilities to our customers. The success of our business depends on our timely receipt of merchandise so we can continuously bring new, on-trend products online for sale. The success of our business also depends on customer orders being timely processed and delivered to meet promised delivery dates and satisfy our customers. The efficient flow of our merchandise requires that we have adequate capacity and uninterrupted service in our distribution facilities to support both our current level of operations and the anticipated increased levels that may follow from our growth plans. In order to accommodate future growth, we will either need to expand and upgrade distribution facilities with our existing provider or engage additional providers. Upgrading our existing arrangement or transferring our operations to another third-party provider with greater capacity will require us to incur additional costs, which could be significant, and may require us to obtain additional financing. Our failure to provide adequate order fulfillment, secure additional distribution capacity when necessary or retain a suitable third-party logistics provider could impede our growth plans. Further increasing this capacity could increase our costs, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, if our current providers encounter difficulties associated with their distribution facilities or if they were to shut down or be unable to operate for any reason, including because of fire, natural disaster, power outage or other event, we could face inventory shortages, resulting in \"out-of-stock” conditions on our website, and delays in shipments, resulting in significantly higher costs and longer lead times distributing our merchandise.\n\n**_Because we operate in an evolving industry, our past results may not be indicative of future performance, and our future performance may fluctuate materially, which will increase your investment risk._**\n\nWe operate in a rapidly evolving industry that may not develop as expected, if at all. Although we have experienced significant growth in net sales and the number of our active customers, it may be difficult to assess our future prospects. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we may encounter. These risks and difficulties include our ability to, among other things: acquire new customers who purchase products from us at the same rate and of the same type as existing customers; retain our existing customers and have them continue to purchase products from us at rates and methods consistent with their prior purchasing behavior; encourage customers to expand the categories of products they purchase from us; attract new brand partners so that we may offer a broader range of quality products to our customers at attractive prices; retain our existing brand partners and offer additional quality products to our customers at attractive prices; increase brand awareness; provide our customers with superior customer support; fulfill and deliver orders in a timely way and in accordance with customer expectations, which may change over time; respond to changes in consumer access to and use of the Internet and mobile devices; react to challenges from existing and new competitors; avoid interruptions or disruptions in our business; develop and maintain a scalable, high-performance technology and fulfillment infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably handle increased usage, as well as the deployment of new features and the sale of new products and services; respond to macroeconomic trends; and hire, integrate and retain qualified personnel.\n\n26  \n---  \n  \n**_If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed._**\n\nTo effectively manage our growth, we must continue to implement our operational plans and strategies, improve and expand our infrastructure of people and information systems and expand, train and manage our employee and contractor base. We have increased employee and contractor headcount since our inception to support the growth in our business, and we intend for this growth to continue for the foreseeable future. To support continued growth, we must effectively integrate, develop and motivate new employees, while maintaining our corporate culture. We face competition for qualified personnel. Additionally, we may not be able to hire new employees quickly enough to meet our needs. If we fail to effectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate our new hires, our efficiency and ability to meet our forecasts and our employee morale, productivity and retention could suffer, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nWe also acquire and retain customers through paid search/product listing ads, paid social, retargeting and personalized email and inbound marketing. If we are unable to cost-effectively drive traffic to our websites or mobile app, our ability to acquire new customers and our financial condition would suffer.\n\nAdditionally, the growth and expansion of our business and our product offerings in the future will place significant demands on our management. The growth of our business may require significant additional resources, which may not scale in a cost-effective manner or may negatively affect the quality of our customer experience. We are also required to manage multiple relationships with various vendors, customers and other third parties. Further growth of our operations, our vendor base, our fulfillment process, information technology systems or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations. If we are unable to manage the growth of our organization effectively, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\n\n**_If we are unable to obtain additional funding, we may not be able to grow our business operations._**\n\nWe will require additional funds to implement our business strategy. We may issue additional equity securities to raise needed capital. We may be unable to secure such funding when needed in adequate amounts or on acceptable terms, if at all. Any additional equity financing may involve substantial dilution to our then existing stockholders. The inability to raise additional capital will restrict our ability to develop and conduct business operations.\n\n**_We may be unable to accurately forecast net sales and appropriately plan our expenses in the future._**\n\nWe may base our current and future expense levels on our operating forecasts and estimates of future net sales and gross margins. Net sales and operating results are difficult to forecast, because they generally depend on the volume, timing and type of orders we receive, all of which are uncertain. Additionally, our business is affected by general economic and business conditions in the United States. A significant portion of our expenses is fixed, and as a result, we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in net sales. Any failure to accurately predict net sales or gross margins could cause our operating results in any given quarter, or a series of quarters, to be lower than expected, which could cause the price of our Common Stock to decline substantially.\n\n**_Competition from other brands may hinder the development of our business._**\n\nIncreased competitor consolidations, marketplace competition and competitive product and pricing pressures could impact our earnings, market share and volume growth. If, due to such pressure or other competitive threats, we are unable to sufficiently maintain or develop our sales, we may be unable to achieve our current revenue and financial targets. As a means of maintaining and expanding our sales revenues, we intend to introduce additional brands. We may not be successful in doing this, or it may take us longer than anticipated to achieve market acceptance of these new brands, if at all. Other companies may be more successful in this regard over the long term. Competition, particularly from companies with greater financial and marketing resources than ours, could have a material adverse effect on our existing markets, as well as on our ability to expand the market for our products.\n\n**_We compete in an industry that is brand-conscious, so brand name recognition and acceptance of our products are critical to our success._**\n\nOur business is substantially dependent upon awareness and market acceptance of our products and brands by our target markets: patriotic Americans and military service families. In addition, our business depends on acceptance by ecommerce and social media sales and distribution platforms that have the potential to provide incremental sales growth. If we are not successful in the growth of our brand and product offerings or obtaining the rights to other brands, we may not achieve and maintain satisfactory levels of acceptance by ecommerce and social media platforms and retail consumers. Any failure of our brands to maintain or increase acceptance or market penetration would likely have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial results.\n\n27  \n---  \n  \n**_Our brands’ images are keys to our business and any inability to maintain positive brand images could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations._**\n\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain a positive brand image for our existing products and effectively build up brand image for new products and brand extensions. We cannot predict whether our advertising, marketing and promotional programs will have the desired impact on our products’ branding and on consumer preferences. In addition, negative public relations and product quality issues, whether real or imagined, could tarnish our reputation and image of the affected brands and could cause consumers to choose other products. Our brand image can also be adversely affected by unfavorable reports, studies and articles or litigation involving our products or those of our competitors.\n\n**_If we fail to protect our trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, we may be unable to successfully market our products and compete effectively._**\n\nWe rely on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secrecy laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our brand and our reputation, and adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Further, enforcing or defending our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. We regard our intellectual property, particularly our trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, as crucial to our business and our success. However, the steps taken by us to protect these proprietary rights may not be adequate and may not prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our trademarks, copyrights trade secrets or similar proprietary rights. In addition, other parties may seek to assert infringement claims against us, and we may have to pursue litigation against other parties to assert our rights. Any such claim or litigation could be costly. Furthermore, any event that would jeopardize our proprietary rights or any claims of infringement by third parties could have a material adverse effect on our ability to market or sell our brands, profitably exploit our products or recoup our associated research and development costs.\n\n**_If we lose any of our key management personnel, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives._**\n\nOur future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our management and consultants. The Company’s operations and business strategy are dependent upon the knowledge and business experience of our executive officers and our consultants. We have entered into employment agreements with Maximiliano Ojeda, our Chief Executive Officer; Virginia Hilfiger, our Chief Brand Officer; and Julian Groves, our Chief Operating Officer. Nonetheless, if we were to lose the services of Mr. Ojeda, Ms. Hilfiger or Mr. Groves, our ability to manage our relationship with Stand Co. and create new products; as well as our ability to manage our operations, could be materially impaired. Although we hope to retain the services of all of our officers, if an officer should choose to leave us for any reason before we have hired additional personnel, our operations may suffer. If we should lose their services before we are able to engage and retain qualified employees and consultants to execute our business plan, we may not be able to continue to develop our business as quickly or efficiently.\n\nIn addition, we must be able to attract, train, motivate and retain highly skilled and experienced employees in order to successfully develop our business. Qualified employees often are in great demand and may be unavailable in the time frame required to satisfy our business requirements. We may not be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees in the future. The loss of personnel or our inability to hire or retain sufficient personnel at competitive rates of compensation could impair our ability to successfully grow our business. If we lose the services of any of our consultants, we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel, which could harm our business.\n\n**_Our management team has limited experience managing a public company, and regulatory compliance may divert its attention from the day-to-day management of our business._**\n\nThe individuals who now constitute our management team have limited experience managing a publicly-traded company and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and incremental reporting obligations under the federal securities laws. In particular, these new obligations will require substantial attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n28  \n---  \n  \n**_We depend on the continued growth of ecommerce._**\n\nThe business of selling products over the Internet is highly dynamic. If customers cease to find our website experience easy to use and offering good value, or otherwise lose interest in shopping in this manner, we may not acquire new customers at rates consistent with historical or projected periods, and existing customers’ buying patterns and levels may be less than historical or projected rates and our business, financial condition and operating results may suffer.\n\n**_If we fail to acquire new customers, we may not be able to increase net sales or achieve profitability._**\n\nWe have invested in marketing and branding related to customer acquisition and expect to continue to do so. We must continue to acquire customers in order to increase net sales and achieve profitability. In order to expand our customer base, we must appeal to and acquire customers who have historically used other means of commerce to purchase products and may prefer alternatives to our offerings, other retailers’ websites or the websites of our competitors. We cannot assure that the net sales from new customers we acquire will ultimately exceed the cost of acquiring those customers. If consumers do not perceive the products we offer to be of high value and quality, we may not be able to acquire new customers. If we are unable to acquire new customers who purchase products in numbers sufficient to grow our business, the net sales we generate may decrease, and our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe use social networking sites, such as Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, online services, search engines, affiliate marketing websites, directories and other social media websites and ecommerce businesses to advertise, market and direct potential customers to our site. As ecommerce and social networking continue to rapidly evolve, we must continue to use ecommerce and social media channels that are used by our current and prospective customers and cost-effectively drive traffic to our website. We believe that failure to utilize these channels as sources of traffic to our site to generate new customers would adversely affect our financial condition.\n\n**_Our reliance on logistics service providers, distributors, ecommerce and social media platforms, retailers and brokers could affect our ability to efficiently and profitably promote, sell, distribute and market our products, maintain our existing markets and expand our business into other geographic markets._**\n\nOur ability to maintain and expand our existing markets for our products, and to establish markets in new geographic distribution areas, is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain successful relationships with reliable logistics service providers, distributors, ecommerce and social media platforms, retailers and brokers strategically positioned to serve those areas. Most of our distributors, retailers and brokers promote, sell and distribute competing products, and our products may represent a small portion of their businesses. The success of our distribution network depends on the performance of the logistics service providers, distributors, ecommerce and social media platforms, retailers and brokers in our network. There is a risk they may not adequately perform their functions within the network by, without limitation, failing to distribute to sufficient retailers or positioning our products in localities that may not be receptive to our product. Our ability to incentivize and motivate distributors to manage and sell our products is affected by competition from other companies who have greater resources than we do. To the extent that our distributors, retailers and brokers are distracted from selling our products or do not employ sufficient efforts in managing and selling our products, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, such third parties’ financial position or market share may deteriorate, which could adversely affect our distribution, marketing and sales activities.\n\n**_We will be dependent on our suppliers and do not have supply agreements with our suppliers. Events adversely affecting our suppliers, manufacturers and contractors would adversely affect us._**\n\nIf we experience significantly increased sales and since we do not have supply agreements to ensure our requirements, there can be no assurance that additional products will be available when required or on terms that are favorable to us, or that a supplier would allocate sufficient products to us in order to meet our requirements or fill our orders in a timely manner which could lead to delays to our customers, which could hurt our relationships with our customers, result in negative publicity, damage our brand and adversely affect our business, prospects and operating results.\n\nWe intend to maintain a full supply chain for the provision of our products. Suppliers, manufacturers, service providers and contractors may elect, at any time, to decline or withdraw services necessary for our operations. Loss of these suppliers, manufacturers, service providers and contractors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, any significant interruption, negative change in the availability or economics of the supply chain or increase in the prices for the production of our products provided by any such third-party suppliers, manufacturers, service providers and contractors could materially impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Any inability to secure required supplies or to do so on appropriate terms could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n29  \n---  \n  \n**_Our sales may be adversely affected if we fail to respond to changes in consumer preferences in a timely manner or are not successful in expanding our product offerings._**\n\nOur financial performance depends on our ability to identify, originate and define retail product trends, as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner. Our products must appeal to a broad audience whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. Our business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences dictated in part by perceived product value and seasonal variations.\n\nWe may broaden our product offerings in the future. We continue to explore additional categories which may be accepted by our target customers. If we offer new products or categories that are not accepted by our customers, our sales may fall short of expectations, our brand and reputation could be adversely affected and we may incur expenses that are not offset by sales. If we expand into new categories, consumer demands may be different, and there is no assurance that we will be successful in these new categories. We may make substantial investments in such new categories in anticipation of future net sales. If the launch of a new category requires investments greater than we expect, if we are unable to attract vendors that produce sufficient high quality, value-oriented products or if the sales generated from a new category grow more slowly or produce lower gross margins than we expect, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\n\nExpansion of our brands and product lines may also strain our management and operational resources, specifically the need to hire and manage additional merchandise buyers to source these new products. We may also face greater competition in specific categories from Internet sites or retailers that are more focused on such categories. It may be difficult to differentiate our offering from other competitors as we offer additional product categories, and our customers may have additional considerations in deciding whether or not to purchase these additional product categories. In addition, the relative profitability, if any, of new product lines may be lower than what we have experienced historically, and we may not generate sufficient net sales from new product initiatives to recoup our investments in them. If any of these were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n**_Uncertainties in economic conditions and their impact on consumer spending patterns could adversely impact our operating results._**\n\nOur performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending. Some of the factors adversely affecting consumer spending include levels of unemployment, consumer debt levels, changes in net worth based on market changes and uncertainty, home foreclosures and changes in home values, fluctuating interest rates, credit availability, government actions, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty. Adverse economic changes in any of the regions in which we sell our products could reduce consumer confidence and could negatively affect net sales and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\n\n**_Failure to continue to provide our customers with merchandise from vendors will harm our business._**\n\nOur net sales depend, in part, on our ability to continue to source merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices from vendors. Offering a variety of styles, categories and products at affordable price points is important to our ability to acquire new customers and to keep our existing customers engaged and purchasing products. Growth in the number of our customers, as well as increased competition, may make it difficult to source additional brands and styles in sufficient quantities and on acceptable terms to meet the demand of our customers.\n\nWe have no contractual assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products, and vendors could change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us for future sales at any time. If we are not able to effectively promote our brand, we may lose customers to our competitors. Even if we identify new vendors, we may not be able to purchase desired merchandise in sufficient quantities on terms acceptable to us in the future, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors. An inability to purchase suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or to source new vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n30  \n---  \n  \n**_Failure of our vendors to supply high quality and compliant merchandise in a timely manner may damage our reputation and brand and harm our business._**\n\nWe depend on our vendors to supply high-quality merchandise in a timely manner. The failure of these vendors to supply merchandise which meets our quality standards or the quality standards of our customers could damage our reputation and harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nOur vendors are subject to various risks, including raw material costs, inflation, labor disputes, union organizing activities, boycotts, financial liquidity, product merchantability, safety issues, inclement weather, natural disasters, disruptions in exports, trade restrictions, trade disruptions, currency fluctuations and general economic and political conditions that could limit the ability of our vendors to provide us with high-quality merchandise on a timely basis and at prices and payment terms that are commercially acceptable. For these or other reasons, one or more of our vendors might not adhere to our vendor terms and conditions or their applicable contract or might stop providing us with high-quality merchandise. If there are any deficiencies in the products our vendors have provided to us, we might not identify such deficiencies before products ship to our customers.\n\nIn addition, our vendors may have difficulty adjusting to our changing demands and growing business. Failure of our vendors to provide us with quality merchandise that complies with all applicable laws, including product safety regulations and legislation in a timely and effective manner could damage our reputation and brand. Further, any merchandise could become subject to a recall, regulatory action or legal claim, which could result in increased legal expenses as well as damage to our reputation and brand and harm to our business. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States and other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type or effect of any such restrictions. Such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nWe purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and international manufacturers. Failure of our vendors to comply with applicable laws and regulations and contractual requirements could lead to litigation against us, resulting in increased legal expenses and costs.\n\n**_If we do not successfully optimize and manage our fulfillment processes, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed._**\n\nIf we do not optimize and manage our fulfillment processes successfully and efficiently, it could result in excess or insufficient fulfillment, an increase in costs or impairment charges or harm our business in other ways. If we do not have sufficient fulfillment capacity or experience a problem fulfilling orders in a timely manner, our customers may experience delays in receiving their purchases, which could harm our reputation and our relationship with our customers.\n\nIf we add new products or categories with different fulfillment requirements or change the mix in products that we sell, our fulfillment will become increasingly complex. Failure to successfully address such challenges in a cost-effective and timely manner could impair our ability to timely deliver our customers’ purchases and could harm our reputation and ultimately, our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nIf we grow faster than we anticipate, we may exceed our fulfillment center’s capacity, we may experience problems fulfilling orders in a timely manner or our customers may experience delays in receiving their purchases, which could harm our reputation and our relationship with our customers, and we would need to increase our capital expenditures more than anticipated.\n\n**_We are subject to payment-related risks._**\n\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, PayPal, gift cards and interest-free payments through Klarna. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with the rules or requirements of any provider of a payment method we accept, among other things, we may be subject to fines or higher transaction fees and may lose, or face restrictions placed upon, our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n31  \n---  \n  \nWe also may incur significant losses from fraud. We may incur losses from claims that the consumer did not authorize the purchase, from merchant fraud, from erroneous transmissions and from consumers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments. In addition to the direct costs of such losses, if they are related to credit card transactions and become excessive, they could potentially result in our losing the right to accept credit cards for payment. In addition, under current credit card practices, we are liable for fraudulent credit card transactions because we do not obtain a cardholder’s signature. We use a third-party fraud specialist to monitor our credit transactions. Our failure to adequately control fraudulent transactions could damage our reputation and brand and result in litigation or regulatory action, causing an increase in legal expenses and fees and substantially harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n**_Government regulation of the Internet and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and results of operations._**\n\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and e-commerce. Existing and future regulations and laws could impede the growth of the Internet, ecommerce or mobile commerce. These regulations and laws may involve taxes, tariffs, privacy and data security, anti-spam, content protection, electronic contracts and communications, consumer protection and gift cards. We cannot guarantee that our practices have complied, comply or will comply fully with all such laws and regulations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation, a loss in business and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Any such proceeding or action could hurt our reputation, force us to spend significant amounts in defense of these proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, decrease the use of our site by consumers and vendors and may result in the imposition of monetary liability. We may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with any such laws or regulations.\n\n**_Failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, or the expansion of current or the enactment of new laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, could adversely affect our business and our financial condition._**\n\nA variety of laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data. Laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and other legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, including those relating to the use of data for marketing purposes. It is possible, however, that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict with other rules or our practices. We cannot guarantee that our practices have complied or will comply fully with all such laws, regulations, requirements and obligations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations, industry self-regulatory principles, industry standards or codes could adversely affect our reputations, brand and business, and may result in claims, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other liabilities. Any such claim, proceeding or action could hurt our reputation, brand and business, force us to incur significant expenses in defense of such proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, result in a loss of customers and vendors and may result in the imposition of monetary liability. We may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with any laws, regulations or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection or any inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure of data that we store or handle as part of operating our business.\n\n**_Our failure or the failure of third-party service providers to protect our site, networks and systems against security breaches, or otherwise to protect our confidential information, could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business and operating results._**\n\nWe collect, maintain, transmit and store data about our customers, vendors and others, including credit card information and personally identifiable information, as well as other confidential and proprietary information. We also employ third-party service providers that store, process and transmit proprietary, personal and confidential information on our behalf. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties in an effort to securely transmit confidential and sensitive information, including credit card numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries or other developments may result in the whole or partial failure of this technology to protect transaction data or other confidential and sensitive information from being breached or compromised. More generally, we take steps to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect, store or transmit, but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts. Our security measures, and those of our third-party service providers, may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering, security breaches or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information. We and our service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent all types of attacks, and techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers. In addition, security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships.\n\n32  \n---  \n  \nAny compromise or breach of our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could violate applicable privacy, data security and other laws, and cause significant legal and financial exposure, adverse publicity and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse and material effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Although we maintain privacy, data breach and network security liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. We may need to devote significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches, diverting resources from the growth and expansion of our business.\n\n**_Breaches of our online commerce security could occur and could have an adverse effect on our reputation._**\n\nA significant barrier to online commerce and communications is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. There can be no assurance that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography and cybersecurity, or other events or developments will not result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by the Company to protect customer transaction data. If any such compromise of the Company’s security were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and, therefore, on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in the Company’s operations. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches. Concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the Internet and other online services and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the Internet and other online services generally, and the Web in particular, especially as a means of conducting commercial transactions. To the extent that activities of the Company involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information, security breaches could damage our reputation and expose the Company to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. There can be no assurance our security measures will prevent security breaches or that failure to prevent such security breaches will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition\n\n**_We may incur material losses and costs as a result of manufacturer’s product defects, warranty claims or product liability actions that may be brought against us._**\n\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability in the event that products that we sell fail to perform as expected or failure results in bodily injury or property damage which could cause us to lose revenues, incur increased costs associated with customer support, experience delays increased returns or discounts, and damage our reputation, all of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. If any of the products we sell are or are alleged to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products.\n\n**_Our ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from growing._**\n\nIn the future, we could be required to raise capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business. If we sell any such securities in subsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and could reduce our operational flexibility or profitability, such as covenants that could limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, liens or other encumbrances, make dividends or other distributions to holders of our capital stock, and sell or transfer assets, as well as certain financial covenants. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures.\n\n33  \n---  \n  \n**_The price of our Common Stock may rapidly fluctuate or may decline regardless of our operating performance, resulting in substantial losses for investors._**\n\nThe trading price of our Common Stock may be subject to instances of extreme stock price run-ups followed by rapid price declines and stock price volatility unrelated to both our actual and expected operating performance and financial condition or prospects, making it difficult for prospective investors to assess the rapidly changing value of our stock. Further, the trading price of our Common Stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including limited trading volume, actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations; the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections; failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our Company, changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our Company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors; announcements by us or our competitors of significant innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, operating results or capital commitments; changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other companies in our industry; price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole; changes in our Board or management; sales of large blocks of our Common Stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders; lawsuits threatened or filed against us; changes in laws or regulations applicable to our business; the expiration of lock-up agreements; changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of debt or equity securities; short sales, hedging and other derivative transactions involving our capital stock; general economic and geopolitical conditions, including the current or anticipated impact of military conflict and related sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and other countries due to Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine; and the other factors described in this section of the prospectus captioned \"_Risk Factors_.”\n\n**_Geopolitical conditions, including trade disputes and direct or indirect acts of war or terrorism, could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results._**\n\nOur operations could be disrupted by geopolitical conditions, trade disputes, international boycotts and sanctions, political and social instability, acts of war, terrorist activity or other similar events. From time to time, we could have a large number of customers located in a particular geographic region. Decreased demand from a discrete event impacting a region in which we have a concentrated exposure could negatively impact our results of operations.\n\nIn February 2022, Russia initiated significant military action against Ukraine. In response, the U.S. and certain other countries imposed significant sanctions and export controls against Russia, Belarus and certain individuals and entities connected to Russian or Belarusian political, business, and financial organizations, and the U.S. and certain other countries could impose further sanctions, trade restrictions, and other retaliatory actions should the conflict continue or worsen. It is not possible to predict the broader consequences of the conflict, including related geopolitical tensions, and the measures and retaliatory actions taken by the U.S. and other countries in respect thereof as well as any counter measures or retaliatory actions by Russia or Belarus in response, including, for example, potential cyberattacks or the disruption of energy exports, is likely to cause regional instability, geopolitical shifts, and could materially adversely affect global trade, currency exchange rates, regional economies and the global economy. In addition, the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East may further impact global economic conditions and market sentiments. This, in turn, could adversely affect the trading price of our shares of Common Stock and investor interest in us. The outcome of the Russia-Ukraine war and conflicts in the Middle East remain uncertain, and while it is difficult to predict the impact of any of the foregoing, the conflict and actions taken in response to the conflict could increase our costs, disrupt our supply chain, reduce our sales and earnings, impair our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n**_We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk._**\n\nIf the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues and operating expenses. Similarly, our net revenues and operating expenses will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies. As we expand our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations will become more pronounced. We may enter into short-term currency forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities recorded in non-functional currencies. The use of such hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates.\n\n34  \n---  \n  \n**_Climate change may negatively affect our business._**\n\nThere is growing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures may cause an adverse change in weather patterns around the globe resulting in an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions may disrupt the operation of our supply chain or impact demand for our products. In addition, the increasing concern over climate change may result in more regional, federal and global legal and regulatory requirements and could result in increased production and transportation costs. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\n**Risks Associated with MGO’s Capital Stock**\n\n**_We may not be able to maintain a listing of our Common Stock on Nasdaq._**\n\nWe must meet certain financial and liquidity criteria to maintain such listing. If we fail to meet any of Nasdaq’s continued listing standards or we violate Nasdaq listing requirements, our Common Stock may be delisted. In addition, our board of directors may determine that the cost of maintaining our listing on a national securities exchange outweighs the benefits of such listing. A delisting of our Common Stock from Nasdaq may materially impair our stockholders’ ability to buy and sell our Common Stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our Common Stock. The delisting of our Common Stock could significantly impair our ability to raise capital and the value of your investment.\n\n**_The market price of our securities may be volatile and may fluctuate in a way that is disproportionate to our operating performance._**\n\nOur securities may experience substantial volatility as a result of a number of factors, including, among others:\n\n● | sales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock;  \n---|---  \n● | announcements about us or about our competitors or new product introductions;  \n● | developments concerning our product manufacturers and suppliers;  \n● | governmental regulation and legislation;  \n● | variations in our anticipated or actual operating results;  \n● | changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our performance, or our failure to meet analysts’ expectations, if/when applicable;  \n● | foreign currency values and fluctuations; and  \n● | overall political and economic conditions.  \n  \nMany of these factors are beyond our control. The stock markets have historically experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These broad market and industry factors could reduce the market price of our securities, regardless of our actual operating performance.\n\n**_We do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our shares of Common Stock. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain._**\n\nWe intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them at a price higher than that which they initially paid for such shares. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, from the sale of our Common Stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\n\n**_We incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public reporting company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to regulatory compliance initiatives._**\n\nAs a public company, we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and other applicable securities rules and regulations. As a public reporting company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses not otherwise incurred by a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and have made some activities more time consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations will continue to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to maintain director and officer liability insurance.\n\n35  \n---  \n  \n**_If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our shares or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, the price of our securities and trading volume could decline._**\n\nThe trading market for our securities will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, the price of our securities could decline.\n\n**_We are an \"emerging growth company” and a \"smaller reporting company” under the JOBS Act, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies will make our Common Stock less attractive to investors._**\n\nWe are an \"emerging growth company” and a \"smaller reporting company” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \"emerging growth companies” and \"smaller reporting companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\n\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \"emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \"emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\n\nWe will remain an \"emerging growth company” until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our Common Stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed $1.235 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period, or if the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.\n\nWe may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as (i) the market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates is equal to or less than $250 million as of the last business day of the most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (ii) our annual revenues is equal to or less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates is equal to or less than $700 million as of the last business day of the most recently completed second fiscal quarter.\n\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our Common Stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Common Stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Common Stock and our stock price may be more volatile. In addition, taking advantage of reduced disclosure obligations may make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible. If investors are unable to compare our business with other companies in our industry, we may not be able to raise additional capital as and when we need it, which may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n36  \n---  \n  \n**Risks Related to This Offering**\n\n**_This is a reasonable best efforts offering, with no minimum amount of securities required to be sold, and we may sell fewer than all of the securities offered hereby._**\n\nThe placement agent has agreed to use its best efforts to solicit offers to purchase the shares of Common Stock and Pre-funded Warrants in this offering. The placement agent has no obligation to buy any of the securities from us or to arrange for the purchase or sale of any specific number or dollar amount of the securities. There is no required minimum number of securities that must be sold as a condition to completion of this offering. As there is no minimum offering amount required as a condition to the closing of this offering, the actual offering amount, placement agent fees and proceeds to us are not presently determinable and may be substantially less than the maximum amounts set forth above. We may sell fewer than all of the securities offered hereby, which may significantly reduce the amount of proceeds received by us, and investors in this offering will not receive a refund in the event that we do not sell all of the shares of Common Stock and Pre-funded Warrants offered in this offering. The success of this offering will impact our ability to use the proceeds to execute our business plans. We may have insufficient capital to implement our business plans and satisfy current obligations, potentially resulting in greater operating losses or dilution unless we are able to raise the required capital from alternative sources. There is no assurance that alternative capital, if needed, would be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\n\n**_You will experience immediate dilution in the net tangible book value per share of the Common Stock you purchase, and may experience additional dilution in the future._**\n\nBecause the effective price per share of Common Stock being offered hereby or issuable upon exercise of the Pre-funded Warrants being offered may be higher than the net tangible book value per share of our Common Stock, you may experience dilution to the extent of the difference between the effective offering price per share of Common Stock you pay in this offering and the net tangible book value per share of our Common Stock immediately after this offering. Assuming the sale of 2,100,840 shares of Common Stock at a public offering price of $2.38 per share and our net tangible book value as of September 30, 2024, assuming no sale of any Pre-funded Warrants in this offering, and after deducting the placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us, you will incur immediate dilution in as adjusted net tangible book value of approximately $0.97 per share. As a result of the dilution to investors purchasing securities in this offering, investors may receive less than the purchase price paid in this offering, if anything, in the event of the liquidation of our company. See the section entitled \"**Dilution** ” below for a more detailed discussion of the dilution you will incur if you participate in this offering.\n\n**_We have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds we receive from this offering and may not use them effectively._**\n\nOur management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds we receive in this offering, including for any of the purposes described in the section entitled \"**Use of Proceeds** ,” and you will not have the opportunity as part of your investment decision to assess whether our management is using the net proceeds appropriately. Because of the number and variability of factors that will determine our use of our net proceeds from this offering, their ultimate use may vary substantially from their currently intended use. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business and cause the price of our Common Stock to decline. Pending their use, we may invest our net proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. These investments may not yield a favorable return to our stockholders.\n\n**_An active trading market for our shares may not be sustained._**\n\nAlthough our shares are listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC, the market for our shares has demonstrated varying levels of trading activity. The current level of trading may not be sustained in the future. The lack of an active market for our shares may impair investors’ ability to sell their shares at the time they wish to sell them or at a price that they consider reasonable, may reduce the fair market value of their shares and may impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire additional intellectual property assets by using our shares as consideration.\n\n**_This offering may cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decrease._**\n\nThe number of shares of Common Stock we propose to issue and ultimately will issue if this offering is completed, may result in an immediate decrease in the market price of our Common Stock. This decrease may continue after the completion of this offering. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that the availability of shares for future sale represented by the Pre-funded Warrants issued in connection with the offering will have on the market price of our Common Stock from time to time.\n\n37  \n---  \n  \n**_Future sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock._**\n\nWe may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. If additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, or perceptions that those sales could occur, the issuance of these securities could result in further dilution to investors purchasing our Common Stock in this offering or result in downward pressure on the price of our Common Stock, and our ability to raise capital in the future.\n\n**_There is no public market for the Pre-funded Warrants being offered by us in this offering._**\n\nThere is no established public trading market for the Pre-funded Warrants, and we do not expect a market to develop. In addition, we do not intend to apply to list the Pre-funded Warrants on any national securities exchange or other nationally recognized trading system. Without an active market, the liquidity of the Pre-funded Warrants will be limited.\n\n**_Except as otherwise set forth in the Pre-funded Warrants, holders of the Pre-funded Warrants offered hereby will have no rights as stockholders with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying the Pre-funded Warrants until such holders exercise their Pre-funded Warrants and acquire our Common Stock._**\n\nExcept as otherwise set forth in the Pre-funded Warrants, until holders of the Pre-funded Warrants acquire shares of our Common Stock upon exercise thereof, such holders of the Pre-funded Warrants will have no rights with respect to the shares of our Common Stock underlying such warrants, such as voting rights. Upon exercise of the Pre-funded Warrants, as the case may be, the holder will be entitled to exercise the rights of a Common Stockholder only as to matters for which the record date occurs after the exercise date.\n\n**_Purchasers who purchase our securities in this offering pursuant to a securities purchase agreement may have rights not available to purchasers that purchase without the benefit of a securities purchase agreement._**\n\nIn addition to rights and remedies available to all purchasers in this offering under federal securities and state law, the purchasers that enter into a securities purchase agreement will also be able to bring claims for breach of contract against us. The ability to pursue a claim for breach of contract provides those investors with the means to enforce the covenants uniquely available to them under the securities purchase agreement including timely delivery of shares and indemnification for breach of contract.\n\n**_Since we do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future, investors may be forced to sell their stock in order to obtain a return on their investment._**\n\nWe do not anticipate declaring or paying in the foreseeable future any cash dividends on our capital stock. Instead, we plan to retain any earnings to finance our operations and plans discussed elsewhere in this prospectus. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Common Stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any return on their investment. As a result, investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our Common Stock.\n\n**_The trading price of our Common Stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control._**\n\nOur share price is highly volatile. During the period from August 1, 2024, to November 18, 2024 the closing price of our Common Stock (on a post-reverse split basis) ranged from a high of $6.99 per share (as adjusted for the reverse split) to a low of $2.06 per share (as adjusted for the reverse split). The stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, you may not be able to sell your Common Stock at or above the public offering price and you may lose some or all of your investment.\n\n**IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE RISKS, BUSINESSES ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO RISKS NOT FORESEEN OR FULLY APPRECIATED BY MANAGEMENT. IN REVIEWING THIS FILING, POTENTIAL INVESTORS SHOULD KEEP IN MIND THAT OTHER POSSIBLE RISKS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY’S SECURITIES.**\n\n38  \n---  \n  \n**SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS**\n\nThis prospectus contains \"forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements reflect our management’s current view about future events. When used in this prospectus, the words \"anticipate,” \"believe,” \"estimate,” \"expect,” \"future,” \"intend,” \"plan,” or the negative of these terms and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our management, identify forward-looking statements. Such statements, include, but are not limited to, statements contained in this prospectus relating to our business strategy, our future operating results and liquidity and capital resources outlook. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward–looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees of assurance of future performance. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation:\n\n● | current economic conditions, including consumer spending levels and the price elasticity of our products;  \n---|---  \n● | the highly competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we compete;  \n● | our ability to successfully manage social, political, economic legal and other conditions affecting our operations and our supply chain sources, such as political instability and acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters, disruption of markets, operational disruptions, changes in import or export laws, currency restrictions and currency exchange rate fluctuations;  \n● | the impact of the loss of one or more of our suppliers of finished goods or raw materials;  \n● | our ability to manage our inventory effectively and reduce inventory reserves;  \n● | our ability to optimize our global supply chain;  \n● | our ability to distribute our products effectively through our ecommerce store and through our growing wholesale distribution channel;  \n● | our ability to keep pace with changing consumer preferences;  \n● | the impact of any inadequacy, interruption or failure with respect to our information technology or any data security breach;  \n● | our ability to protect our reputation and the reputation and images of our licensed and any future proprietary brand(s);  \n● | unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or a change in our ability to realize deferred tax benefits;  \n● | our ability to comply with environmental and other laws and regulations;  \n● | changes in our relationship with our employees and costs and adverse publicity from violations of labor or environmental laws by us or our suppliers;  \n● | our ability to attract and retain key personnel;   \n● | our ability to integrate and grow potential acquisitions successfully; and  \n● | other factors (including the risks contained in the section of this prospectus entitled \"_Risk Factors_ ”) relating to our industry, our operations and results of operations  \n  \nShould one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended or planned.\n\nFactors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.\n\n39  \n---  \n  \n**USE OF PROCEEDS**\n\nWe estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $4,439,584 (assuming the sale of all share of Common Stock offered hereby at the assumed public offering price of $2.38 per share, which represents the closing sale price of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC on November 19, 2024), after deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us, and assuming no sale of any Pre-funded Warrants offered hereunder. However, because this is a best efforts offering with no minimum number of securities or amount of proceeds as a condition to closing, the actual offering amount, placement agent fees and net proceeds to us are not presently determinable and may be substantially less than the maximum amounts set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and we may not sell all or any of the securities we are offering. As a result, we may receive significantly less in net proceeds. Based on the assumed offering price set forth above, we estimate that our net proceeds from the sale of 75% or 50% of the shares of Common Stock offered in this offering would be approximately $3,289,584 and $2,139,584 respectively, after deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us.\n\nThe following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will raise the full $5,000,000 as anticipated and there is no guarantee that we will receive any proceeds from the offering. All amounts included in the table below are estimates.\n\nDescription | If 50% of securities offered are sold | If 75% of securities offered are sold | If 100% of securities offered are sold  \n---|---|---|---  \nGross proceeds | **$**| **2,500,000** | **$**| **3,750,000** | **$**| **5,000,000**  \nPlacement Agent fees | 200,000 | 300,000 | 400,000  \nOffering expenses | 160,416 | $| 160,416 | $| 160,416  \n**Net proceeds** | **$**| **2,139, 584** | **$**| **3,289, 584** | **$**| **4,439, 584**  \nWorking Capital | 259,584 | 909,584 | 2,059,584  \nBusiness Combination Expense | 880,000 | 880,000 | 880,000  \nSeverance Payments | 1,000,000 | 1,500,000 | 1,500,000  \nTotal | 2,139,584 | 3,289,584 | 4,439,584  \n  \n**DIVIDEND POLICY**\n\nWe have never declared any cash dividends since inception, and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Instead, we anticipate that all of our earnings will be used to provide working capital, to support our operations, and to finance the growth and development of our business. The payment of dividends is within the discretion of the Board and will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, prospects, applicable Delaware law, which provides that dividends are only payable out of surplus or current net profits, and other factors our Board might deem relevant. There are no restrictions that currently limit our ability to pay dividends on our Common Stock other than those generally imposed by applicable state law.\n\n**MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS**\n\nOur Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq under the symbol \"MGOL.”\n\nWe have 2,904,001 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding held by 28 stockholders of record.\n\n40  \n---  \n  \n**Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Incentive Plan**\n\nOn August 15, 2022, our Board and our stockholders approved the MGO Global Inc. 2022 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2022 Plan. The 2022 Plan governs equity awards to our employees, directors, officers, consultants and other eligible participants. Initially, the maximum number of shares of our Common Stock that may be subject to awards under the 2022 Plan was 218,647. The maximum number of shares that are subject to awards under the 2022 Plan is subject to an annual increase equal to the lesser of (i) 50,000 shares of our Common Stock, (ii) a number of shares of our Common Stock equal to 4% of the prior year’s maximum number or (iii) such number of shares of our Common Stock as determined by the 2022 Plan administrator. The 2022 Plan was made effective on January 11, 2023.\n\nThe types of awards permitted under the 2022 Plan include nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and other awards. Each option shall be exercisable at such times and subject to such terms and conditions as the 2022 Plan administrator may specify.\n\nThe 2022 Plan administrator has the authority to amend, suspend or terminate the 2022 Plan provided such action does not impair the existing rights of any participant. The 2022 Plan automatically will terminate on August 15, 2032, unless it is terminated sooner.\n\nOn April 12, 2024, the Board unanimously authorized and approved an amendment (\"Plan Amendment”) to MGO’s 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2022 Plan”) to increase the number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock, par value $0.00001 per share, (\"Common Stock”) reserved for issuance under the 2022 Plan by an additional 182,541 shares of Common Stock. Such an increase will result in a total of 451,188 shares of Common Stock being reserved under the 2022 Plan, of which 205,071 will be available for future awards. On April 17, 2024 (the \"Record Date”), a majority of our stockholders consented to the Plan Amendment. In accordance with Rule 14c-2 of the Exchange Act, corporate actions described above went effective twenty (20) days after a Schedule 14C Information Statement was mailed to our stockholders on April 29, 2024.\n\n**CAPITALIZATION**\n\nThe following table shows our cash and cash equivalents and capitalization as of September 30, 2024 as follows:\n\n● | on an actual basis;  \n---|---  \n● | on a pro forma as adjusted basis to give further effect to our issuance and sale of 2,100,840 shares of our Common Stock in this offering (assuming the maximum amount of is sold and no sale of any Pre-Funded Warrants) at a public offering price of $2.38 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us of $4,439,584, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable.  \n  \nThe pro forma information below is illustrative only and our capitalization following the completion of this offering is subject to adjustment based on the public offering price of our Common Stock and other terms of this offering determined at pricing. You should read the following table in conjunction with \"_Use of Proceeds_ ,” \"_Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations_ ” and our financial statements and related notes included in this prospectus.\n\n41  \n---  \n  \n**Actual as of September 30, 2024** | **Pro forma as Adjusted**  \n---|---  \n**Cash and cash equivalents** | $ | 1,435,288 | $ | 5,874,872  \n**Long-term debt** | $ | - | $ | -  \n**Total long-term debt** | $ | - | $ | -  \n**Stockholders’ equity:**  \nPreferred stock, $0.00001 par value, 20,000,000 shares authorized, and 0 shares issued and outstanding, actual; 0 issued and outstanding pro forma as adjusted | $ | - | $ | -  \nCommon stock, $0.00001 par value, 150,000,000 shares authorized, actual, and pro forma, as adjusted; 2,904,001 shares issued and outstanding, actual; and 5,004,841, pro forma as adjusted | 29 | 79  \nAdditional paid-in capital | 19,874,872 | 24,314,406  \nAccumulated deficit | (16,884,132 | ) | (16,884,132 | )   \nTotal MGO stockholders’ equity | 2,990,769 | 7,430,353  \nNon-controlling interest | (359,370 | ) | (359,370 | )  \nTotal stockholders’ equity | 2,631,399 | 7,070,983  \n**Total capitalization** | $ | 4,066,687 | $ | 7,070,983  \n  \n**DILUTION**\n\nIf you invest in our Common Stock in this offering, your ownership interest will be diluted immediately to the extent of the difference between the public offering price per share of our Common Stock and the as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our Common Stock immediately after this offering.\n\nOur historical net tangible book value (deficit) as of September 30, 2024, was 2,631,399. Our historical net tangible book value (deficit) is the amount of our total tangible assets less our total liabilities. Our historical net tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2024, was $0.91. Historical net tangible book value per share represents historical net tangible book value (deficit) divided by the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding as of September 30, 2024.\n\nAfter giving effect to our issuance and sale of 2,100,840 shares of Common Stock in this offering at an assumed public offering price of $2.38 per share (the closing sale price of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC on November 19, 2024), assuming no sale of any Pre-Funded Warrants in this offering and after deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of September 30, 2024 would have been approximately $7,070,983, or approximately $1.41 per share. This represents an immediate increase in actual net tangible book value per share of $0.50 to our existing stockholders and an immediate dilution in actual net tangible book value per share of approximately $0.97 to new investors purchasing Common Stock in this offering. Dilution per share to new investors purchasing Common Stock in this offering is determined by subtracting as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering from the public offering price per share paid by new investors.\n\nThe following table illustrates this dilution on a per share basis:\n\nAssumed Public offering price per share | $| 2.38  \n---|---|---  \nActual net tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2024 | $| 0.91  \nIncrease in actual net tangible book value (deficit) per share as of September 30, 2024 | 0.50  \nPro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering | $| 1.41  \nDilution per share to new investors purchasing shares in this offering | $ | 0.97  \n  \nIf we only sell 75% or 50% of the maximum offering amount, our as adjusted net tangible book value after this offering would be $5,920,983, or $4,770,983, respectively, and the dilution per share to investors purchasing securities in this offering would be $1.06 or $1.17, respectively, assuming no Pre-Funded Warrants are sold and after deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us.\n\nThe information discussed above is illustrative only and will be adjusted based on the actual public offering price, the actual number of units that we offer in this offering, and other terms of this offering determined at the time of pricing. The foregoing discussion and table assumes no sale of Pre-Funded Warrants, which if sold, would reduce the number of shares that we are offering on a one-for-one basis. In addition, we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of these securities could result in further dilution to our stockholders.\n\n42  \n---  \n  \n**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF**\n\n**FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**\n\n_The following discussion and analysis summarize the significant factors affecting our operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of our Company as of and for the periods presented below.

The _Messi Brand_ is a premium lifestyle brand with a sporty edge and sold their products direct to consumers through the website www.themessistore.com.\n\nOn October 29, 2018, MGOTeam1 entered into a Trademark License Agreement with Leo Messi Management SL (\"LMM”). LMM granted MGOTeam1 a worldwide non-exclusive license in order to use Leo Messi’s trademarks with the purpose of developing, manufacturing, trading and promoting _Messi Brand_ Products.\n\nOn November 20, 2021, MGOTeam1 entered into a new Trademark License Agreement (the \"Messi License”) with LMM to have the worldwide license to use Leo Messi’s trademarks for the purpose of developing, manufacturing, marketing and promoting his products. MGOTeam1 was to pay LMM a minimum guaranteed amount on account of royalties amounting to Four Million Euros (€4,000,000) over the four-year agreement, net of taxes with the last payment due on November 15, 2024.\n\nOn March 21, 2024, MGOTeam1 assigned the Messi License to Centric Brands LLC (\"Centric”), which paid MGOTeam1 $2,000,000 in cash and assumed the obligation to pay the minimum guaranteed amount due to LMM in 2024.\n\n**_Business Combination Agreement with Heidmar, Inc._**\n\nOn June 18, 2024, MGO entered into a definitive Business Combination Agreement (the \"Business Combination Agreement” or \"BCA”) with Heidmar, Inc., (\"Heidmar”), a company organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Heidmar Maritime Holdings Corp., a company organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (\"Holdings”), HMR Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings (\"Merger Sub”), and Rhea Marine Ltd. and Maistros Shipinvest Corp (collectively, the \"Heidmar Shareholders”). The Company, Merger Sub, Holdings, Heidmar and Heidmar Shareholders are sometimes referred to herein individually as a \"Party” and, collectively, as the \"Parties.”\n\nPursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, MGO, Heidmar, Holdings, Merger Sub and the Heidmar Shareholders will effect a business combination involving the following Transactions (collectively, the \"Business Combination”):\n\n(a) | Merger Sub will merge (the \"Merger”) with and into MGO, with MGO continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings;  \n---|---  \n(b) | all of the issued and outstanding MGO Shares prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into the right to receive Holdings Shares on a one-for-one basis at the closing of the Business Combination;  \n(c) | immediately after the effective time of the Merger, the Heidmar Shareholders will transfer all their Heidmar Shares to Holdings (the \"Heidmar Share Acquisition”), with Heidmar becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings; and  \n(a) | Holdings will issue to the Heidmar Shareholders and MGO’s financial advisor: (i) at the Closing (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), the Heidmar Share Consideration (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), and (ii) after the Closing and upon the satisfaction of certain earnout conditions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement, the Earnout Shares (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), with 2.64% of each issuance being distributed to MGO’s financial advisor.  \n  \nFollowing the Closing, both MGO and Heidmar will be wholly owned subsidiaries of Holdings, and the Holdings Shares will be publicly listed on Nasdaq. The parties expect that after the Closing, the Heidmar Shareholders will own 94.34% of Holdings (including amounts to be distributed to MGO’s financial advisor) and the MGO stockholders will own 5.66% of Holdings, without taking into account the issuance of any Earnout Shares. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, any shares of common stock that MGO issues prior to the Closing will not change these percentages.\n\n44  \n---  \n  \nThe boards of directors of both companies have unanimously approved the signing of the BCA. The Business Combination is expected to close late in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to satisfying certain customary closing conditions, including the receipt of approvals from MGO’s stockholders and the listing of Holdings registered common shares on Nasdaq.

The decrease over the prior year’s comparable period is attributable to the fact that the Company reduced marketing expenses during the third quarter of 2024 in an effort to increase profitability while consciously reducing marketing costs, which helped in successfully increasing gross margin. Revenues reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $2,661,253, representing an 5.7% decrease over revenues of $2,823,601 posted for the comparable nine-month period in 2023. The modest decrease over the prior year’s comparable three and nine month periods is primarily attributable to the decrease in marketing spend in the third quarter of 2024, as noted above.\n\n_Cost of Sales and Gross Profit_\n\nCost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 decreased 69.2% to $72,414 from $235,003, respectively. This resulted in a gross profit of $492,986 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which compared to $819,158 for the same three-month period in 2023. Gross profit margin rose to 88.0% from 78.0% on a comparable three-month basis.\n\nCost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $586,502, down 23.0% from $761,473 reported for the same nine-month period in the prior year. This resulted in a 0.6% increase in gross profit of $2,074,751 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2,062,128 for the nine-month ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit margin rose to 78.0% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 from 73.0% reported for the same nine-month period in the prior year.\n\n45  \n---  \n  \n_Operating Expenses_\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, total operating expenses decreased 35.1% to $1,850,717 as compared to total operating expenses of $2,850,658 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to a 24.0% decline in selling, general and administrative expenses, which decreased to $1,386,146 from $1,827,926, respectively, primarily due to a reduction in stock-based compensation expense in the third quarter of 2024 versus the same period in 2023; and a 54.6% decrease in marketing and e-commerce expenses, which declined to $464,571 from $1,022,732, respectively. The decrease in marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior year’s same three-month period is attributable to the fact that the Company made cognitive efforts to focus on a higher return on marketing spend. In addition, warehouse and shipping costs decreased from the prior year due to one-time expenditures in 2023 of shipping the licensed goods to the Company’s new third-party fulfillment center.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was $7,738,241, representing a 36.0% increase compared to $5,688,343 in total operating expenses for the same nine months in 2023. The increase was largely attributable to a 71.8% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, which rose to $5,711,978 from $3,325,737, respectively; and a 14.2% decrease in marketing and e-commerce expenses, which declined to $2,026,263 from $2,362,606, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related to workforce expansion, stock-based compensation expenses which were not occurring in the prior six month period of 2023, and increased costs of legal and accounting expenses pertaining to executing capital raises and advancing the business combination process with Heidmar during the first nine months of 2024. The decrease in marketing and e-commerce expenses is due to the Company making a cognitive effort to focus on higher returns on marketing spend during 2024.\n\n_Other (Income) Expenses_\n\nTotal other income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $10,927 and $10,463, respectively, compared to total other interest income of $0 and $29,876 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\n\n_Net Loss_\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, net loss from continuing operations was $1,346,804, a 33.7% decrease from a net loss of $2,031,500 reported for the same three-month period in 2023. Net income from discontinued operations increased to $44,237 from a net loss of $520,613 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Overall, net loss totaled $1,302,567 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $2,552,113 for the same three-month period ended September 30, 2023. After factoring net income of $5,229 and a net loss of $62,800 for non-controlling interest for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, net loss attributable to MGO stockholders was $1,307,796, or $0.52 loss per share, and $2,489,313, or $1.79 loss per share, respectively.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net loss from continuing operations was $5,653,027, a 57.2% increase from a net loss of $3,596,339 reported for the same nine-month period in 2023. Net income from discontinued operations rose to $1,938,008 from a net loss of $1,574,104 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as a result of the assignment of the Messi License to Centric. Overall, net loss totaled $3,715,019 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $5,170,443 posted for the same nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. After factoring net income of $229,073 and a net loss of $185,556 for non-controlling interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, net loss attributable to MGO stockholders was $3,944,092, or $1.90 loss per share, and $4,984,887, or $3.67 loss per share, respectively.\n\n46  \n---  \n  \n**Cash Flows**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, cash on hand from continuing operations was $1,435,288, as compared to $836,446 as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 72%. The increase was primarily attributable to the assignment of the _Messi Brand_ to Centric in exchange for $2,000,000 in cash and their assumption of our obligation to pay €1.5 million in royalty payments to LMM in 2024, as well as net proceeds aggregating $3,215,752 received from the sale of our common stock pursuant to our At-The-Market Offering (\"ATM”). Until such time that the Company fully implements its growth strategy or completes its business combination with Heidmar, it expects to continue generating operating losses in the foreseeable future, primarily due to higher corporate overhead, higher marketing and inventory expenses and costs associated with being a public company.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operations was $4,715,475, a decrease of 26% as compared to cash used in operations of $6,396,563 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to the assignment of the _Messi Brand_ to Centric in exchange for $2,000,000 in cash and their assumption of our obligation to pay €1.5 million in royalty payments to Leo Messi Management in 2024.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by investing activities was $1,999,488, compared to cash used in investing activities of $179,853 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 1212% increase was due to no significant purchases of property and equipment occurring during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, offset by the $2,000,000 in proceeds received from the assignment of the _Messi Brand_ to Centric.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by financing activities was $3,218,540, a decrease of 61% as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $8,183,514 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was directly related to the completion of the Company’s initial public offering in January 2023.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of $2,393,015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a loss from continuing operations of $5,653,027, inclusive of $5,711,978 for general and administrative expenses, including higher workforce expenses, stock-based compensation expense, third-party logistics services, professional fees and rent expense for office space, as well as $2,026,263 for marketing and ecommerce expenses.\n\nOn March 21, 2024, MGO assigned the Messi License to Centric, which paid the Company $2,000,000 in cash and assumed the obligation to pay the minimum guaranteed amount due to LMM in 2024. Effective as of that date, the Company discontinued operations on _The Messi Store_.\n\nOn February 12, 2024, the SEC deemed the Company’s shelf registration statement on Form S-3 effective. This registration statement contained two prospectuses: 1) a base prospectus that covers the potential offering, issuance, and sale from time to time of our common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities and units in one or more offerings with a total value of up to $100,000,000; and 2) a sales agreement prospectus (\"ATM”) covering the potential offering, issuance, and sale from time to time of shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1,650,000 pursuant to an equity distribution agreement with Maxim Group LLC. On June 7, 2024, MGO entered into an Amendment No. 1 (\"Amendment”) to the equity distribution agreement for the ATM whereby the offering size was amended to reflect an increase in the aggregate gross sales price from $1,650,000 to $3,389,384. As of November 14, 2024, the Company had received net proceeds of $3,215,752 from sales of shares of our common stock pursuant to the ATM and has exhausted the ATM.\n\nIf the Company is unable to generate significant sales growth in the near term and raise additional capital, there is a risk that the Company could default on additional obligations; and could be required to discontinue or significantly reduce the scope of its operations if no other means of financing operations are available. Moreover, any additional equity financing that we obtain may dilute the ownership held by our existing shareholders. The economic dilution to our shareholders will be significant if our stock price does not materially increase, or if the effective price of any sale is below the price paid by a particular shareholder. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities or any other adjustment that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. As such, the aforementioned factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period.\n\n47  \n---  \n  \n**_Year Ended December 31, 2023 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022_**\n\nThe following table provides certain selected financial information for the periods presented:\n\nDecember 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | $ Change | % Change  \n---|---|---|---  \nRevenue, net | $| 3,668,926 | $| - | $| 3,668,926 | 100| %  \nCost of sales | 969,045 | - | 969,045 | 100| %  \nGross profit | 2,699,881 | - | 2,699,881 | 100| %  \nGross profit percentage | 73,58| % | 0| %  \nTotal operating expenses | 8,220,788 | 177,742 | 8,043,046 | 4,525| %  \nOperating loss | (5,520,907| ) | (177,742| ) | (5,343,165| ) | 3,006| %  \nTotal other (income) expenses | (37,281| ) | 186,760 | (224,401| ) | (120| )%  \nNet loss from continuing operations | $| (5,483,626| ) | $| (364,502| ) | $| (5,119,124| ) | 1,404| %  \nNet loss from discontinued operations | (1,886,839| ) | (2,512,855| ) | 626,016 | 25| %  \nNet loss | (7,370,465| ) | (2,877,357| ) | (4,493,108| ) | 156| %  \nLess: net loss attributable to non-controlling interest | (227,061| ) | (294,411| ) | 67,530 | (23| )%  \nNet loss attributable to MGO stockholders | $| (7,143,404| ) | $| (2,582,946| ) | $| (4,560,458| ) | 177| %  \n  \nRevenues\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net revenues were $3,668,926 as compared to $0 reported for the year ended December 31, 2022.

The increase was primarily due to a significant increase in marketing and e-commerce expenses coupled with payroll & independent contractor expenses related to the launch of the Stand Flagpole brand, stock-based compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock units and higher legal, accounting and specialty consulting expenses associated with public company overhead expenses resulting from the Company completing its Initial Public Offering in mid-January 2023.\n\nOther (Income) Expenses\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, total other income of $37,281 increased 120% to other expense of $186,760 reported for the prior year. Total other income was primarily associated with interest income on cash balances and remeasurement of foreign currency transactions into U.S. dollars and recorded as finance charges.\n\n48  \n---  \n  \nNet Loss\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net loss from continuing operations was $5,483,626, a 1,404% increase over the net loss of $364,502 reported for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net loss from discontinued operations declined to $1,886,839 from a net loss of $2,512,855 for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Overall, net loss totaled $7,370,465 for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is compared to a net loss of $2,877,357 posted for the year ended December 31, 2022. After factoring net loss of $227,061 and $294,411 for non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, total net loss attributable to MGO stockholders was $7,143,404 or $5.01 loss per share, and $2,582,946, or $2.45 loss per share, respectively.\n\n**Cash Flows**\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, cash on hand was $836,446 as compared to $32,275 as of December 31, 2022.

The increase in cash used in operating activities was mainly driven by an increase in operating loss primarily driven by additional operating costs for _Stand Flagpoles_ operating segment and public company overhead costs, purchases of inventory, decrease in accrued payroll expense and an increase in prepaid expenses over the prior year.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, cash used in our investing activities was $325,964 and $0, respectively.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, cash provided by financing activities was $8,125,711, an increase of $6,416,389 as compared to cash provided by financing activities totaling $1,709,322 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the amount of funds raised in the IPO and exercises of warrants in conjunction with the IPO in January 2023, net of expenses of $1,065,145.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had positive working capital of $602,286. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred a loss from continuing operations of $5,483,626, inclusive of $3,140,371 for marketing and e-commerce expenses, and $5,080,417 for general and administrative fees, including professional fees primarily associated with becoming a public company, namely legal, audit, accounting, SEC reporting, Nasdaq listing and specialized consultants. This compared to a loss from continuing operations as of December 31, 2022 of $364,502, inclusive of $177,742 of selling, general and administrative expenses and $186,760 for financing expenses.\n\nSubsequent to the end of 2023, we filed the S-3 in respect of the ATM. As of October 4, 2024, we have received gross proceeds from sales of our common stock pursuant to the ATM totaling an aggregate $3,389,384.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we raised capital of $1,712,564, net of $212,436 in issuance costs, as a result of the sale of 192,500 shares of common stock in connection with pre-IPO private placements.\n\nWe have continued to incur losses from operations. Moreover, we do not believe we have sufficient cash to meet our anticipated operating costs and capital expenditure requirements through the next 12 months, thus we may need to raise additional capital to fund the Company’s growth and future business operations. However, we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges, we may have to delay or reduce the scope of our planned strategic growth initiatives. Moreover, any additional equity financing that we obtain may dilute the ownership held by our existing shareholders. The economic dilution to our shareholders will be significant if our stock price does not materially increase, or if the effective price of any sale is below the price paid by a particular shareholder. Any debt financing could involve substantial restrictions on activities and creditors could seek additional pledges of some or all of our assets. If we fail to obtain additional funding as needed, we may be forced to cease or scale back operations, and our results, financial conditions and stock price would be adversely affected. As such, these factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period.\n\n49  \n---  \n  \n**Contractual Obligations**\n\nMaterial contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of royalty payments to LMM, principal and interest payments for loans made with PayPal, principal and interest payments for operating leases and other purchase obligations. See Notes 6, 10, 12 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2023 for these contractual obligations.\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments, and Use of Estimates**\n\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"US GAAP”). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our most critical estimates include those related to revenue recognition, inventories and reserves for excess and obsolescence, accounting for stock-based awards, and income taxes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our existing critical accounting policies which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Since our inception, except for standard operating leases, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.\n\n**Inflation**\n\nOver the past 18 months, inflation has adversely affected our business, financial condition, and results of operations by increasing our overall cost structure, and such affects will be further exacerbated if we are unable to achieve commensurate increases in the prices, we charge our customers. The existence of inflation in the economy has resulted in, and may continue to result in, higher interest rates and capital costs, shipping costs, supply shortages, increased costs of labor, weakening exchange rates, and other similar effects. As a result of inflation, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, cost increases. In addition, poor economic and market conditions, including a potential recession, may negatively impact market sentiment, decreasing the demand for sportswear and outerwear, which would adversely affect our operating income and results of operations. If we are unable to take effective measures in a timely manner to mitigate the impact of inflation, as well as a potential recession, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n**Climate Change**\n\nOur opinion is that neither climate change, nor governmental regulations related to climate change, have had, or are expected to have, any material effect on our operations.\n\n50  \n---  \n  \n**New Accounting Pronouncements**\n\nThere were certain updates recently issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB”), most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n**BUSINESS**\n\nFounded in October 2018 and headquartered in Florida with remote employees and specialty contractors in London, New York and Latin America, we have built a brand acceleration platform with a focus on the acquisition, optimization and monetization of consumer brands across multiple categories. Our mission is to provide customers with unmatched variety, quality and shopping experience, while adding considerable value for MGO’s shareholders.\n\nOur accomplished leadership team encompasses decades of experience in building successful global lifestyle brands, including fashion design, marketing, technology, corporate finance and branding. We strive to continually push innovation and evolution of the consumer product cycle without compromising quality and design integrity. Through our end-to-end, scalable brand-building platform, backed by robust consumer behavioral data, we are engaged in nurturing digitally native brands that will thrive in the modern Direct to Consumer (\"DTC”) economy.\n\nIn 2018, we signed a global licensing agreement with Leo Messi Management (\"LMM”), soccer legend Lionel Messi’s licensing and management company and created the \"Messi Brand” – a line of casual wear and accessories inspired by his trend-setting style and offered on The Messi Store (www.themessistore.com). Designed by the Company’s co-founder and Chief Brand Officer, Virginia Hilfiger, the Messi Brand’s DNA is rooted in Messi’s personal style and emphasizes accessibility, comfort and ease.\n\nIn March 2024, we assigned our global licensing agreement with LMM (\"LMM License Agreement”) to Centric Brands, LLC (\"Centric”). Centric is a global leading lifestyle brand collective that has expertise in product design, development and sourcing; retail and digital commerce; marketing and brand building. Centric designs, sources, markets, and sells high-quality products in the kid’s, men’s and women’s apparel, accessories, beauty, and entertainment categories. The company’s portfolio includes licenses for more than 100 iconic brands, including Calvin Klein®, Tommy Hilfiger®, Nautica®, Spyder®, and Under Armour® in the kid’s category; Joe’s Jeans®, Buffalo®, Hervé Léger®, and IZOD® in the men’s and women’s apparel category; Coach®, Kate Spade®, Michael Kors®, All Saints®, Frye®, Timberland®, Hunter®, and Jessica Simpson® in the accessories category; and in the entertainment category, Disney®, Marvel®, Nickelodeon®, and Warner Brothers® among many others. The company also owns and operates Zac Posen®, Hudson®, Robert Graham®, Avirex®, Fiorelli®, and Taste Beauty® and operates a joint venture brand, Favorite Daughter, with Sara and Erin Foster. The company’s products are sold through leading mass-market retailers, specialty and department stores, and online. The company is headquartered in New York City, with U.S. offices in Los Angeles and Greensboro, and international offices in Asia, Europe, Montreal, and Toronto. In connection with the assignment of the LMM License Agreement, Centric paid MGO $2,000,000 in cash and assumed the obligation to pay €1,500,000 in aggregate royalty payments due to LMM in 2024.\n\nWhile the _Messi Brand_ was previously the only asset in our portfolio through early 2023, our business model has remained centered on strategic expansion through collaborations, licensing, acquisitions and organic development. As our brand portfolio expands, we intend to drive the commercial value of each brand through our own DTC platform methodologies, ensuring that each brand maintains its own unique identity while remaining thoughtfully aligned with the values of our customers.\n\nIn November 2022, we formed MGO Digital LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary which leverages data analytics, advanced technology-enabled marketing and our leadership team’s industry relationships and expertise to identify, incubate and introduce to market new, authentic brand concepts.\n\nIn March 2023, we obtained a royalty-free, worldwide and exclusive license to the assets of Stand CO, LLC, a DTC digitally native brand which offers a line of high quality, residential flagpoles, American flags, solar flagpole light kits, flagpole finials, patriotic-themed apparel and other products. Stand Flagpoles brought to our brand portfolio immediate revenue generation and the opportunity to further demonstrate the benefits of its end-to-end, data-driven brand-building platform to help accelerate and optimize long-term growth. In late March 2023, the Company formed Americana Liberty, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary focused exclusively on supporting the new DTC flagpole and related product line.\n\n51  \n---  \n  \n**_Our Mission_**\n\nMGO is intent on inspiring people worldwide to express their best, most authentic selves through our distinctive lifestyle and consumer product brands; and delivering superior financial performance and value creation through the optimization of our shared services across our scalable brand-building platform.\n\n**_Our Core Values_**\n\nSince our inception, we have consciously fostered a corporate culture in which our core values are deeply ingrained in our identity and serve as a compass to guide our decision-making and business-building processes. Our core values are the source of our Company’s drive and distinctiveness, thoughtfully woven into our organizational fabric to influence how we think, work and act. These core values are:\n\n● | **Collaboration** : we enthusiastically welcome and apply insight, experience, ideas and perspective gained from each other, our trusted business partners and our customers.  \n---|---  \n● | **Integrity** : we honor our work, which earns trust.  \n● | **Accountability** : we trust our experience and apply common sense when implementing and adhering to financially, socially and environmentally responsible policies and practices that positively impact our stakeholders, the communities where we live and work and the world, at large.  \n● | **Passion:** we demonstrate pride in our brands, in the quality of our products and in each other through our words and actions.  \n● | **Diversity and Inclusion** : we embrace and celebrate individual uniqueness and respect diversity of views, ideas and cultures.  \n  \n**_Stand Flagpoles/Americana Liberty, LLC_**\n\nThrough our wholly owned subsidiary Americana Liberty, LLC, we operate _www.standflagpoles.com_ , a DTC ecommerce store offering a thoughtfully curated line of premium outdoor flagpoles for residential and commercial use and other related accessories marketed under the brand _Stand Flagpoles_.\n\nOur core product line is anchored by the _Roosevelt Premium 25ft Telescoping Flagpole Kit_ , featuring a solid, strong and durable 3” diameter telescoping pole made from black 14 gauge aircraft aluminum that has been designed to withstand category one hurricane wind speeds. The hard outer shell of the pole, equipped with an advanced rope and pulley system, has been subjected to an anodization process to protect the metal from wear and tear and rusting. The flagpole system uses metal pins to lock sections in place and a pinching sleeve to keep the telescoping sections sturdy. Included in each kit sold is a 4’X6’ premium embroidered American flag, interchangeable premium aluminum gold finial ball, customer lifetime warranty and free shipping. The Roosevelt can also accommodate a solar lighting mount in lieu of the finial.\n\nOther products offered under the _Stand Flagpole_ brand include:\n\n● | Standard telescoping flagpole kit comes with a 16 gauge rustproof aluminum flagpole (20ft or 25ft) capable of flying two flags, rope and pulley system, 3’X5’ American flag, gold ball finial and clips and a ground sleeve.   \n---|---  \n● | High performance U.S. (3’x5’, 4’x6’ and 5’x8’); state (3’x5’) and military (3’x5’) flags with brass grommets  \n● | Selection of gold eagle finial or replacement gold ball finial  \n● | Hardware replacements and parts  \n● | Gift cards  \n  \n52  \n---  \n  \n_Stand Flagpole_ products are sold directly to consumers exclusively through our ecommerce store, found at _www.standflagpoles.com_.\n\nMarketing Strategy for _Stand Flagpoles_\n\nWe utilize primarily digital marketing to broadcast, amplify and showcase our _Stand Flagpole_ product line, leaning heavily into outbound email and digital mobile marketing, as well as social media marketing. Our marketing approach features core messaging focused on featured flash sales, patriotic holiday promotions (namely, President’s Day, Veteran’s Day, Memorial Day and Independence Day) and direct appeals to U.S. military families and supporters and patriotic Americans, in general. Given that 2024 is a national election year, marketing efforts have expanded to include proactive digital outreach to supporters of the national and state Republican and Democratic parties.\n\n**_Social Media Marketing_**\n\nWe use social media, including Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, as well as email, SMS and direct mail as part of our multi-channel approach to marketing our _Stand Flagpole_ line of products, and we encourage our customers to use social media while shopping.\n\n**_Supply Chain Strategy_**\n\nBased on our leadership’s experience in building global consumer product brands for many of the world’s leading companies, we have established, long-standing relationships and key industry knowledge that empowers us to best identify and leverage qualified third-party suppliers and manufacturers to produce our raw materials and finished products.\n\nFor the _Stand Flagpole_ brand, we curate our flagpoles and flagpole accessories from qualified engineering firms and manufacturers based on our stringent, high quality standards for raw materials, design and durability factors and aesthetics.\n\nWe do not own any manufacturing facilities and do not manufacture any of our products. We purchase our finished products from third-party manufacturers on a purchase-order basis and do not have any agreements requiring us to use any specific supplier or manufacturer. We have long-standing relationships with our vendors, built over decades by key members of our team. Chosen based on desired design and production specifications of a particular product or collection, our global network of valued manufacturers are based in Brazil, China, India, Latvia, Mexico, Peru, Portugal, Sri Lanka and the United States. We regularly source new suppliers and manufacturers across the world to support our ongoing innovation and growth, and we carefully evaluate all new suppliers and manufacturers to ensure they share our high standards for quality and precision in manufacturing, ethical working conditions and social and environmental sustainability practices.\n\n**_Warehousing and Logistics_**\n\nMGO manages its ecommerce order fulfillment and inventory warehousing support platform through its partnership with U.S.-based Fulfillment Strategies International (\"FSI”). Headquartered just west of Atlanta, Georgia, FSI has been providing its customers – ranging from entrepreneurs to Fortune 500 companies – with scalable inventory management, order fulfillment, subscription box management and kitting and assembly services for nearly 30 years. The Company is leveraging FSI’s warehousing and logistical capabilities to capitalize on prevailing operational and cost efficiencies made possible with the addition of a U.S.-based 3PL provider with deep expertise in digital commerce. Currently, FSI provides MGO with comprehensive 3PL services in support of _Stand Flagpoles_ products sold to customers within the United States.\n\nWe regularly evaluate our distribution infrastructure and capacity to ensure that we remain positioned to timely and efficiently meet our anticipated needs and support continued growth of our brands.\n\n53  \n---  \n  \n**Market Opportunities**\n\n**_Total Addressable Market – Flagpoles_**\n\nIndustry research firm DataIntelo reports that the global flagpole market was $104 million in 2023 and will exceed $274 million by 2024, expanding at a CAGR of 13.99% during 2024-2023. DataIntelo further noted that key drivers of the anticipated growth are rising real estate development, growing tourism industry and growing nationalism and patriotism. (Source: DataIntelo, _Flagpole Market Outlook 2032_ , January 1, 2024.)\n\nVOA reported on January 16, 2024 that \"2024 will go down as one of the most politically consequential years in history, with national elections in more than 60 countries representing half of the world’s population.” 2024 is an election year in the United States and sales of American and state flags, and the flagpoles needed to fly them, are expected to be robust, serving as a source of pride and unity for Americans and embodying the ideals of liberty, justice, freedom, love of country and national purpose.\n\n**_E-Commerce Market Outlook_**\n\nGrand View Research stated in its report, titled _B2C Ecommerce Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report by Product Category, By Region and Segment Forecasts, 2024-2030_, that the global B2C ecommerce market size was valued at $5.47 trillion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 19.1% from 2024 to 2030 to reach $17.77 trillion. Grand View notes, \"With the proliferation of technologies, the incorporation of artificial intelligence, machine learning, augmented reality and virtual reality into B2C ecommerce platforms improves the shopping experience by providing interactive product graphical representation, virtual try-ons and customized recommendations, allowing businesses to differentiate themselves and attract customers. Market globalization has created new opportunities for firms to expand their reach beyond domestic borders, tap into foreign markets, and cater to a shifted consumer base, propelling growth in the market. Due to the competitive nature of the business-to-consumer ecommerce sector, firms are compelled to innovate and differentiate themselves through distinct value propositions, creative products, customer-focused strategies, and improved shopping experiences.\n\n**_Retail Landscape Realities_**\n\nLifestyle brands, whether accessible or prestige, have faced structural shifts in the retail landscape that have made it more challenging for them to succeed. Those challenges include:\n\n● | **_Decline of Traditional Wholesale Channels:_** It is estimated by analysts at UBS that between 40,000 to 50,000 retail stores in the United States will close down over the next five years. UBS sees the most closures shaking out among clothing and accessories retailers, consumer electronics businesses and home furnishing chains, or about 23,500 stores cumulatively within these categories by 2026. (Source: CNBC, UBS Expects 50,000 Store Closures in the U.S. Over the Next 5 Years After Pandemic Pause, April 13, 2022)  \n---|---  \n● | **_Direct-to-Consumer, or DTC, as an Essential Channel for Every Brand:_** Given the growth in online and the challenges associated with traditional wholesale channels, brands are increasingly seeking DTC channels but often lack the financial or human capital to build them.  \n● | **_Larger, More Fractured Discovery Landscape:_** According to Publicis Sapient, 87% of shoppers today begin product searches online, meaning that younger customers are focused on direct search for brands they already know (Source: Publicis Sapient, \"_Shopper-First Retailing – The New Rules of Retail from the Actions, Voices and Eyes of Today’s Consumers_ ”, 2018).  \n● | **_Growing Importance of Data_** : We believe that data and data analytics is critical to helping brands assess their product and efficiently acquire customers and improve customer experience. Through traditional wholesale channels, brands receive very minimal data, and the data they do receive is often a season old.  \n  \n**Competitive Landscape**\n\nCompetition in the global consumer products industry is principally based on product quality, innovation, style, price, brand image, distribution model and definitive standards for customer experience and service. Generally speaking, our industry is intensely competitive, and many companies who may be perceived as our competitors have substantially greater financial, distribution and marketing resources, as well as greater brand awareness.\n\nCompetition within the U.S. flagpole and flagpole accessory market is comprised mainly of small specialty outdoor retailers, many of which have adopted direct-to-consumer ecommerce models to market their products to active and veteran miliary families, patriotic Americans, schools/universities and U.S., state and local government agencies. Among them are Liberty Flagpoles, United States Flag Store, American Flagpole & Flag Co. and Uncommon US. Large home and outdoor retailers, such as Home Depot and Lowes, also offer flagpole products.\n\n54  \n---  \n  \n**_Our Competitive Strengths_**\n\nWe believe that MGO Global stands to benefit from a number of competitive differentiators that serve to set our Company apart from other lifestyle brand portfolio companies. Chief among them are:\n\n● | **Proven, Premium Lifestyle Brand Builders Lead MGO.** Our Company’s design and production team is led by 30-year industry veteran Ginny Hilfiger, younger sibling of Tommy Hilfiger, a globally renowned pioneer of classic American cool style. During her 15-year tenure as EVP of Design at Tommy Hilfiger’s namesake apparel brand, Ginny was the visionary behind Tommy Jeans, the women’s sportswear and junior lines, the H Hilfiger collection for Federated Department Stores and the successful brand collaboration between Tommy and supermodel Gigi Hadid – just to name a few key achievements. Following her run of successes at Tommy, she launched her own signature brand \"Ginny H” before being recruited as Creative Director for FILA Global, charged with revamping FILA’s brand DNA globally. MGO’s C-suite also includes Julian Groves, Chief Operating Officer, who brings our Company over 25 years of experience in global brand strategy and expansion for lifestyle brands that have included J. Brand, True Religion, Guess and Burberry; and Chief Executive Officer, Maximiliano Ojeda, an international business executive and entrepreneur who, along with Ginny Hilfiger, co-founded MGO and today guides and directs our global business operations and brand-building architecture.  \n---|---  \n● | **Established Relationships with Many of the World’s Leading Consumer Product Manufacturers.** Through our team’s collective experience and sphere of influence in the global consumer product industry, we have knowledge of and direct relationships with many of the world’s best manufacturers of premium materials and finished goods. Chosen based on desired design and production specifications of a particular product or collection, our global network of valued manufacturers span the world with operations in Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Latvia, Mexico, Peru, Portugal, Sri Lanka and the United States.  \n● | **Deep Connections with Our Loyal and Passionate Customers.** Younger generations are embracing social media platforms and mobile apps, in particular, as a means for community building and discovery. This seamless exchange of community-based inspiration encourages like-minded consumers to purchase products that allow for unapologetic self-expression that reflects their passions and values.   \n● | **Data Driven, Low-Risk Merchandizing and Smarter Marketing Models.** We employ a data-driven approach to design, merchandizing and inventory planning and allocation to ensure we deliver products that meet and exceed our customers’ high expectations for quality, precision and style. We have excellent visibility into our customers’ preferences through their purchasing history and direct feedback, which we leverage to inform our purchasing decisions. Through our vertical sourcing model and global network of manufacturers, coupled with our in-house IT and marketing teams, we have the flexibility to respond quickly to prevailing sales trends and make adjustments to our current offerings, if or whenever necessary. We utilize a read and react testing approach with shallow initial buys and data-driven repurchasing decisions to iterate our new product offerings, thereby minimizing our inventory risks and optimizing our gross profit margins on sales. Further, we employ multiple digital marketing tools and machine learning technologies to identify new customers and markets, capture key customer insights, uncover hidden patterns and accelerate our creative marketing processes to achieve higher traffic volume to our ecommerce store(s), higher conversion rates and higher customer lifetime value.  \n  \n**Our Growth Strategies**\n\nThe key elements of our growth strategy are centered on:\n\n● | **Driving Leverage in Operational Efficiency**. We are focused on using our customer and market data to drive actionable insights and improve key aspects of our brand management platform’s operations. Moreover, we plan to further deepen customer relationships with personalization and customization through the development and launch of a customer loyalty program. Through this program, we expect to tailor our marketing messages, promotions and product recommendations to each unique customer’s preferences with a goal of enhancing customer engagement and capturing greater spend.  \n---|---  \n  \n55  \n---  \n  \n● | **Implement New Technologies.** We will continue to enhance our ecommerce functionality with tools for product recommendations, enhanced payment options (e.g., buy now pay later), and improved returns processes to drive conversions and increase order value. We also believe there is an opportunity to further leverage our proprietary artificial intelligence-powered and algorithm-driven DTC marketing system to drive more efficient customer acquisition, conversion and retention marketing strategies.   \n---|---  \n● | **Growing through Strategic Acquisitions and Brand Partnerships and Collaborations.** Capitalizing on the platform infrastructure we created to support the development, launch and success of _The Messi Brand_ and _Stand Flagpoles_ , we will actively look to identify and pursue new opportunities to incubate and vertically integrate other brand and brand concepts into our brand portfolio, replicating and scaling our licensing model. In addition, we aim to explore incremental growth opportunities to acquire existing lifestyle brands, products or intellectual property that will complement our brand mix and appeal to our customers. Finally, it is common practice in the consumer products industry to establish brand collaborations with other leading lifestyle brands to penetrate new product categories, enter new markets and expand into new geographic regions. In this regard, we expect to seek out opportunities to identify and pursue brand collaborations with premium lifestyle brands with the goal of leveraging and cross-marketing new co-branded products to existing and prospective customer bases of our brands to fuel our respective revenue growth.  \n  \n**Intellectual Property**\n\n**_Stand Flagpoles License_**\n\nOn March 13, 2023, MGO obtained a royalty free, worldwide and exclusive license to the use of certain assets of Stand Co., LLC (\"Stand”) for all purposes in exchange for payment of $1.00 by the Company. The license is in perpetuity.\n\nOn May 11, 2023, we executed a 12-month consulting agreement with Jason Harward (\"Consultant”), the owner of Stand and nephew of Matt Harward, MGO’s former Chief Marketing Officer. The consulting agreement compensation terms were $350,000 payable in two installments, the first installment was paid in September 2023 and second installment was paid in January 2024. The compensation terms included 15,000 restricted stock units awarded on January 31, 2024 which vest over the remaining life of the consulting agreement, which ended May 2024.\n\nLicensed assets include all rights to all stock keeping units (\"SKU”) of Stand sold under the names: \"Roosevelt Premium 25ft Telescoping Flag Pole Kit,” \"20FT Telescoping Flag Pole Kit” and \"LED Solar Flag Pole Light;” any intellectual property and other intangible property related to SKUs, including but not limited to all rights to a brand name \"Stand Flagpoles,” domain and website standflagpoles.com, the Meta pages associated with \"Stand Flagpoles” brand name (in Facebook and Instagram); all manufacturer, distributor and customer contracts and relationships for SKUs; marketing materials; any commercialization rights; domain and administrative access to Stand’s Shopify account, Facebook Assets & Accounts; all historical digital and non-digital assets; and customer database since inception.\n\n**_Other Intellectual Property_**\n\nThis Registration Statement on Form S-1 may also contain trademarks, service marks and trade names of third parties, which are the property of their respective owners. Our use or display of third parties’ trademarks, service marks and trade names or products in this Registration Statement is not intended to, and does not imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship by us. Solely for convenience, the trademarks, service marks and trade names referred to in this Registration Statement may appear without the ®, TM or SM symbols, but the omission of such references is not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or the right of the applicable owner of these trademarks, service marks and trade names.\n\n**Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters**\n\nOur business is subject to a number of laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations include federal and state consumer protection laws protecting the privacy of consumer information and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. In particular, under federal and state privacy laws and regulations, we must provide notice to consumers of our policies on sharing sensitive information with third parties, advance notice of any changes to our policies and, in some instances, we may be obligated to give customers the right to prevent sharing of their sensitive information with unaffiliated third parties. The growth and demand for e-commerce could result in more stringent consumer protection laws that impose additional compliance burdens on online companies. These consumer protection laws could result in substantial compliance costs.\n\n56  \n---  \n  \nIn many jurisdictions, there is currently great uncertainty whether or how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. In addition, new tax regulations in jurisdictions where we do not now collect state and local taxes may subject us to the obligation to collect and remit state and local taxes or subject us to additional state and local sales and income taxes, or to requirements intended to assist states with their tax collection efforts. New legislation or regulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and e-commerce could result in significant additional taxes on our business. These taxes or tax collection obligations could have an adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations. Further, there is a possibility that we may be subject to significant fines or other payments for any past failures to comply with these requirements.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations that could affect our business, including those promulgated under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the Textile Fiber Product Identification Act, the rules and regulations of the Consumer Products Safety Commission and various environmental laws and regulations. Our operations also are subject to various international trade agreements and regulations. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental regulations, current governmental regulations may change or become more stringent or unforeseen events may occur, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\n\n**Our Headquarters**\n\nOur principal corporate address is 1515 SE 17th Street, Suite 121/#460596, Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33346 and our telephone number is 347-913-3316. Our corporate website address is www.mgoglobalinc.com and the ecommerce store for _The Messi Brand_ can be found online at www.themessistore.com and the ecommerce store for _Stand Flagpoles_ can be found online at www.standflagpoles.com. The information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our websites is not a part of this Registration Statement on Form S-1. We have included our website address in this S-1 solely as an inactive textual reference.\n\n**Employees**\n\nAs of November 27, 2024, we had 4 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees. We also utilize 11 domestic and foreign independent contractors to supplement our workforce.

Our Board recognizes that it is neither possible nor prudent to eliminate all risk. Indeed, purposeful and appropriate risk-taking is essential for our Company to be competitive on a global basis and to achieve its objectives.\n\n**Board of Directors**\n\nOur business and affairs are managed under the direction of our Board. Our Board consists of seven directors, four of whom qualify as \"independent” under the listing standards of Nasdaq.\n\nDirectors serve until the next annual meeting and until their successors are elected and qualified. Officers are appointed to serve until their successors have been elected and qualified.\n\n**Director Independence**\n\nOur Board is composed of a majority of \"independent directors” as defined under the rules of Nasdaq. We use the definition of \"independence” applied by Nasdaq to make this determination. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that an \"independent director” is a person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the company’s board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Nasdaq listing rules provide that a director cannot be considered independent if:\n\n● | the director is, or at any time during the past three (3) years was, an employee of the company;  \n---|---  \n● | the director or a family member of the director accepted any compensation from the company in excess of $120,000 during any period of twelve (12) consecutive months within the three (3) years preceding the independence determination (subject to certain exemptions, including, among other things, compensation for board or board committee service);  \n● | the director or a family member of the director is a partner in, controlling shareholder of, or an executive officer of an entity to which the company made, or from which the company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed 5% of the recipient’s gross revenue for that year or $200,000, whichever is greater (subject to certain exemptions);  \n● | the director or a family member of the director is employed as an executive officer of an entity where, at any time during the past three (3) years, any of the executive officers of the company served on the compensation committee of such other entity; or  \n● | the director or a family member of the director is a current partner of the company’s outside auditor, or at any time during the past three (3) years was a partner or employee of the company’s outside auditor, and who worked on the company’s audit.  \n  \nUnder such definitions, our Board has undertaken a review of the independence of each director. Based on the information provided by each director concerning his or her background, employment and affiliations, our Board has determined that four of our directors are independent directors of the Company.\n\n61  \n---  \n  \n**Committees of the Board**\n\nCommittees of the Board were established and took effect upon our Common Stock being listed on Nasdaq on January 13, 2023.

The Nasdaq listing standards define \"financially literate” as being able to read and understand fundamental financial statements, including a company’s balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement.\n\n62  \n---  \n  \nIn addition, the Company has, and will continue to have, at least one member who has past employment experience in finance or accounting, requisite professional certification in accounting, or other comparable experience or background that results in the individual’s financial sophistication.\n\n**_Compensation Committee_**\n\nOur Compensation Committee consists of three independent directors.

Such Code addresses, among other things, honesty and ethical conduct, conflicts of interest, compliance with laws, regulations and policies, including disclosure requirements under the federal securities laws, and reporting of violations of the Code.

Under the Clawback Policy, in the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, the Board will require reimbursement or forfeiture of any excess Incentive Compensation received by any covered executive during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement. Incentive Compensation is defined as a compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part on the attainment of a financial reporting measure.\n\n**Insider Trading Policy**\n\nIn July 2023, we adopted an insider trading policy governing the purchase, sale, and/or other dispositions of our securities by our directors, officers, and employees, to promote compliance with insider trading laws, rules and regulations, and applicable Nasdaq listing standards applicable to us. Our insider trading policy, among other things, prohibits our directors, officers, and employees from holding our securities in a margin account or pledging our securities as collateral for a loan.

The 2022 Plan governs equity awards to our employees, directors, officers, consultants and other eligible participants. Initially, the maximum number of shares of our Common Stock that may be subject to awards under the 2022 Plan is 218,647. The maximum number of shares that are subject to awards under the 2022 Plan is subject to an annual increase equal to the lesser of (i) 50,000 shares of our Common Stock; (ii) a number of shares of our Common Stock equal to 4% of the prior year’s maximum number or (iii) such number of shares of our Common Stock as determined by the 2022 Plan administrator. The 2022 Plan was made effective on January 11, 2023.\n\nThe purpose of 2022 Plan is to attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of substantial responsibility, to provide additional incentive to employees, directors and consultants, and to promote the success of our business. The administrator of the 2022 Plan may, in its sole discretion, amend, alter, suspend or terminate the 2022 Plan, or any part thereof, at any time and for any reason. We will obtain stockholder approval of any 2022 Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the administration of equity-based awards. The 2022 Plan automatically will terminate on August 15, 2032, unless it is terminated sooner.\n\n**_Authorized Shares_**\n\nInitially, the maximum number of shares of our Common Stock that may be subject to awards under the 2022 Plan is 218,647. The maximum number of shares that are subject to awards under the 2022 Plan is subject to an annual increase equal to the lesser of (i) 50,000 shares of our Common Stock; (ii) a number of shares of our Common Stock equal to 4% of the prior year’s maximum number or (iii) such number of shares of our Common Stock as determined by the 2022 Plan administrator.\n\n68  \n---  \n  \nAdditionally, if any award issued pursuant to the 2022 Plan expires or becomes unexercisable without having been exercised in full, is surrendered pursuant to an exchange program, as provided in the 2022 Plan, or, with respect to restricted stock, restricted stock units (\"RSUs”), performance units or performance shares, is forfeited to or repurchased by us due to the failure to vest, the unpurchased shares (or for awards other than stock options or stock appreciation rights the forfeited or repurchased shares) which were subject thereto will become available for future grant or sale under the 2022 Plan (unless the 2022 Plan has terminated). With respect to stock appreciation rights, only shares actually issued pursuant to a stock appreciation right will cease to be available under the 2022 Plan; all remaining shares under stock appreciation rights will remain available for future grant or sale under the 2022 Plan (unless the 2022 Plan has terminated). Shares that have actually been issued under the 2022 Plan under any award will not be returned to the 2022 Plan and will not become available for future distribution under the 2022 Plan; provided, however, that if shares issued pursuant to awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares or performance units are repurchased by the Company or are forfeited to the Company due to the failure to vest, such shares will become available for future grant under the 2022 Plan. Shares used to pay the exercise price of an award or to satisfy the tax withholdings related to an award will become available for future grant or sale under the 2022 Plan. To the extent an award under the 2022 Plan is paid out in cash rather than shares, such cash payment will not result in reducing the number of shares available for issuance under the 2022 Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing and, subject to adjustment as provided in the 2022 Plan, the maximum number of shares that may be issued upon the exercise of incentive stock options will equal the aggregate share number stated above, plus, to the extent allowable under Section 422 of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder, any shares that become available for issuance under the 2022 Plan in accordance with the foregoing.\n\nOn April 12, 2024, the Board unanimously authorized and approved an amendment (\"Plan Amendment”) to MGO’s 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2022 Plan”) to increase the number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock, par value $0.00001 per share, (\"Common Stock”) reserved for issuance under the 2022 Plan by an additional 182,541 shares of Common Stock. Such increase resulted in a total of 451,188 shares of Common Stock being reserved under the 2022 Plan. On April 17, 2024 (the \"Record Date”), a majority of our stockholders consented to the Plan Amendment.\n\nAs of November 27, 2024, all shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 2022 Plan have been issued, leaving zero shares available for future issuance.\n\n**_Plan Administration_**\n\nOne or more committees appointed by our Board will administer the 2022 Plan. Initially, the Compensation Committee shall administer the 2022 Plan. In addition, if we determine it is desirable to qualify transactions under the 2022 Plan as exempt under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act, such transactions will be structured with the intent that they satisfy the requirements for exemption under Rule 16b-3. Subject to the provisions of the 2022 Plan, the administrator has the power to administer the 2022 Plan and make all determinations deemed necessary or advisable for administering the 2022 Plan, including the power to determine the fair market value of our Common Stock, select the service providers to whom awards may be granted, determine the number of shares covered by each award, approve forms of award agreements for use under the 2022 Plan, determine the terms and conditions of awards (including the exercise price, the time or times at which the awards may be exercised, any vesting acceleration or waiver or forfeiture restrictions and any restriction or limitation regarding any award or the shares relating thereto), construe and interpret the terms of the 2022 Plan and awards granted under it, prescribe, amend and rescind rules relating to the 2022 Plan, rules and regulations relating to sub-plans established for the purpose of facilitating compliance with applicable non-U.S. laws, easing the administration of the 2022 Plan and/or for qualifying for favorable tax treatment under applicable non-U.S. laws, in each case as the administrator may deem necessary or advisable and modify or amend each award (subject to the provisions of the 2022 Plan), including the discretionary authority to extend the post-termination exercisability period of awards and to extend the maximum term of an option or stock appreciation right (subject to the provisions of the 2022 Plan), to allow participants to satisfy withholding tax obligations in a manner permissible under the 2022 Plan, to authorize any person to execute on behalf of us any instrument required to effect the grant of an award previously granted by the administrator and to allow a participant to defer the receipt of payment of cash or the delivery of shares that would otherwise be due to such participant under an award. The administrator also has the authority to allow participants the opportunity to transfer outstanding awards to a financial institution or other person or entity selected by the administrator and to institute an exchange program by which outstanding awards may be surrendered or cancelled in exchange for awards of the same type which may have a higher or lower exercise price or different terms, awards of a different type or cash, or by which the exercise price of an outstanding award is increased or reduced. The administrator’s decisions, interpretations and other actions are final and binding on all participants.\n\n69  \n---  \n  \n**_Eligibility_**\n\nAwards under the 2022 Plan, other than incentive stock options, may be granted to employees (including officers and directors) of the Company or a parent or subsidiary, members of our Board, or consultants engaged to render bona fide services to the Company or a parent or subsidiary. Incentive stock options may be granted only to our employees of the Company or a subsidiary, provided the services (i) are not in connection with the offer or sale of securities in a capital-raising transaction, and (ii) do not directly promote or maintain a market for our securities, in each case, within the meaning of Form S-8 promulgated under the Securities Act, and provided further, that a consultant will include only those persons to whom the issuance of Shares may be registered under Form S-8 promulgated under the Securities Act.\n\n**_Stock Options_**\n\nStock options may be granted under the 2022 Plan. The exercise price of options granted under the 2022 Plan generally must at least be equal to the fair market value of our Common Stock on the date of grant. The term of each option will be as stated in the applicable award agreement; provided, however, that the term may be no more than 10 years from the date of grant. The administrator will determine the methods of payment of the exercise price of an option, which may include cash, shares or other property acceptable to the administrator, as well as other types of consideration permitted by applicable law. After the termination of service of an employee, director or consultant, they may exercise their option for the period of time stated in their option agreement. In the absence of a specified time in an award agreement, if termination is due to death or disability, the option will remain exercisable for nine months. In all other cases, in the absence of a specified time in an award agreement, the option will remain exercisable for three months following the termination of service. An option may not be exercised later than the expiration of its term. Subject to the provisions of the 2022 Plan, the administrator determines the other terms of options.\n\n**_Stock Appreciation Rights_**\n\nStock appreciation rights may be granted under the 2022 Plan. Stock appreciation rights allow the recipient to receive the appreciation in the fair market value of our Common Stock between the exercise date and the date of grant. Stock appreciation rights may not have a term exceeding 10 years. After the termination of service of an employee, director or consultant, they may exercise their stock appreciation right for the period of time stated in their stock appreciation right agreement. In the absence of a specified time in an award agreement, if termination is due to death or disability, the stock appreciation rights will remain exercisable for nine months. In all other cases, in the absence of a specified time in an award agreement, the stock appreciation rights will remain exercisable for three months following the termination of service. However, in no event may a stock appreciation right be exercised later than the expiration of its term. Subject to the provisions of the 2022 Plan, the administrator determines the other terms of stock appreciation rights, including when such rights become exercisable and whether to pay any increased appreciation in cash or with shares of our Common Stock, or a combination thereof, except that the per share exercise price for the shares to be issued pursuant to the exercise of a stock appreciation right will be no less than 100% of the fair market value per share on the date of grant.\n\n**_Restricted Stock_**\n\nRestricted stock may be granted under the 2022 Plan. Restricted stock awards are grants of shares of our Common Stock that vest in accordance with terms and conditions established by the administrator. The administrator will determine the number of shares of restricted stock granted to any employee, director or consultant and, subject to the provisions of the 2022 Plan, will determine the terms and conditions of such awards. The administrator may impose whatever conditions to vesting it determines to be appropriate (for example, the administrator may set restrictions based on the achievement of specific performance goals or continued service to us); provided, however, that the administrator, in its sole discretion, may accelerate the time at which any restrictions will lapse or be removed. Recipients of restricted stock awards generally will have voting and dividend rights with respect to such shares upon grant without regard to vesting, unless the administrator provides otherwise. Shares of restricted stock that do not vest are subject to the Company’s right of repurchase or forfeiture.\n\n**_Restricted Stock Units_**\n\nRSUs may be granted under the 2022 Plan. RSUs are bookkeeping entries representing an amount equal to the fair market value of one share of our Common Stock. Subject to the provisions of the 2022 Plan, the administrator determines the terms and conditions of RSUs, including the vesting criteria and the form and timing of payment. The administrator may set vesting criteria based upon the achievement of Company-wide, divisional, business unit or individual goals (including continued employment or service), applicable federal or state securities laws or any other basis determined by the administrator in its discretion. The administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned RSUs in the form of cash, in shares of our Common Stock or in some combination thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the administrator, in its sole discretion, may accelerate the time at which any vesting requirements will be deemed satisfied.\n\n70  \n---  \n  \n**_Performance Awards_**\n\nPerformance awards may be granted under the 2022 Plan. Performance awards are awards that will result in a payment to a participant only if performance goals established by the administrator are achieved or the awards otherwise vest. The administrator will set objectives or vesting provisions, that, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the value the payout for the performance awards. The administrator may set vesting criteria based on the achievement of company-wide, divisional, business unit, or individual goals (including, but not limited to, continued employment or service), or any other basis determined by the administrator in its discretion. Each performance award’s threshold, target, and maximum payout values are established by the administrator on or before the grant date. After the grant of a performance award, the administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any performance objectives or other vesting provisions for such performance award. The administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned performance awards in the form of cash, in shares, or in some combination thereof.\n\n**_Non-Employee Directors_**\n\nThe 2022 Plan provides that all non-employee directors will be eligible to receive all types of awards (except for incentive stock options) under the 2022 Plan. The 2022 Plan includes a maximum limit of $100,000 of equity awards that may be granted to a non-employee director in any fiscal year, increased to $200,000 in connection with his or her initial service. For purposes of this limitation, the value of equity awards is based on the grant date fair value (determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States). Any equity awards granted to a person for their services as an employee, or for their services as a consultant (other than as a non-employee director), will not count for purposes of the limitation. The maximum limit does not reflect the intended size of any potential compensation or equity awards to our non-employee directors.\n\n**_Non-transferability of Awards_**\n\nUnless the administrator provides otherwise, the 2022 Plan generally does not allow for the transfer of awards other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and only the recipient of an award may exercise an award during their lifetime. If the administrator makes an award transferrable, such award will contain such additional terms and conditions as the administrator deems appropriate.\n\n**_Certain Adjustments_**\n\nIn the event of certain changes in our capitalization, to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits available under the 2022 Plan, the administrator will adjust the number and class of shares that may be delivered under the 2022 Plan or the number, and price of shares covered by each outstanding award and the numerical share limits set forth in the 2022 Plan.\n\n**_Dissolution or Liquidation_**\n\nIn the event of our proposed liquidation or dissolution, the administrator will notify participants as soon as practicable and all awards will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed transaction.\n\n71  \n---  \n  \n**_Merger or Change in Control_**\n\nThe 2022 Plan provides that in the event of our merger with or into another corporation or entity or a \"change in control” (as defined in the 2022 Plan), each outstanding award will be treated as the administrator determines, including, without limitation, that (i) awards will be assumed, or substantially equivalent awards will be substituted, by the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof) with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and prices; (ii) upon written notice to a participant, that the participant’s awards will terminate upon or immediately prior to the consummation of such merger or change in control; (iii) outstanding awards will vest and become exercisable, realizable or payable, or restrictions applicable to an award will lapse, in whole or in part, prior to or upon consummation of such merger or change in control and, to the extent the administrator determines, terminate upon or immediately prior to the effectiveness of such merger or change in control; (iv) (A) the termination of an award in exchange for an amount of cash or property, if any, equal to the amount that would have been attained upon the exercise of such award or realization of the participant’s rights as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction the administrator determines in good faith that no amount would have been attained upon the exercise of such award or realization of the participant’s rights, then such award may be terminated by us without payment) or (B) the replacement of such award with other rights or property selected by the administrator in its sole discretion; or (v) any combination of the foregoing. The administrator will not be obligated to treat all awards, all awards a participant holds, or all awards of the same type, similarly. In the event that awards (or portion thereof) are not assumed or substituted for in the event of a merger or change in control, the participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise all of their outstanding options and stock appreciation rights, including shares as to which such awards would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on restricted stock and RSUs or performance awards will lapse and, with respect to awards with performance-based vesting, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at 100% of target levels and all other terms and conditions met, in all cases, unless specifically provided otherwise under the applicable award agreement or other written agreement between the participant and us or any of our subsidiaries or parents, as applicable. If an option or stock appreciation right is not assumed or substituted in the event of a merger or change in control, the administrator will notify the participant in writing or electronically that the option or stock appreciation right will be exercisable for a period of time determined by the administrator in its sole discretion and the vested option or stock appreciation right will terminate upon the expiration of such period.\n\nFor awards granted to an outside director, the outside director will fully vest in and have the right to exercise options and/or stock appreciation rights as to all of the shares underlying such award, including those shares which would not be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on restricted stock and RSUs will lapse, and, with respect to awards with performance-based vesting, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at one hundred percent (100%) of target levels and all other terms and conditions met, unless specifically provided otherwise under the applicable award agreement or other written agreement between the participant and us or any of our subsidiaries or parents, as applicable.\n\n**_Clawback_**\n\nAwards will be subject to any Company clawback policy that we are required to adopt pursuant to the listing standards of Nasdaq or any other national securities exchange or association on which our securities are listed or as is otherwise required by the Dodd-Frank Act or other applicable laws. The administrator also may specify in an award agreement that the participant’s rights, payments or benefits with respect to an award will be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events. The administrator may require a participant to forfeit, return or reimburse us all or a portion of the award or shares issued under the award, any amounts paid under the award and any payments or proceeds paid or provided upon disposition of the shares issued under the award in order to comply with such clawback policy or applicable laws.\n\n**_Amendment and Termination_**\n\nThe administrator has the authority to amend, suspend or terminate the 2022 Plan provided such action does not impair the existing rights of any participant. The 2022 Plan automatically will terminate on August 15, 2032, unless it is terminated sooner.\n\n**Equity Compensation Plan Information**\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, there have been no grants made under the 2022 Plan.\n\n**PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS**\n\nThe following table sets forth certain information, as of November 27, 2024 with respect to the holdings of (1) each person who is the beneficial owner of more than 5% of Company voting stock, (2) each of our directors, (3) each executive officer, and (4) all of our current directors and executive officers as a group.\n\nBeneficial ownership of the voting stock is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and includes any shares of company voting stock over which a person exercises sole or shared voting or investment power, or of which a person has a right to acquire ownership at any time within 60 days of November 27, 2024.

Because this is a summary description, it does not contain all of the information that may be important to you. For a more detailed description of our capital stock, you should refer to the applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \"DGCL”), our Certificate of Incorporation, or Charter, and our Bylaws as currently in effect. Copies of our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws are included as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part._\n\n**General**\n\nWe are authorized to issue 170,000,000 shares of capital stock, 150,000,000 shares of which are Common Stock, and 20,000,000 shares of which are preferred stock, par $0.00001 per share. As of November 27, 2024, there were 28 holders of record of our Common Stock.\n\n**Common Stock**\n\nThe holders of our Common Stock are entitled to the following rights:\n\n**_Voting Rights_**. Each share of our Common Stock entitles its holder to one vote per share on all matters to be voted or consented upon by the stockholders.\n\n**_Dividend Rights_**. Subject to limitations under the DGCL, holders of our Common Stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends or other distributions, if any, as may be declared by our Board out of funds legally available therefor.\n\n**_Liquidation Rights_**. In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our business, the holders of our Common Stock are entitled to share ratably in the assets available for distribution after the payment of all of our debts and other liabilities.\n\n**_Other Matters_**. The holders of our Common Stock that are not to be issued upon conversion of the convertible promissory notes have no subscription, redemption or conversion privileges; in addition, such Common Stock does not entitle its holders to preemptive rights. All of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock are fully paid and non-assessable.\n\n74  \n---  \n  \n**Preferred Stock**\n\nAs of November 27, 2024, we have not issued any shares of preferred stock. However, our Board has the authority to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more classes or series and to fix the designations, powers, preferences, and rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof including dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any class or series, without further vote or action by the stockholders.\n\nWhile we do not currently have any plans for the issuance of any shares of preferred stock, the issuance of shares of preferred stock could adversely affect the rights of the holders of Common Stock and, therefore, reduce the value of the Common Stock. It is not possible to state the actual effect of the issuance of any shares of preferred stock on the rights of holders of the Common Stock until the Board determines the specific rights of the holders of the preferred stock; however, these effects may include:\n\n● | Restricting dividends on the Common Stock;  \n---|---  \n● | Diluting the voting power of the Common Stock;  \n● | Impairing the liquidation rights of the Common Stock; or  \n● | Delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company without further action by the stockholders.  \n  \n**Options**\n\nNone.\n\n**Notes**\n\nNone.\n\n**Warrants**\n\nNone.\n\n**Exclusive Forum**\n\nOur Charter provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company to the Company or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to said Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage lawsuits against us or our directors or officers. The provision does not apply to any actions arising under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as is set forth in Article VII of our Certificate of Incorporation. _See_ \"_Risk Factors—Our Certificate of Incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us_.”\n\n**Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law**\n\nWe are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL regulating corporate takeovers. This statute prevents certain Delaware corporations, under certain circumstances, from engaging in a \"business combination” with:\n\n● | a stockholder who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, otherwise known as an interested stockholder;  \n---|---  \n● | an affiliate of an interested stockholder; or  \n  \n75  \n---  \n  \n● | an associate of an interested stockholder, for three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder.  \n---|---  \n  \nA \"business combination” includes a merger or sale of more than 10% of our assets. However, the above provisions of Section 203 do not apply if:\n\n● | our Board approves the transaction that made the stockholder an \"interested stockholder,” prior to the date of the transaction; or  \n---|---  \n● | after the completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, that stockholder owned at least 85% of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, other than statutorily excluded shares of Common Stock.  \n  \n**Transfer Agent and Registrar**\n\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our Common Stock is Transhare Corporation, located at Bayside Center 1, 17755 US Highway 19N, Suite 140, Clearwater, Florida 33764. Transhare’s phone number is 303-662-1112 and its website is www.transhare.com.\n\n**Listing**\n\nOur Common Stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \"MGOL.”\n\n**DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES WE ARE OFFERING**\n\n**Common Stock**\n\nThe material terms and provisions of our Common Stock are described under the caption \"Description of Securities.”\n\n**Pre-funded Warrants to be issued in this Offering**\n\nThe following summary of certain terms and conditions of the Pre-funded Warrants is not complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the provisions of Pre-funded Warrant, the form of which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. Prospective investors should carefully review the terms and provisions of the form of Pre-funded Warrant for a complete description of the terms and conditions of the Pre-funded Warrants.\n\n_General_\n\nThe term \"pre-funded” refers to the fact that the purchase price of the Pre-funded Warrants in this offering includes almost the entire exercise price that will be paid under the Pre-funded Warrants, except for a nominal remaining exercise price of $0.00001. The purpose of the Pre-funded Warrants is to enable investors that may have restrictions on their ability to beneficially own more than 4.99% (or, at the election of the holder, 9.99%) of our outstanding Common Stock following the consummation of this offering the opportunity to invest capital into the Company without triggering their ownership restrictions, by receiving Pre-funded Warrants in lieu of shares of our Common Stock which would result in such ownership of more than 4.99% (or, at the election of the holder, 9.99%), and receiving the ability to exercise their option to purchase the shares underlying the Pre-funded Warrants at a nominal price at a later date.\n\n_Form_\n\nThe Pre-funded Warrants will be issued as individual warrant agreements to the investors. You should review the form of Pre-funded Warrant, filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, for a complete description of the terms and conditions applicable to the Pre-funded Warrants.\n\n76  \n---  \n  \n_Exercisability_\n\nThe Pre-funded Warrants are exercisable at any time after their original issuance. The Pre-funded Warrants will be exercisable, at the option of each holder, in whole or in part, by delivering to us a duly executed exercise notice accompanied by payment in full in immediately available funds for the number of shares of our Common Stock purchased upon such exercise (except in the case of a cashless exercise as described below). A holder (together with its affiliates) may not exercise any portion of the Pre-funded Warrant to the extent that the holder would own more than 4.99% (or, at the election of the holder, 9.99%) of the outstanding Common Stock immediately after exercise, except that upon at least 61 days’ prior notice from the holder to us, the holder may increase the amount of ownership of outstanding stock after exercising the holder’s Pre-funded Warrants up to 9.99% of the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the Pre-funded Warrants.\n\n_Duration and Exercise Price_\n\nThe exercise price per whole share of our Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Pre-funded Warrants is $0.00001 per share of Common Stock. The Pre-funded Warrants will be immediately exercisable and may be exercised at any time until the Pre-funded Warrants are exercised in full.\n\n_Cashless Exercise_\n\nIf, at any time after the issuance of the Pre-funded Warrants, the holder exercises its pre-funded warrants and a registration statement registering the issuance of the shares of Common Stock underlying the Pre-funded Warrants under the Securities Act is not then effective or available (or a prospectus is not available for the resale of shares of Common Stock underlying the Pre-funded Warrants), then in lieu of making the cash payment otherwise contemplated to be made to us upon such exercise in payment of the aggregate exercise price, the holder shall instead receive upon such exercise (either in whole or in part) only the net number of shares of Common Stock determined according to a formula set forth in the Pre-funded Warrants. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event we do not have or maintain an effective registration statement, there are no circumstances that would require us to make any cash payments or net cash settle the Pre-funded Warrants to the holders.\n\n_Transferability_\n\nSubject to applicable laws, the Pre-funded Warrants may be offered for sale, sold, transferred or assigned at the option of the holder upon surrender of the Pre-funded Warrants to us together with the appropriate instruments of transfer.\n\n_Exchange Listing_\n\nThere is no established trading market for the Pre-funded Warrants and we do not plan on applying to list the Pre-funded Warrants on The Nasdaq Capital Market any other national securities exchange or any other nationally recognized trading system.\n\n_Fundamental Transactions_\n\nIf, at any time while the Pre-funded Warrants are outstanding, (1) we consolidate or merge with or into another corporation whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation, (2) we sell, lease, license, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, or any of our significant subsidiaries, (3) any purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by us or another individual or entity) is completed pursuant to which holders of our Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of our Common Stock, (4) we consummate a securities purchase agreement or other business combination with another person or entity whereby such other person or entity acquires more than 50% of our outstanding Common Stock, or (5) we effect any reclassification or recapitalization of our Common Stock or any compulsory exchange pursuant to which our Common Stock is converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, or each, a \"Fundamental Transaction,” then upon any subsequent exercise of pre-funded warrants, the holders thereof will have the right to receive the same amount and kind of securities, cash or property as they would have been entitled to receive upon the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction if they had been, immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction, the holder of the number of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon exercise of those pre-funded warrants, and any additional consideration payable as part of the Fundamental Transaction.\n\n77  \n---  \n  \n_Rights as a Stockholder_\n\nExcept by virtue of such holder’s ownership of shares of our Common Stock or as otherwise set forth in the Pre-Funded Warrants, the holder of a Pre-funded Warrant does not have the rights or privileges of a holder of our Common Stock, including any voting rights, until the holder exercises the Pre-funded Warrant.\n\n**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**\n\nWe are offering on a best efforts basis up to 2,100,840 shares of Common Stock or Pre-Funded Warrants, based on an assumed public offering price of $2.38 per share (or $[*] Pre-funded Warrant), which represents the closing price of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC on November 19, 2024, for gross proceeds of up to approximately $5,000,000 before deduction of placement agent fees and offering expenses. There is no minimum amount of proceeds that is a condition to closing of this offering.

The placement agent is not purchasing or selling any securities, nor is it required to arrange for the purchase and sale of any specific number or dollar amount of securities, other than to use its \"best efforts” to arrange for the sale of the securities by us.

As an underwriter, the placement agent would be required to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, including, without limitation, Rule 10b-5 and Regulation M under the Exchange Act. These rules and regulations may limit the timing of purchases and sales of our securities by the placement agent acting as principal. Under these rules and regulations, the placement agent (i) may not engage in any stabilization activity in connection with our securities and (ii) may not bid for or purchase any of our securities or attempt to induce any person to purchase any of our securities, other than as permitted under the Exchange Act, until it has completed its participation in the distribution.\n\n**Determination of Offering Price**\n\nThe actual offering price of the securities we are offering were negotiated between us, the placement agent and the investors in the offering based on the trading of our shares of Common Stock prior to the offering, among other things. Other factors considered in determining the public offering price of the securities we are offering include our history and prospects, the stage of development of our business, our business plans for the future and the extent to which they have been implemented, an assessment of our management, the general conditions of the securities markets at the time of the offering and such other factors as were deemed relevant.\n\n79  \n---  \n  \n**Electronic Distribution**\n\nA prospectus in electronic format may be made available on a website maintained by the placement agent. In connection with the offering, the placement agent or selected dealers may distribute prospectuses electronically.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity(deficit), and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nExplanatory Paragraph- Going Concern\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022. The Company had a net loss of $7,370,465 and $2,877,357 and net cash used in operating activities of $6,978,788 and $1,683,292, respectively. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters to be communicated, are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\n\nWe did not identify any critical audit matters that need to be communicated.\n\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001902794/000149315224048071/fin_002.jpg)\n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2023.\n\nCoral Springs, Florida\n\nJune 3, 2024, except for discontinued operations and Note 8, specifically the reverse stock split, as to which the date is August 13, 2024\n\n**ASSURANCE DIMENSIONS, LLC**\n\n**also d/b/a McNAMARA and ASSOCIATES, LLC**\n\n**TAMPA BAY:** 4920 W Cypress Street, Suite 102 **|** Tampa, FL 33607 **|** Office: 813.443.5048 **|** Fax: 813.443.5053\n\n**JACKSONVILLE:** 7800 Belfort Parkway, Suite 290 **|** Jacksonville, FL 32256 **|** Office: 888.410.2323 **|** Fax: 813.443.5053\n\n**ORLANDO:** 1800 Pembrook Drive, Suite 300 **|** Orlando, FL 32810 **|** Office: 888.410.2323 **|** Fax: 813.443.5053\n\n**SOUTH FLORIDA:** 3111 N.

(\"MGO,” \"MGO Global,” the \"Company,” \"we,” \"our” and \"us”) has built a brand acceleration platform with a focus on the acquisition, optimization and monetization of consumer brands across multiple categories. Our mission is to provide customers with unmatched variety, quality and shopping experience, while adding considerable value for MGO’s shareholders.\n\nOur accomplished leadership team encompasses decades of experience in building successful global lifestyle brands, including fashion design, marketing, technology, corporate finance and branding. We strive to continually push innovation and evolution of the consumer product cycle without compromising quality and design integrity. Through our end-to-end, scalable brand-building platform, backed by robust consumer behavioral data, we are engaged in nurturing digitally native brands that will thrive in the modern Direct to Consumer (\"DTC”) economy.\n\nWe operate our business through three subsidiaries: MGOTeam1, LLC (\"MGOTeam1”); Americana Liberty, LLC and MGO Digital LLC.\n\nOn July 18, 2024, the Company effected a reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock at a ratio of 1-for-10.\n\n**_The Messi Store/MGOTeam 1 LLC_**\n\nMGOTeam1 designs, manufactures, licenses, distributes, advertises and sells a range of products under the soccer legend Lionel (‘Leo”) Messi brand, _Messi Brand_. The _Messi Brand_ is a premium lifestyle brand with a sporty edge and sells their products under their website www.themessistore.com.\n\nOn October 29, 2018, the Company entered into a Trademark License Agreement with Leo Messi Management SL (\"LMM”). LMM granted the Company a worldwide non-exclusive license in order to use Leo Messi’s trademarks with the purpose of developing, manufacturing, trading and promoting The Messi Brand products.\n\nOn November 20, 2021, the Company entered into a new Trademark License Agreement with LMM to have the worldwide license to use Leo Messi’s trademarks for the purpose of developing, manufacturing, marketing, and promoting his products. The Company is to pay LMM a minimum guaranteed amount on account of royalties amounting to Four Million Euros (4,000,000 €) over the four-year agreement, net of taxes with the last payment due on November 15, 2024.\n\nOn March 21, 2024, MGO assigned the Messi License to Centric Brands, which paid the Company $2,000,000 in cash and assumed the obligation to pay the minimum guaranteed amount due to LMM in 2024. The Company accounted for The Messi Store segment as discontinued operations. _See Notes 2, 13 and 14._\n\n**_Stand Flagpoles/Americana Liberty, LLC_**\n\nOn March 13, 2023, we obtained a royalty-free, worldwide and exclusive license (the \"License”) to the use of certain assets of Stand Co., LLC (\"Stand”) for all purposes in exchange for payment of $1.00 by the Company. The license is in perpetuity. Licensed assets include all rights to all stock keeping units (\"SKU”) of Stand sold under the names: \"Roosevelt Premium 25 foot Telescoping Flag Pole Kit,” \"20 Foot Telescoping Flag Pole Kit” and \"LED Solar Flag Pole Light;” any intellectual property and other intangible property related to SKUs, including but not limited to all rights to a brand name \"Stand Flagpoles,” domain and website www.standflagpoles.com, the Meta pages associated with \"Stand Flagpoles” brand name (in Facebook and Instagram); all manufacturer, distributor and customer contracts and relationships for SKUs; marketing materials; any commercialization rights; domain and administrative access to Stand’s Shopify account, Facebook Assets & Accounts; all historical digital and non-digital assets; and customer database since inception.\n\nF-7  \n---  \n  \nIn support of our new flagpole business, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Americana Liberty, LLC (\"Americana Liberty”), on March 13, 2023, which was created to advertise and sell the licensed line of Stand Flagpoles and other related products, along with an expanding line of patriotic-themed products to be developed and marketed to consumers under our new Americana Liberty brand.\n\nIn addition, on May 11, 2023, we executed a 12-month consulting agreement with Jason Harward, the owner of Stand Co. and nephew of our former Chief Marketing Officer of the Company. The consultant shall furnish the Company with business continuity and consulting services, substantially similar to the following: providing general advice and counsel regarding establishment of systems and processes for direct-to-consumer (\"DTC”) and ecommerce sales and operations; provide subject matter and product-level expertise in the area of flag-poles, flags, and related products; provide consultation regarding product sourcing and distribution; and assist with the establishment, operation, optimization, and maintenance of DTC and ecommerce platforms on behalf of the Company. Consultant will be compensated for services through a combination of cash or immediately available funds and restricted stock units or shares of the Company’s stock as follows: (1) cash in the amount of $150,000, paid on September 30, 2023; (2) cash in the amount of $200,000, paid on January 10, 2024, upon satisfactory performance of the consultant’s obligations under the agreement; (3) 15,000 restricted stock units of the Company issuable on May 11, 2023 and subject to vesting in equal quarterly installments throughout the term of the agreement commencing on January 31, 2024. $109,679 was recorded as stock-based compensation for the fair value of the restricted stock units awarded as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**_MGO Digital LLC_**\n\nIn November 2022, we formed MGO Digital LLC to leverage data analytics, advanced technology-enabled marketing and our leadership team’s industry relationships and expertise to identify, incubate and test market new proprietary brands and brand concepts.\n\n**NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\nBasis of Presentation \n\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP”) and include all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s financial position for the periods presented.\n\nMGOTeam1 was formed on October 11, 2018, and the Company entered into a Rollover Agreement by and among MGOTeam1 and members of MGOTeam1 on December 6, 2021. All of the members of MGOTeam1, except for one member who owns a 11.82% membership interest in MGOTeam1, exchanged all of their membership interests in MGOTeam1 for 881,800 shares of the Company’s common stock. A sole MGOTeam1’s member did not rollover its 11.82% membership interest in MGOTeam1 to the Company as of December 6, 2021, and remains a member in MGOTeam1.\n\nF-8  \n---  \n  \nWe account for the 11.82% remaining minority interest in MGOTeam1 as non-controlling interest. Both the Company and MGOTeam1 were under common control, the series of contractual arrangements between the Company and MGOTeam1 in December 6, 2021 constituted a reorganization under common control and are required to be retrospectively applied to the consolidated financial statements at their historical amounts.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nReclassifications\n\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to reflect the impact of the discontinued operations treatment in order to conform to the current period presentation. In addition, on July 18, 2024, the Company effected a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-10. Accordingly, the financial statements presented in this Form 10-K/A have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split historically.\n\nEstimates\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our most critical estimates include those related to stock-based compensation, inventory and inventory allowance valuation. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company maintains its cash with high credit quality financial institutions; at times, such balances with any one financial institution may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC”) insured limit of $250,000. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $586,013 and $0 in excess of the federal insurance limit, respectively.\n\nAccounts Receivable\n\nAccounts receivables are carried at their estimated collectible amounts, net of any estimated allowances for credit losses. We grant unsecured credit to our wholesale customers which are deemed creditworthy. Ongoing credit evaluations are performed and potential credit losses estimated by management are charged to operations on a regular basis. At the time any particular account receivable is deemed uncollectible, the balance is charged to the allowance for credit losses. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had no allowance for credit losses.\n\nInventory\n\nInventory consists of raw materials and finished goods ready for sale and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We value inventories using the weighted average costing method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. We regularly review inventory and consider forecasts of future demand, market conditions and product obsolescence. If the estimated realized value of our inventory is less than cost, we make provisions in order to reduce its carrying value to its estimated net realizable value. The write downs are recognized as a component of cost of sales. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had no allowances for inventory obsolescence.\n\nF-9  \n---  \n  \nProperty and Equipment, Net\n\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures for renewals and improvements that significantly add to the productivity capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed. When equipment is retired or sold, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resultant gain or loss is reflected in income. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method, based on useful lives of the assets which is three years for computers, equipment and software. Depreciation expense from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, was $6,502 and $0, respectively. Accumulated depreciation from continuing operations as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $6,503 and $0, respectively.\n\nSCHEDULE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET USEFUL LIFE\n\nUseful Life | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---|---  \nComputer equipment and software | 3 years | $| 308,774 | $|  -  \nFurniture | 3 years | 17,191 | -  \nTotal property and equipment | 325,965  \nLess: Accumulated depreciation | (6,503| ) | -  \nProperty and equipment, net | $| 319,462 | $| -  \n  \nLeases\n\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception or modification of the arrangement. An arrangement is or contains a lease if there are identified assets and the right to control the use of an identified asset is conveyed for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control over the use of the identified asset means the lessee has both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and the right to direct the use of the asset. The Company executed a one-year office lease in February 2023. Due to the short-term nature of the lease, the Company did not account for the lease as a right of use asset. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, the Company renewed the office lease for an additional one-year term.\n\nAccounts Payable\n\nThe composition of accounts payable and accrued expenses from continuing operations are as follows:\n\nSCHEDULE OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES\n\nDecember 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \nAccounts payable | $| 184,677 | $| -  \nAccounts payable, related party | 5,678 | -  \nAccounts payable | 5,678 | -  \nAccrued liabilities | 216,297 | 9,972  \nAccrued payroll | 533,643 | -  \nTotal accounts payable and accrued expenses | $| 940,295 | $| 9,972  \n  \nF-10  \n---  \n  \nWarrants\n\nThe Company accounts for a warrant as an equity instrument, liability or share-based compensation in accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, and/or ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation, depending on the specific terms of the agreement.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nStock-based compensation expense reflects the fair value of stock-based awards measured at the grant date and recognized over the requisite service period. The Company estimates the fair value of each stock-based option award on the measurement date using the Black-Scholes option valuation model which incorporates assumptions as to stock price volatility, the expected life of the options, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. For restricted stock awards, the Company records the value of the Company stock at the date of the grant as stock-based compensation expense.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes revenues when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which it expects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company recognizes revenues following the five step model prescribed under ASU No. 2014-09: (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation.\n\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of _Messi Brand_ and _Stand Flagpoles_ products comprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through direct wholesale or online sales through our websites _www.themessistore.com_ and _www.standflagpole.com_. We satisfy the performance obligation and record revenues when transfer of control to the customer has occurred, based on the terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product. Control is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Control transfers to online customers at the time upon receipt of the goods. The transactions price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 30 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of sale for direct wholesale and online transactions.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company generated revenues of $3,668,926 and $0, respectively, directly from consumers via our website.\n\nThe following table presents net revenue by geographic location which is recognized at a point in time:\n\nSCHEDULE OF NET REVENUE BY GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 | Total  \n---|---  \nUnited States | $| 3,667,176  \nRest of the World | 1,750  \nTotal Revenues | $| 3,668,926  \nYear Ended December 31, 2022 | **Total**  \n---|---  \nUnited States | $|  -  \nRest of the World | -  \nTotal Revenues | $| -  \n  \nF-11  \n---  \n  \nNon-Controlling Interest\n\nAs of December 6, 2021, one shareholder did not rollover its 11.82% membership interest from MGOTEAM LLC to MGOTEAM 1 LLC. According to ASC 810, _Consolidation_ , the carrying amount of the non-controlling interest (\"NCI”) will be adjusted to reflect the change in the NCI’s ownership interest in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the NCI is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized in additional paid in capital and attributed to the equity holders of the parent. The Company accounted for this portion of shares as non-controlling interest in net loss of $227,061 and $294,411 from the net loss for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nForeign currency\n\nThe Company’s functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. The resulting monetary assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the subsequent balance sheet date. Revenue and expense components are translated to U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates in effect during the period. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recognized in other income, net within the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nSegment Reporting\n\nOn March 21, 2024, the Company discontinued operations of The Messi Store due to the Deed executed with Centric, LMM and the Company. As such, the Company is no longer required to provide segment reporting, as the Company has only one reportable segment as of June 30, 2024.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, the Company generally considers all expected future events other than enactments of changes in the tax law. For deferred tax assets, management evaluates the probability of realizing the future benefits of such assets. The Company establishes valuation allowances if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon its ability to realize the deferred tax assets. Management has considered the Company’s history of cumulative net losses incurred and has concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of the deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established against the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022\n\nF-12  \n---  \n  \nThe Company recognizes the tax effects of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date and then only in an amount more likely than not to be sustained upon review by the tax authorities. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. The Company classifies potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as income tax expense. As of the year ended December 31, 2023 there was no income tax expense reported by the Company.\n\nNet Loss Per Share\n\nBasic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss available to ordinary shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted net loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential common shares had been issued if such additional common shares were dilutive. Since the Company had net losses for all the periods presented, basic and diluted loss per share are the same, and additional potential common shares have been excluded, as their effect would be anti-dilutive. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, total stock options of 114,000 and 0, respectively, and warrants of 15,978 and 70,000, respectively, were not included in the net loss per share calculation as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.\n\nFair Value Measurements\n\nThe Company has determined the fair value of certain assets and liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which provides a framework for measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques should maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nA fair value hierarchy has been established, which prioritizes the valuation inputs into three broad levels. Level 1 inputs consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the related asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs related to the asset or liability. \n\n**Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements**\n\nIn June 2016 and subsequently amended in March 2022, the FASB issued ASC 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurements of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\"ASC 326”), which replaces the existing incurred loss model with a current expected credit loss (\"CECL”) model that requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The Company would be required to use a forward-looking CECL model for accounts receivables, guarantees and other financial instruments. The Company adopted ASC 326 on January 1, 2023 and ASC 326 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07 – Segment Reporting (Topic ASC 280) Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The ASU improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosure about significant segment expenses. The enhancements under this update require disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM”) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, require disclosure of _other segment items_ by reportable segment and a description of the composition of _other segment items_ , require annual disclosures under ASC 280 to be provided in interim periods, clarify use of more than one measure of segment profit or loss by the CODM, require that the title of the CODM be disclosed with an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of segment profit or loss to make decisions, and require that entities with a single reportable segment provide all disclosures required by this update and required under ASC 280. ASU 2023-07 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect that this guidance will have a material impact upon our financial position and results of operations.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09 – Income Taxes (Topic ASC 740) Income Taxes. The ASU improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 will become effective beginning of our 2025 fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. We do not expect that this guidance will have a material impact upon our financial position and results of operations.\n\nF-13  \n---  \n  \n**NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN**\n\nIn the pursuit of MGO’s long-term growth strategy and the development of its growing portfolio of brands, the Company has incurred continued operating losses. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had a working capital surplus of $602,286. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred losses from continuing operations of $5,483,626 and $364,502 respectively, and cash used in continuing operating activities of $7,244,305 and $1,675,571, respectively. We believe the cash on hand, in connection with cash generated from future revenue, may not be sufficient to sustain continued operating losses.\n\nOn February 8, 2024, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (\"S-3”) to provide our Company with the flexibility to issue and sell securities if and when deemed appropriate to support our ongoing business operations and in the best interest of our shareholders. The S-3 contained two prospectuses: i) a base prospectus that covers the potential offering, issuance and sale from time to time of our common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities and units in one or more offerings with a total value of up to $100,000,000; and ii) a sales agreement prospectus covering the potential offering, issuance and sale from time to time of shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1,650,000 pursuant to an equity distribution agreement entered into with the New York-based investment banking firm, Maxim Group LLC (\"At-the-Market Offering” or \"ATM”). On June 7, 2024, MGO entered into an Amendment No. 1 (\"Amendment”) to the equity distribution agreement for the ATM whereby the offering size was amended to reflect an increase in the aggregate gross sales price from $1,650,000 to $3,389,384. As of June 30, 2024, we have received net proceeds from sales of our common stock pursuant to the ATM totaling an aggregate of $1,665,533. See Note 14 _._\n\nThe Company is continually evaluating strategies to obtain required additional funding to support our future operations. These strategies may include, but are not limited to, equity financing, issuing or restructuring debt, entering into other financing arrangements, and restructuring operations to increase revenues and decrease expenses. Any additional equity financing that we obtain may dilute the ownership held by our existing shareholders. The economic dilution to our shareholders will be significant if our stock price does not materially increase, or if the effective price of any sale is below the price paid by a particular shareholder. The Company may be unable to access further equity or debt financing when needed or obtain additional liquidity under acceptable terms, if at all. As such, these factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve (12) months from the date these financial statements are issued.\n\n**NOTE 4 – INVENTORY **\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, net inventories amounted to $607,022 and $0, respectively.\n\nSCHEDULE OF INVENTORY\n\nDecember 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \nFinished goods | $| 607,022 | $|  -  \nTotal | $| 607,022 | $| -  \n  \n**NOTE 5 – PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS**\n\nBALANCE SHEET ITEMS\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, prepaid expenses amounted to $185,925 and $0, respectively. \n\nSCHEDULE OF PREPAID EXPENSES\n\nDecember 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \nPrepaid expenses | $| 178,425 | $|  -  \nPrepaid rent | 7,500 | -  \nTotal | $| 185,925 | $| -  \n  \nF-14  \n---  \n  \n**NOTE 6 – LOAN PAYABLE**\n\nOn May 25, 2022, the Company entered into a loan with PayPal with an interest rate of 6.51%, principal balance of $25,000 and a monthly payment of $539 over the term of the loan.

See Note 14. $150,000 was paid in cash to the Consultant, $70,000 was accrued in selling, general, administrative expense and $109,679 related to stock-based compensation expense for the fair value of the 15,000 restricted stock units awarded per the consulting agreement were recorded as of December 31, 2023.\n\nF-15  \n---  \n  \n**NOTE 8 – STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY (DEFICIT)**\n\nSTOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n\n**_Common Stock_**\n\nOn January 12, 2023, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the \"Underwriting Agreement”) with Boustead Securities, LLC, as representative of the underwriters, relating to the Company’s initial public offering (the \"Offering”) of 172,000 shares (the \"Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (\"common stock”), which included the exercise by the underwriters in full of the over-allotment option to purchase an additional 22,500 shares of the Company’s common stock, at an Offering price of $50.00 per share. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, in exchange for the Representative’s firm commitment to purchase the Shares, the Company agreed to sell the Shares to the Representative at a purchase price of $46.50 (93% of the public offering price per Share of $50.00) and issue the underwriters three year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 8,625 shares of the Company’s common stock, which is equal to five percent (5%) of the Shares sold in the Offering. Such warrants have an exercise price of $62.50, which is equal to 125% of the Offering price (the \"Warrant”).\n\nThe Shares were offered and sold pursuant to the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-268484), as amended (the \"Registration Statement”), and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"Commission”) the final prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act”). The Registration Statement was declared effective by the Commission on January 12, 2023. The closing of the Offering for the Shares took place on January 18, 2023 with proceeds of $7,560,354, net of $1,064,646 of issuance costs, which included 22,500 shares sold by the Company upon the exercise by the underwriters of the over-allotment option in full. The Company used the net proceeds from the Offering for team expansion, marketing, general and administrative corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures.\n\nIn January 2023, the Company issued 70,000 shares to the Pre-IPO funding investors pursuant to the exercise of their warrants at fair value of $10.00 per share.\n\nIn January 2023, the Company issued 12,731 shares to Boustead Securities, LLC pursuant to the cashless exercise of their 16,448 warrants.\n\nOn January 13, 2023, in connection with the Offering, the Company commenced trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under ticker symbol \"MGOL.”\n\nIn November and December 2023, the Company issued 1,125 shares of common stock for consulting services at fair value of $5,281.\n\nIn November and December 2023, the Company issued 1,334 shares for the vested Restricted Stock Units issued to directors at fair value of $6,666.\n\nOn July 18, 2024, the Company effected a reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock at a ratio of 1-for-10.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had the following common stock transactions:\n\nThe Company issued 192,500 shares with proceeds of $1,712,564 from Pre-IPO funding, net of issuance costs of $212,436, 14,123 shares were issued to consultants for services at fair value of $141,731 and 3,000 shares were issued to a consultant for services at fair value of $30,000.

The 2022 Plan governs equity awards to our employees, directors, officers, consultants and other eligible participants. Initially, the maximum number of shares of our Common Stock that may be subject to awards under the 2022 Plan is 218,647. The maximum number of shares that are subject to awards under the 2022 Plan is subject to an annual increase equal to the lesser of (i) 50,000 shares of our Common Stock; (ii) a number of shares of our Common Stock equal to 4% of the prior year’s maximum number or (iii) such number of shares of our Common Stock as determined by the 2022 Plan administrator.\n\nOn April 12, 2024, the Board unanimously authorized and approved an amendment (\"Plan Amendment”) to MGO’s 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2022 Plan”) to increase the number of shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, (\"Common Stock”) reserved for issuance under the 2022 Plan by an additional 182,451 shares of Common Stock. Such an increase resulted in a total of 451,188 shares of Common Stock being reserved under the 2022 Plan, of which 205,071 will be available for future awards. On April 17, 2024 (the \"Record Date”), a majority of our stockholders consented to the Plan Amendment. In accordance with Rule 14c-2 of the Exchange Act, corporate actions described above will be effective no earlier than twenty (20) days after a Schedule 14C Information Statement has been mailed to our stockholders, which was mailed on April 29, 2024.\n\nThe types of awards permitted under the 2022 Plan include nonqualified stock options, qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units and other awards. Each option shall be exercisable at such times and subject to such terms and conditions as the Board may specify.\n\nEquity awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s ordinary shares at the date of grant; those options have ten-year contractual terms and vest according to the vesting plan as designated by management, generally between immediate vesting to three-year continued service term. Certain equity awards provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control, as defined in the plans.\n\nThe fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black Scholes option-pricing model. The Company uses historical option exercise and termination data to estimate the term the options are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected dividend yield is calculated using historical dividend amounts and the stock price at the option issue date. The expected volatility is determined using the volatility of peer companies.\n\nF-17  \n---  \n  \n**_Stock Options_**\n\nOn August 1, 2023, MGO issued a total of 135,500 stock options of the Company’s Common Stock to certain directors and consultants of the Company at an exercise price of $50.00 per share and a vesting period which commenced on August 1, 2023.

Utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the \"ownership change” limitations provided by Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and other similar state provisions. Any annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization.\n\nThe Company has not recorded any income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022, due to the benefit of net operating losses in these periods. The reconciliation between the federal statutory income tax rate of 21% and the blended state income tax rate of 5.5% to the Company’s effective tax for the periods presented is as follows:\n\nSCHEDULE OF EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE\n\nAmount | Percent | Amount | Percent  \n---|---|---|---  \nYear Ended December 31,  \n2023 | 2022  \nAmount | Percent | Amount | Percent  \nFederal provision at statutory rate | $| (1,409,660| ) | 21.0| % | $| (604,245| ) | 21.0| %  \nState income taxes | (390,684| ) | 5.5| % | - | -  \nNon-deductible expenses | (116,921| ) | - | 21,226 | (0.7| )%  \nChange in valuation allowance | 1,917,265 | - | 583,019 | (20.3| )%  \nEffective tax rate | $| - | 0| % | $| - | 0.0| %  \n  \nThe Company’s effective tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance.\n\nThe Company periodically evaluates the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and adjusts the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets by the valuation allowance to the extent the future realization of the deferred tax assets is not judged to be more likely than not. The Company considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of its deferred tax assets, including its recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income or loss, the carryforward periods available to the Company for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors.\n\nFuture changes in the unrecognized tax benefit will have no impact on the effective tax rate due to the existence of the valuation allowance. The Company estimates that the unrecognized tax benefit will not change significantly within the next twelve months. The Company classifies income tax penalties and interest as part of general and administrative expense in its consolidated statements of operations. There were no interest or penalties accrued as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities generally for a period of three years from the later of each return due date or date filed.\n\n**NOTE 11 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**\n\nThe Company is subject to credit, liquidity and market risks, as well as other payment-related risks, such as risks associated with the fraudulent use of credit or debit cards and customer banking information, which could have adverse effects on our business and revenues due to chargebacks from customers.\n\nF-19  \n---  \n  \n**_Legal Proceedings_**\n\nWe are not currently involved in any litigation that we believe could have a materially adverse effect in our financial condition or results of operations. From time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings, asserted claims and investigations in the ordinary course of business, including commercial claims, employment and other matters, which management considers immaterial, individually and in the aggregate. The Company makes a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The requirement for these provisions is reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and costly. Protracted litigation and/or an unfavorable resolution of one or more of proceedings, claims or investigations against the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.\n\n**NOTE 12 – SEGMENT INFORMATION**\n\n_Removed in its entirety due to the recast of discontinued operations of The Messi Store._\n\n**NOTE 13 – DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS**\n\nIn accordance with ASC 205-20 Presentation of Financial Statements: Discontinued Operations, a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported as discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major impact on an entity’s operations and financial results when the components of an entity meet the criteria in ASC paragraph 205-20-45-10. In the period in which the component meets the held for sale or discontinued operations criteria the major assets, other assets, current liabilities and non-current liabilities shall be reported as a component of total assets and liabilities separate from those balances of the continuing operations. At the same time, the results of all discontinued operations, less applicable income taxes (benefit), shall be reported as components of net income (loss) separate from the income (loss) of continuing operations.\n\nOn March 21, 2024, the Company, Centric and LMM signed a Deed of Novation, Assignment and Assumption (the \"Deed”) providing for MGOTeam1 to assign all of its rights and obligations under the existing Trademark License Agreement to Centric, and Centric has agreed to assume all of MGO’s rights and obligations in respect of the License Agreement, and the minimum guaranteed royalty amount due to LMM, with effect on and from March 21, 2024.\n\nAs a result of the Deed, the Company ceased operations of _The Messi Store_. The historical results of this business segment have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.\n\nSubsequent to the receipt of the $2,000,000 in proceeds from Centric, MGOTeam1 paid MGO Global, Inc. $2,000,000 for payment on a $2,658,635 Intercompany Demand Note. The remaining balance of the Intercompany Demand Note of $658,635 is eliminated in consolidation.\n\nSCHEDULE OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nSummary reconciliation of Discontinued Operations | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---|---  \nRevenues | $| 1,690,949 | $| 1,048,014  \nCost of sales | 1,044,048 | 419,573  \nGross profit | 646,901 | 628,441  \nOperating expenses  \nSelling, general, administrative expenses | 250,899 | 1,336,176  \nMarketing and e-commerce expenses | 988,399 | 515,673  \nRoyalty expenses | 1,269,556 | 1,273,105  \nTotal operating expenses | 2,508,854 | 3,125,451  \nOperating income (loss) | (1,861,953| ) | (2,497,513| )  \nInterest expense | 456 | 13,181  \nGain on settlement of debt | (3,500| ) | -  \nOther expense | 27,930 | 2,161  \nTotal other expense | 24,886 | 15,342  \nNet income (loss) | $| (1,886,839| ) | $| (2,512,855| )  \nLess: net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest | (227,061| ) | (294,411| )  \nNet income (loss) attributable to MGO stockholders | $| (1,659,778| ) | $| (2,217,444| )  \n  \nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the carrying amounts of major classes of assets and liabilities of the Company classified as discontinued operations as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n\nDecember 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \nCurrent assets  \nCash | $| 98,466 | $| 81,677  \nAccounts receivable | 39,121 | 101,837  \nInventories | 117,531 | 69,546  \nOther current assets | 7,864 | 7,864  \nPrepaid royalties | 147,769  \nPrepaid expenses | 4,721 | -  \nTotal current assets | 267,703 | 408,693  \nCurrent liabilities  \nAccounts payable | 115,333 | 684,466  \nAccrued liabilities | 264,534 | 802,251  \nCurrent portion of loan payable | - | 138,840  \nTotal current liabilities | 379,867 | 1,625,557  \n  \nF-20  \n---  \n  \n**NOTE 14 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**\n\n**_Departure of Principal Financial Officer_**\n\nOn January 15, 2024, Vincent Ottomanelli resigned from his position as Chief Financial Officer of MGO. In connection with his resignation, on January 15, 2024, the independent contractor agreement between the Company and Mr. Ottomanelli, dated November 3, 2022, as amended, was terminated. Mr. Ottomanelli’s resignation did not result from any disagreement with the Company.\n\nIn connection with Mr. Ottomanelli’s resignation, the Board of Directors of the Company (the \"Board”) approved the acceleration of the vesting date of 10,000 five-year stock options previously granted to Mr. Ottomanelli by changing the vesting date to January 15, 2024.

As a consequence, the Company is not eligible for a second 180 day period, because the Company does not meet the $5,000,000 minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for initial listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. In addition, the Notice informed the Company that in light of the foregoing and in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(A), the Nasdaq staff could no longer accept a plan for the Company to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) and this matter has become an additional and separate basis for delisting the Company’s securities from Nasdaq.\n\nThe Notice further stated unless the Company requests an appeal of the above determination by April 24, 2024, Nasdaq has determined that the Company’s securities will be scheduled for delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market and will be suspended at the opening of business on April 26, 2024, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the SEC, which will remove the Company’s securities from listing and registration on The Nasdaq Stock Market.\n\nOn April 18, 2024, the Company formally requested a hearing before Nasdaq’s Hearings Panel (the \"Panel”) and such request was granted by Nasdaq on April 19, 2024.

In accordance with the Plan, MGO requested at least until August 15, 2024 to evidence compliance with the Equity Rule and Bid Price Rule for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market through execution of the Plan.\n\nOn June 14, 2024, MGO received notice from Nasdaq confirming that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the \"Panel”) has determined to grant the request of MGO to continue its listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market subject to the following:\n\n1. On or before July 15, 2024, the Company will effect a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-10. _See Note 1 and 11_.\n\n2. On or before August 15, 2024, the Company will (a) complete the transactions described to the Panel to achieve compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (or its alternatives) and (b) demonstrate compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) by evidencing a closing bid price of $1.00 or more per share for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive trading sessions;\n\n3. On or before August 21, 2024, the Company must file a Form 8-K describing these transactions and indicating its post-transaction equity. The Company may do so with a balance sheet no older than 60 days containing pro forma adjustments for significant transactions or events occurring on or before the report date.

The _Messi Brand_ is a premium lifestyle brand with a sporty edge and sold its products direct to consumers through the website www.themessistore.com.\n\nIn October 2018, the Company entered into a Trademark License Agreement with Leo Messi Management SL (\"LMM”). LMM granted the Company a worldwide non-exclusive license in order to use Leo Messi’s trademarks with the purpose of developing, manufacturing, trading and promoting the _Messi Brand_ products.\n\nOn November 20, 2021, the Company entered into a new Trademark License Agreement (\"Messi License”) with LMM to have the worldwide license to use Leo Messi’s trademarks for the purpose of developing, manufacturing, marketing and promoting his products. The Company is to pay LMM a minimum guaranteed amount on account of royalties amounting to Four Million Euros (€4,000,000) over the four-year agreement, net of taxes with the last payment due on November 15, 2024.\n\nOn March 21, 2024, MGOTeam1 assigned the Messi License to Centric Brands, LLC (\"Centric”), which paid MGOTeam1 $2,000,000 in cash and assumed the obligation to pay the minimum guaranteed amount due to LMM in 2024.

The Company, Merger Sub, Holdings, HMI and HMI Shareholders are sometimes referred to herein individually as a \"Party” and, collectively, as the \"Parties.”\n\nPursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, the Parties will effect a business combination involving the following transactions (collectively, the \"Business Combination”):\n\n(a) | Merger Sub will merge (the \"Merger”) with and into the MGO, with MGO continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings;  \n---|---  \n(b) | all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of MGO (the \"MGO Common Stock”) prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into the right to receive common shares of Holdings (the \"Holdings Common Shares”) on a one-for-one basis;  \n(c) | immediately after the effective time of the Merger, the HMI Shareholders will transfer all the outstanding shares of common stock of HMI (the \"HMI Shares”) to Holdings (the \"HMI Share Acquisition”), with HMI becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings; and  \n(d) | Holdings shall issue to the HMI Shareholders (i) at the closing of the Business Combination (the \"Closing”), a number of Holdings Common Shares equal to (x) the number of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted and as-converted basis immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, times (y) 16.6667, divided by (z) the number of outstanding HMI Shares immediately prior to the HMI Share Acquisition and (ii) after the Closing and upon the satisfaction of certain earnout conditions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement, additional Holdings Common Shares equal to 10% of the shares issued to the Heidmar Shareholders on the Closing.  \n  \nMGO expects that the holders of MGO Common Stock and the Heidmar Shareholders will hold 5.66% and 94.34% (inclusive of shares to be distributed to advisors), respectively, of the Holdings Common Shares after the Closing, which is expected to occur late in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n**NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\n**_Basis of Presentation_**\n\nThese unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP”) and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC”). Accordingly, they do not contain all information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial statements.\n\nF-28  \n---  \n  \nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Form 10-K/A and Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2024, June 3, 2024 and August 13, 2024, respectively. Interim results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.\n\nIn the opinion of the Company’s management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all of the adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. Management acknowledges its responsibility for the preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements which reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary in its opinion for a fair statement of its consolidated financial position and the consolidated results of its operations for the periods presented.\n\nMGOTeam1 was formed on October 11, 2018, and the Company entered into a Rollover Agreement by and among MGOTeam1 and members of MGOTeam1 on December 6, 2021. All of the members of MGOTeam1, except for one member who owns a 11.82% membership interest in MGOTeam1, exchanged all of their membership interests in MGOTeam1 for 881,800 shares of the Company’s common stock. A sole MGOTeam1 member did not rollover its 11.82% membership interest in MGOTeam1 to the Company as of December 6, 2021, and remains a member in MGOTeam1.\n\nWe account for the 11.82% minority interest in MGOTeam1 as non-controlling interest. Both the Company and MGOTeam1 were under common control, the series of contractual arrangements between the Company and MGOTeam1 on December 6, 2021 constituted a reorganization under common control and are required to be retrospectively applied to the consolidated financial statements at their historical amounts.\n\n**_Principles of Consolidation_**\n\nThe unaudited consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n**_Reclassifications_**\n\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to reflect the impact of the discontinued operations treatment in order to conform to the current period presentation. In addition, on July 18, 2024, the Company effected a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-10. Accordingly, the financial statements presented in this Form 10-Q have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split historically.\n\n**_Discontinued Operations_**\n\nOn March 20, 2024, MGOTeam1 entered into a term sheet with Centric, providing for the terms and conditions for MGOTeam1 to assign and Centric to assume the existing Trademark License Agreement (\"License Agreement”), dated November 21, 2021, with an expiration date of December 31, 2024 (\"Expiration Date”), between Leo Messi Management SL (\"LMM”) and MGOTeam1. Pursuant to the term sheet, Centric assumed the Company’s minimum guarantee obligation to LMM under the License Agreement for payment due dates in 2024 amounting to €1,500,000. MGO received full payment of the $2,000,000 consideration on March 22, 2024.\n\nOn March 21, 2024, the Company, Centric and LMM signed a Deed of Novation, Assignment and Assumption (the \"Deed”) providing for MGOTeam1 to assign all of its rights and obligations under the License Agreement to Centric, and Centric agreed to assume all of MGO’s rights and obligations in respect of the License Agreement with effect on and from March 21, 2024. No other assets or liabilities were assumed. _See Note 10._\n\nF-29  \n---  \n  \n**_Use of Estimates_**\n\nThe preparation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our most critical estimates include those related to stock-based compensation, inventory and inventory allowance valuation. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n**_Cash and Cash Equivalents_**\n\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company maintains its cash with high credit quality financial institutions; at times, such balances with any one financial institution may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC”) insured limits. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $1,177,368 and $586,446 in excess of the FDIC limit for cash from continuing operations, respectively.\n\n**_Accounts Receivable_**\n\nAccounts receivables are carried at their estimated collectible amounts, net of any estimated allowances for credit losses. We grant unsecured credit to our wholesale customers who are deemed creditworthy. Ongoing credit evaluations are performed, and potential credit losses estimated by management are charged to operations on a regular basis. At the time any particular account receivable is deemed uncollectible, the balance is charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no allowance for credit losses from continuing operations.\n\n**_Inventory_**\n\nInventory consists of raw materials and finished goods ready for sale and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We value inventories using the weighted average costing method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. We regularly review inventory and consider forecasts of future demand, market conditions and product obsolescence. If the estimated realized value of our inventory is less than cost, we make provisions in order to reduce its carrying value to its estimated net realizable value. The write downs are recognized as a component of cost of sales. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no reserve for inventory obsolescence impairment from continuing operations.\n\n**_Property and Equipment, Net_**\n\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures for renewals and improvements that significantly add to the productivity capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed. When equipment is retired or sold, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resultant gain or loss is reflected in income. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method, based on useful lives of the assets which is three years for computers, equipment and software. Depreciation expense from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $81,590 and $38,321, respectively.\n\nSCHEDULE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET USEFUL LIFE\n\nClassification | Useful Life | **September 30, 2024** **(unaudited)** | December 31, 2023  \n---|---|---|---  \nComputer equipment and software | 3 years | $| 309,286 | $| 308,774  \nFurniture | 3 years | 17,191 | 17,191  \nProperty and equipment, gross | 325,965  \nLess: Accumulated depreciation | (88,903| ) | (6,503| )  \nProperty and equipment, net | $| 238,384 | $| 319,462  \n  \n**_Revenue Recognition_**\n\nThe Company recognizes revenues when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which it expects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company recognizes revenues following the five step model prescribed under ASU No. 2014-09: (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation.\n\nF-30  \n---  \n  \nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of _Stand Flagpoles_ products comprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through direct wholesale or online sales through our website _www.standflagpoles.com_. We satisfy the performance obligation and record revenues when transfer of control to the customer has occurred, based on the terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product. Control is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Control transfers to online customers at the time upon receipt of the goods. The transactions price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 30 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of sale for direct wholesale and online transactions.\n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company generated revenues of $565,400 and $2,661,253, and $1,054,161 and $2,823,601, respectively, directly from consumers via our website. The Company does not have any major customers as revenue is primarily direct to individual consumers. All revenues for September 30, 2024 and 2023 were generated by customers within the United States. There were no sales to customers outside of the United States during either reporting period.\n\n_Non-Controlling Interest_\n\nAs of December 6, 2021, one shareholder did not rollover its 11.82% membership interest in MGOTeam1. According to ASC 810, _Consolidation_ , the carrying amount of the non-controlling interest (\"NCI”) will be adjusted to reflect the change in the NCI’s ownership interest in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the NCI is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized in additional paid in capital and attributed to the equity holders of the parent. The Company accounted for this portion of shares as non-controlling interest in net income of $5,229 and net loss of $(62,800) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; and net income of $229,073 and a net loss of $(185,556) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively\n\n_Foreign Currency_\n\nThe Company’s functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. The resulting monetary assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the subsequent balance sheet date. Revenue and expense components are translated to U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates in effect during the period. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recognized in other income, net within the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n_Segment Reporting_\n\nOn March 21, 2024, the Company discontinued operations of _The Messi Store_ due to the Deed executed with Centric, LMM and the Company. As such, the Company is no longer required to provide segment reporting, as the Company has only one reportable segment as of September 30, 2024.\n\n_Income Taxes_\n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, the Company generally considers all expected future events other than enactments of changes in the tax law. For deferred tax assets, management evaluates the probability of realizing the future benefits of such assets. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets when evidence suggests it is unlikely that the assets will be fully realized.\n\nThe Company recognizes the tax effects of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date and then only in an amount more likely than not to be sustained upon review by the tax authorities. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold is recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold is derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. The Company classifies potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as income tax expense.\n\nF-31  \n---  \n  \n_Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements_\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07 – Segment Reporting (Topic ASC 280) Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The ASU improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosure about significant segment expenses. The enhancements under this update require disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM”) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, require disclosure of _other segment items_ by reportable segment and a description of the composition of _other segment items_ , require annual disclosures under ASC 280 to be provided in interim periods, clarify use of more than one measure of segment profit or loss by the CODM, require that the title of the CODM be disclosed with an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of segment profit or loss to make decisions, and require that entities with a single reportable segment provide all disclosures required by this update and required under ASC 280. ASU 2023-07 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASC 280 on January 1, 2024 and ASC 280 does not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n_Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted_\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09 – Income Taxes (Topic ASC 740) Income Taxes. The ASU improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 will become effective at the beginning of our 2025 fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. We do not expect that this guidance will have a material impact upon our financial position and results of operations.\n\n**NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN**\n\nIn the pursuit of MGO’s long-term growth strategy and the development of its growing portfolio of brands, the Company has incurred continued operating losses. As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of $2,393,015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred losses from continuing operations of ($5,663,027) and ($3,596,339), respectively, and cash used in operating activities of ($4,715,475) and $(6,396,563), respectively. We believe the cash on hand, in connection with cash generated from future revenue, may not be sufficient to sustain continued operating losses. These factors cause substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date these financial statements were made available.\n\nOn February 8, 2024, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (\"S-3”) to provide our Company with the flexibility to issue and sell securities if and when deemed appropriate to support our ongoing business operations and in the best interest of our shareholders. The S-3 contained two prospectuses: i) a base prospectus that covers the potential offering, issuance and sale from time to time of our common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities and units in one or more offerings with a total value of up to $100,000,000; and ii) a sales agreement prospectus covering the potential offering, issuance and sale from time to time of shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1,650,000 pursuant to an equity distribution agreement entered into with the New York-based investment banking firm, Maxim Group LLC (\"At-the-Market Offering” or \"ATM”). On June 7, 2024, MGO entered into an Amendment No. 1 (\"Amendment”) to the equity distribution agreement for the ATM whereby the offering size was amended to reflect an increase in the aggregate gross sales price from $1,650,000 to $3,389,384. As of September 30, 2024, we exhausted the ATM and received net proceeds from sales of our common stock pursuant to the ATM totaling an aggregate of $3,215,752.\n\n**NOTE 4 – BALANCE SHEET ITEMS**\n\n**_Inventory_**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, inventory amounted to $1,049,359 and $607,022, respectively.\n\nF-32  \n---  \n  \n**_Prepaid Expenses_**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, prepaid expenses amounted to $56,979 and $178,425, respectively.\n\nSCHEDULE OF PREPAID EXPENSES\n\n**September 30, 2024** **(unaudited)** | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nPrepaid expenses | $| 49,479 | $| 5,577  \nPrepaid rent | 7,500 | 7,500  \nPrepaid inventories | - | 165,348  \nTotal | $| 56,979 | $| 178,425  \n  \n**_Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities (Including Related Parties)_**\n\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities were $152,929 and $940,296 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Accounts payable are mainly payables to vendors and accrued liabilities consist of mainly credit card payable and sales tax payable.\n\nSCHEDULE OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES\n\n**September 30, 2024** **(unaudited)** | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nAccounts payable | $| 51,170 | $| 184,677  \nAccounts payable, related party | 2,769 | 5,678  \nAccounts payable | 2,769 | 5,678  \nAccrued liabilities | 40,340 | 216,297  \nAccrued payroll | 58,648 | 533,643  \nTotal | $| 152,927 | $| 940,295  \n  \n**_Commitments and Contingencies_**\n\nIn January 2024, the Company entered into a financing agreement for the Company’s Directors and Officers insurance policy with First Insurance Funding at an interest rate of 7.58%, a principal balance of $225,185 and a monthly payment of $23,308 over the nine-month term of the promissory note. The loan matured on October 12, 2024 and the policy is paid in full as of the maturity date. The policy term is January 2024 through December 2024.\n\nOn August 7, 2024, Americana Liberty entered into a business loan agreement (the \"Loan Agreement”) and a promissory note (the \"Note”) for $250,000 revolving line of credit (the \"Loan Agreement”) with Platinum Bank with an interest rate of 8.15% per annum. The line of credit matures August 7, 2026. There were no borrowings on the line of credit as of September 30, 2024.\n\nIn connection with the Loan Agreement, the Company signed a commercial guaranty (the \"Guaranty”) dated August 7, 2024, pursuant to which it guarantees full and punctual payment of the indebtedness of Americana Liberty under the Loan Agreement and the Note. The Company and Americana Liberty also signed an assignment of deposit account (the \"Assignment”), dated August 7, 2024, pursuant to which the Company assigned and granted to Platinum Bank a security interest in the savings account with Platinum Bank with an approximate balance of $250,000, all interest accrued, all additional deposits made to the account, any and all proceeds from such account, as well as all renewals, replacements, and substitutions for any of the foregoing.\n\n**_Nasdaq Deficiency Notices, Hearings Panel Determinations and Reverse Stock Split_**\n\nOn April 17, 2024, the Company received a notice (the \"Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market (\"Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that 180 calendar day period that it had been provided by Nasdaq to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) on April 16, 2024 did not result in the Company regaining compliance. As a consequence, the Company is not eligible for a second 180 day period, because the Company does not meet the $5,000,000 minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for initial listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. In addition, the Notice informed the Company that in light of the foregoing and in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(A), the Nasdaq staff could no longer accept a plan for the Company to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) and this matter has become an additional and separate basis for delisting the Company’s securities from Nasdaq.\n\nThe Notice further stated unless the Company requests an appeal of the above determination by April 24, 2024, Nasdaq has determined that the Company’s securities will be scheduled for delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market and will be suspended at the opening of business on April 26, 2024, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the SEC, which will remove the Company’s securities from listing and registration on The Nasdaq Stock Market.\n\nOn April 18, 2024, the Company formally requested a hearing before Nasdaq’s Hearings Panel (the \"Panel”) and such request was granted by Nasdaq on April 19, 2024. The hearing date was scheduled for May 30, 2024.\n\nOn May 30, 2024, senior members of MGO’s executive team and the Company’s SEC counsel participated in the hearing before the Nasdaq’s Hearings Panel and endeavored to address all questions and concerns posed by the panelists relating to the Company’s plan to regain compliance with the continued listing standards (the \"Plan”) – the Plan was formally submitted to the members of the Nasdaq Hearings Panel on May 8, 2024. In accordance with the Plan, MGO requested at least until August 15, 2024 to evidence compliance with the Equity Rule and Bid Price Rule for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market through execution of the Plan.\n\nF-33  \n---  \n  \nOn June 14, 2024, MGO received notice from Nasdaq confirming that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the \"Panel”) has determined to grant the request of MGO to continue its listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market subject to the following:\n\n1. On or before July 15, 2024, the Company will effect a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-10. _See Note 1 and 11_.\n\n2. On or before August 15, 2024, the Company will (a) complete the transactions described to the Panel to achieve compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (or its alternatives) and (b) demonstrate compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) by evidencing a closing bid price of $1.00 or more per share for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive trading sessions;\n\n3. On or before August 21, 2024, the Company must file a Form 8-K describing these transactions and indicating its post-transaction equity. The Company may do so with a balance sheet no older than 60 days containing pro forma adjustments for significant transactions or events occurring on or before the report date. Alternatively, the Company can provide an affirmative statement that, as of the date of the report, it believes it has regained compliance with the stockholders’ equity requirement based upon the specific transactions or events described; and\n\n4. At the time of filing the Form 8-K, the Company must demonstrate compliance with all other applicable requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\n\nThe Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K on August 12, 2024, stating that the Company believes that it is in compliance with the Nasdaq minimum stockholders’ equity requirement as of August 9, 2024. However, on August 16, 2024, Nasdaq notified the Company that it was not able to confirm the Company’s compliance with the net equity requirement based on the information provided by the Company. On August 21, 2024, MGO provided supplemental information for Nasdaq and the Hearings Panel’s review.\n\nOn September 30, 2024, Nasdaq notified the Company that after reviewing the supplemental materials provided by the Company, the Hearings Panel confirmed the Company has cured the previous deficiencies with the equity requirement and the bid price requirement and the Company is back in compliance with all applicable continued listing standards\n\n**NOTE 5 – LOAN PAYABLE**\n\nOn January 24, 2024, MGO entered into a 52-week loan with PayPal for $85,000 and a $10,312 fixed loan fee, aggregating $95,312. Weekly payments are $1,833 over the life of the loan. The outstanding balance of this loan was $27,788 as of September 30, 2024.\n\n**NOTE 6 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**\n\nThe accounts payable owed to our related parties as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $2,769 and $5,678, respectively, and was comprised of employee reimbursements for September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nThe accrued payroll owed to our executives and staff as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $58,648 and $533,643, respectively, inclusive of bonuses.\n\nOn May 11, 2023, we executed a 12-month consulting agreement with Jason Harward (\"Consultant”), the owner of Stand and nephew of Matt Harward, MGO’s former Chief Marketing Officer. The consulting agreement compensation terms were $350,000 payable in two installments, the first installment was paid in September 2023 and second installment was paid in January 2024. The compensation terms included 15,000 restricted stock units awarded on January 31, 2024 which vest over the remaining life of the consulting agreement. The Company recognized $51,587 of stock-based compensation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $123,914 for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nF-34  \n---  \n  \nOn April 2, 2024, the Board of Directors (the \"Board”) of MGO, at the recommendation of the Compensation Committee (the \"Committee”), approved an increase in the base salary of Ms. Dana Perez, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, from $165,000 to $200,000 per annum. This salary increase is effective as of April 2, 2024. In addition, the Board approved an increase in the annual cash bonus which Ms. Perez will be entitled to receive based on her and the Company’s continued satisfaction of a combination of personal and Company’s goals.

Our charter provides that no director of the Company shall be personally liable to it or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director, notwithstanding any provision of law imposing such liability, except to the extent that the DGCL prohibits the elimination or limitation of liability of directors for breaches of fiduciary duty.\n\nSection 145 of the DGCL provides that a Company has the power to indemnify a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company, or a person serving at the request of the Company for another Company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise in related capacities against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with an action, suit or proceeding to which he was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, ending or completed action, suit or proceeding by reason of such position, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, in any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, except that, in the case of actions brought by or in the right of the Company, no indemnification shall be made with respect to any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Company unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or other adjudicating court determines that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all of the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.\n\nOur charter and bylaws provide for the indemnification, to the fullest extent permitted from time to time by the DGCL or any other applicable laws as presently or hereafter in effect, any person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Company or, while a director or officer of the Company, is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and reasonably incurred by such person.\n\nII-1  \n---  \n  \nOur bylaws provide that if an indemnification claim made by an officer or director of the Company is not paid in full by the Company within thirty (30) days after a written claim has been received by the Company, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Company to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where any required undertaking has been tendered to the Company) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the DGCL for the Company to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Company. Neither the failure of the Company (including its board of directors (\"Board”), legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Company (including its Board, legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.\n\nThe right of our directors and officers to indemnification under our charter and bylaws is not exclusive of any other right which they may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, our charter, our bylaws, any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.\n\nThe Company may also maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL or under the provisions of our bylaws.\n\nIn any underwriting agreement we enter into in connection with the sale of Common Stock being registered hereby, the underwriters will agree to indemnify, under certain conditions, us, our directors, our officers and persons who control us within the meaning of the Securities Act, against certain liabilities.\n\n**ITEM 15.** | **RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES**  \n---|---  \n  \nSince the Company’s incorporation on November 30,

Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.\n\n(5) That for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act to any purchaser in the initial distribution of securities, the undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:\n\n(i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;\n\nII-8  \n---  \n  \n(ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;\n\n(iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and\n\n(iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to any charter provision, by law or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.\n\nThe undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that:\n\n(1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus

For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\n\nII-9  \n---  \n  \n**SIGNATURES**\n\nPursuant to the

(“HMI”) and its controlled subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) which engages in marine transportation services on an international basis that consists of five business activities: management services to pools of vessels that share operational costs and revenues (“pool management services”), commercial management services for individual vessels (“commercial management services”), sale and purchase services for vessels, which involves assisting clients with the buying and selling of ships (“S&P services”), technical management services for individual vessels (“technical management services”) and chartering of vessels through charter in and charter out (“charter in – charter out”). Heidmar Inc. was formed under the laws of Republic of Liberia on December 3, 1987 and redomiciled into the Republic of the Marshall Islands on December 4, 2006.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include Heidmar Inc. and the following controlled subsidiaries:\n\n● | Heidmar International Pools Inc.  \n---|---  \n● | Heidmar2020 LLC  \n● | Cash Custodian Inc.  \n● | Heidmar Bulkers Inc.  \n● | Heidmar Investments LLC  \n● | Heidmar UK Limited  \n● | Heidmar UK Trading Limited  \n● | Heidmar (Far East) LLC  \n● | Heidmar (Far East) Pte.

Ltd. and exercises joint control over this entity (Note 10).\n\nThe accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial reporting. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Heidmar Inc. as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (the “2023 Financial Statements”) included in the Registration Statement of Heidmar Maritime Holdings Corp. on Form F-4 and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Operating results for the six-months ended June 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that might be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.\n\nF-7  \n---  \n  \n**Heidmar Inc.**\n\n**Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n**(Expressed in United States Dollars)**\n\n**2.** | **Significant Accounting Policies**  \n---|---  \n  \nA discussion of the Company’s significant accounting policies can be found in the 2023 Financial Statements. During the six-months ended June 30, 2024, the Company adopted the following accounting policies:\n\n**_Trade Revenues -_** Commissions earned from services provided on sale and purchase (“S&P”) of vessels and management fees earned from technical management services.\n\nManagement fees from technical management services are earned for each vessel at a fixed rate per day. The Company’s technical management services have an established duration term of four years and either party can terminate the agreement if certain conditions are met. Trade revenues are recognized when earned and when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Company and such benefit can be measured reliably.\n\nThe Company determined that its technical management service contracts consist of a single performance obligation of providing technical management services during the period of service and the revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period.\n\nIn a sales and purchase service contract, the performance obligation is typically the brokerage service fee to facilitate the sale or purchase of a vessel. This involves finding a buyer or seller, negotiating terms, and closing the transaction. Commissions arising from the S&P services are considered as earned and are recognized at the point in time when the sale transaction has been completed and the ownership of the vessel has been transferred to the new owner and therefore the performance obligation is satisfied.\n\n**_Business Acquisitions & Asset Acquisitions:_** When the Company enters into an acquisition transaction, it determines whether the acquisition transaction is a purchase of an asset or a business based on the facts and circumstances of the transaction. In accordance with Topic 805, Business Combinations, the Company first evaluates whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (Step one). If that threshold is met, the set of assets and activities is not a business. If the threshold is not met, the Company evaluates whether the set meets the definition of a business (Step two). To be considered a business, a set must include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contributes to the ability to create an output. All assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at their acquisition date fair values. For asset acquisitions, the net assets acquired should be measured following a cost accumulation and allocation model under which the cost of the acquisition is allocated on a relative fair value basis to the qualifying assets acquired. Transaction costs associated with asset acquisitions are capitalized.\n\n**_Goodwill and Intangible Assets_** : The goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business acquisition. The determination of the value of goodwill, net tangible and intangible assets arising from acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed and the excess purchase price over net assets acquired to goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized and is assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques on an annual basis or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant such a review. The goodwill is considered to be impaired if the Company determines that the carrying value of our one reporting unit exceeds its respective fair value. No impairment charge was recorded for the six-months ended June 30, 2024.\n\nF-8  \n---  \n  \n**Heidmar Inc.**\n\n**Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n**(Expressed in United States Dollars)**\n\n**2.** | **Significant Accounting Policies—(Continued)**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The quantitative assessment for goodwill requires the Company to estimate the fair value of the Company’s one reporting unit using either an income or market approach or a combination thereof.\n\nThe Company’s indefinite live Trademark is reviewed for impairment by performing a quantitative analysis, which occurs annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\nRecoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to future net discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the associated asset. If such assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the intangible assets. No impairment charge was recorded for the six-month period ended June 30, 2024.\n\nAmortizable intangible asset includes the Technical license management. Amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Amortization for licenses commences upon market launch. Amortization for assets acquired commences upon acquisition. Technical license management is amortized over a 16-year period.\n\nAmortizable intangible assets are assessed for impairment upon triggering events that indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the associated asset. If such assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the intangible assets. No impairment charge was recorded for the six-month period ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**_Acquisition Installments Payable:_** Upon the completion of an acquisition, the Company may record an acquisition installment payable. Acquisition installments payables, which are fixed future payments, are recorded at their net present value. Accretion of interest expense attributable to the acquisition installments payable is recorded as a component of finance costs.\n\n**_Investments in joint ventures:_** The Company’s investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, investments are stated at initial cost and are adjusted for subsequent additional investments and the Company’s proportionate share of earnings or losses and distributions. The Company evaluates its investments in joint ventures for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such investments may have experienced other than temporary decline in value below their carrying value. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value and is considered other than a temporary decline, the carrying value is written down to its estimated fair value and the resulting impairment is recorded in the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated statements of income. No impairment charge was recorded for the six-month period ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**3.** | **Transactions with related parties**  \n---|---  \n  \n**_Profit and Loss Sharing agreement_** :\n\nDuring the six-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the accrued interest costs of the profit and loss sharing agreement (the “Agreement”) entered into for one vessel described in Note 10 of the 2023 Financial Statements relating to Assignee A, based on the effective interest method, were $77,117 and nil and are presented under “Finance costs, related party” in the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated statements of income.\n\nF-9  \n---  \n  \n**Heidmar Inc.**\n\n**Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n**(Expressed in United States Dollars)**\n\n**3.** | **Transactions with related parties—(Continued)**  \n---|---  \n  \nPayables to Assignee A, which mainly includes the working capital provided from the Assignee A for the operations of the vessel and the recognized interest cost, are analyzed as follows:\n\nPayable to Assignee A  \n---  \nDecember 31, 2023 | 783,852  \nInterest cost | 77,117  \nJune 30, 2024 | 860,969  \n  \n**_Transactions with the Non-consolidated Pool Subsidiaries:_** The Company earns management fees and commissions from its wholly-owned subsidiaries, to which HMI provides pool management services, that are not controlled by HMI, but rather by the participants in the pools pursuant to the one vote-per-vessel contractual arrangements between HMI and the participants in the pools (the “Non-consolidated Pool Subsidiaries”).

Generally, income from the international operation of ships is subject to preferential tax regimes in the countries where the ship owning or operating companies are incorporated and exempt from income tax in other countries where the ships call due to the application of income tax treaties or, in the case of the United States, treaties or Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Among other things, in order to qualify, the Company must be incorporated in a country, which grants an equivalent exemption to U.S. corporations and must satisfy certain qualified ownership requirements.\n\nIncome earned by the Company organized outside of the United States that is not derived in connection with the international operation of ships (as such term is defined by Section 883 of the Code and the regulations promulgated there under) or earned in countries without preferential tax regimes is subject to income tax in the countries where such income is earned. Section 887 of the Code imposes a 4% gross basis tax on U.S. source gross transportation income (“USSGTI”). USSGTI is 50% of the gross revenue derived from voyages that begin or end in the United States. The Non-consolidated Pool Subsidiaries of the Company earn USSGTI. The Non-consolidated Pool Subsidiaries are incorporated in the Marshall Islands. Pursuant to the income tax laws of the Marshall Islands, these subsidiaries are not subject to income tax. The Marshall Islands has been officially recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as a qualified foreign country that currently grants the requisite equivalent exemption from tax. In addition, these subsidiaries satisfy one of the ownership tests required by Section 883 and are therefore exempt from U.S. income tax on their transportation income derived from the operation of their chartered vessels to or from U.S. ports.\n\nF-12  \n---  \n  \n**Heidmar Inc.**\n\n**Notes to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n**(Expressed in United States Dollars)**\n\n**5.** | **Income tax—(Continued)**  \n---|---  \n  \nUncertain tax positions are evaluated under the more likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.

Statements made in this report that are not statements of historical fact, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements and should be evaluated as such. Investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management and involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions, which are subject to change at any time at our discretion. Forward-looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business plan and strategies. Forward-looking statements include our assessment, from time to time of our competitive position, the industry environment, potential growth opportunities, the effects and events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, wars, epidemics or pandemics. Forward-looking statements often include words such as \"anticipates,” \"believes,” \"could,” \"forecast,” \"estimates,” \"expects,” \"suggest,” \"hopes,” \"intends,” \"may,” \"might,” \"plans,” \"potential,” \"predicts,” \"targets,” \"projects,” \"projections,” \"should,” \"could,” \"will,” \"would” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions.\n\nWhere in any forward-looking statement we express an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of our management, expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis. However, there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or will be achieved or accomplished. The following include some, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated:\n\n● | current economic conditions, including consumer spending levels and the price elasticity of our products;  \n---|---  \n● | the highly competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we compete;  \n● | our ability to successfully manage social, political, economic, legal and other conditions affecting our operations and our supply chain sources, such as political instability and acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters, disruption of markets, operational disruptions, changes in import or export laws, currency restrictions and currency exchange rate fluctuations;  \n● | the impact of the loss of one or more of our suppliers of finished goods or raw materials;  \n● | our ability to manage our inventory effectively and reduce inventory reserves;  \n● | our ability to optimize our global supply chain;  \n● | our ability to distribute our products effectively through our ecommerce store and through our growing wholesale distribution channel;  \n● | our ability to keep pace with changing consumer preferences;  \n● | the impact of any inadequacy, interruption or failure with respect to our information technology or any data security breach;  \n● | our ability to protect our reputation and the reputation and images of our licensed and any future proprietary brand(s);  \n● | unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or a change in our ability to realize deferred tax benefits;  \n● | our ability to comply with environmental and other laws and regulations;  \n● | changes in our relationship with our employees and costs and adverse publicity from violations of labor or environmental laws by us or our suppliers;  \n---|---  \n● | our ability to attract and retain key personnel; and  \n● | our ability to integrate and grow potential acquisitions successfully.  \n  \nThe reader should understand that the uncertainties and other factors listed above or identified elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in our Annual Report are not a comprehensive list of all the uncertainties and other factors that may affect forward-looking statements. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.

(\"MGO,” \"MGO Global,” the \"Company,” \"we,” \"our” and \"us”) has built a brand acceleration platform with a focus on the acquisition, optimization and monetization of consumer brands across multiple categories. Our mission is to provide customers with unmatched variety, quality and shopping experience, while adding considerable value for MGO’s shareholders.\n\nOur accomplished leadership team encompasses decades of experience in building successful global lifestyle brands, including fashion design, marketing, technology, corporate finance and branding. We strive to continually push innovation and evolution of the consumer product cycle without compromising quality and design integrity. Through our end-to-end, scalable brand-building platform, backed by robust consumer behavioral data, we are engaged in nurturing digitally native brands that will thrive in the modern Direct to Consumer (\"DTC”) economy.\n\nWe operate our business through three subsidiaries: Americana Liberty, LLC; MGO Digital LLC and MGOTeam1, LLC (\"MGOTeam1”).\n\nOn July 18, 2024, the Company effected a reverse stock split on the Company’s common stock at a ratio of 1-for-10.\n\n**_Stand Flagpoles/Americana Liberty, LLC_**\n\nOn March 13, 2023, we obtained a royalty-free, worldwide and exclusive license (the \"License”) to the use of certain assets of Stand Co., LLC (\"Stand”) for all purposes in exchange for payment of $1.00 by the Company. The license is in perpetuity. Licensed assets include all rights to all stock keeping units (\"SKU”) of Stand sold under the names: \"Roosevelt Premium 25 foot Telescoping Flag Pole Kit,” \"20 Foot Telescoping Flag Pole Kit” and \"LED Solar Flag Pole Light;” any intellectual property and other intangible property related to SKUs, including but not limited to all rights to the brand name _Stand Flagpoles_ , domain and website www.standflagpoles.com, the Meta pages associated with _Stand Flagpoles_ brand name (in Facebook and Instagram); all manufacturer, distributor and customer contracts and relationships for SKUs; marketing materials; any commercialization rights; domain and administrative access to Stand’s Shopify account, Facebook Assets & Accounts; all historical digital and non-digital assets; and customer database since inception.\n\nIn support of our flagpole business, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Americana Liberty, LLC (\"Americana Liberty”), on March 13, 2023, which was created to advertise and sell the licensed line of _Stand Flagpoles_ and other related products, along with an expanding line of patriotic-themed products to be developed and marketed to consumers under our new _Americana Liberty_ brand.\n\nIn addition, on May 11, 2023, we executed a 12-month consulting agreement with Jason Harward, the owner of Stand Co. and nephew of our former Chief Marketing Officer of the Company. The consultant shall furnish the Company with business continuity and consulting services, substantially similar to the following: provide general advice and counsel regarding the establishment of systems and processes for direct-to-consumer (\"DTC”) and e-commerce sales and operations; provide subject matter and product-level expertise in the area of flag-poles, flags, and related products; provide consultation regarding product sourcing and distribution; and assist with the establishment, operation, optimization, and maintenance of DTC and e-commerce platforms on behalf of the Company. Consultant was compensated for services through a combination of cash or immediately available funds and restricted stock units or shares of the Company’s stock as follows: (1) cash in the amount of $150,000, paid on September 30, 2023; (2) cash in the amount of $200,000, paid on January 10, 2024, upon satisfactory performance of the consultant’s obligations under the agreement; and (3) 15,000 restricted stock units of the Company issuable on May 11, 2023. The Company recorded $51,587 and $109,679 as stock-based compensation expense for the fair value of the restricted stock units awarded as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The consulting agreement ended May 2024.\n\n**_MGO Digital LLC_**\n\nIn November 2022, we formed MGO Digital LLC to leverage data analytics, advanced technology-enabled marketing and our leadership team’s industry relationships and expertise to identify, incubate and test market new proprietary brands and brand concepts.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \n**_The Messi Store/MGOTeam 1 LLC_**\n\nMGOTeam1 designed, manufactured, licensed, distributed, advertised and sold a range of products under the soccer legend Lionel (\"Leo”) Messi brand, _Messi Brand_. The _Messi Brand_ is a premium lifestyle brand with a sporty edge and sold its products direct to consumers through the website www.themessistore.com.\n\nIn October 2018, the Company entered into a Trademark License Agreement with Leo Messi Management SL (\"LMM”). LMM granted the Company a worldwide non-exclusive license in order to use Leo Messi’s trademarks with the purpose of developing, manufacturing, trading and promoting the _Messi Brand_ products.\n\nOn November 20, 2021, the Company entered into a new Trademark License Agreement (\"Messi License”) with LMM to have the worldwide license to use Leo Messi’s trademarks for the purpose of developing, manufacturing, marketing and promoting his products. The Company is to pay LMM a minimum guaranteed amount on account of royalties amounting to Four Million Euros (€4,000,000) over the four-year agreement, net of taxes with the last payment due on November 15, 2024.\n\nOn March 21, 2024, MGOTeam1 assigned the Messi License to Centric Brands, LLC (\"Centric”), which paid MGOTeam1 $2,000,000 in cash and assumed the obligation to pay the minimum guaranteed amount due to LMM in 2024. The Company accounted for _The Messi Store_ segment as discontinued operations. _See Note 10._\n\n**_Business Combination Agreement with Heidmar, Inc._**\n\nOn June 18, 2024, MGO entered into a definitive Business Combination Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Business Combination Agreement”) with Heidmar, Inc., (\"HMI”), a company organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands; Heidmar Maritime Holdings Corp., a company organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (\"Holdings”); HMR Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings (\"Merger Sub”); and Rhea Marine Ltd. and Maistros Shipinvest Corp (the \"HMI Shareholders”). The Company, Merger Sub, Holdings, HMI and HMI Shareholders are sometimes referred to herein individually as a \"Party” and, collectively, as the \"Parties.”\n\nPursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, the Parties will effect a business combination involving the following transactions (collectively, the \"Business Combination”):\n\n(a) | Merger Sub will merge (the \"Merger”) with and into the MGO, with MGO continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings;  \n---|---  \n(b) | all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of MGO (the \"MGO Common Stock”) prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into the right to receive common shares of Holdings (the \"Holdings Common Shares”) on a one-for-one basis;  \n(c) | immediately after the effective time of the Merger, the HMI Shareholders will transfer all the outstanding shares of common stock of HMI (the \"HMI Shares”) to Holdings (the \"HMI Share Acquisition”), with HMI becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings; and  \n(d) | Holdings shall issue to the HMI Shareholders (i) at the closing of the Business Combination (the \"Closing”), a number of Holdings Common Shares equal to (x) the number of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted and as-converted basis immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, times (y) 16.6667, divided by (z) the number of outstanding HMI Shares immediately prior to the HMI Share Acquisition and (ii) after the Closing and upon the satisfaction of certain earnout conditions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement, additional Holdings Common Shares equal to 10% of the shares issued to the Heidmar Shareholders on the Closing.  \n  \nMGO expects that the holders of MGO Common Stock and the Heidmar Shareholders will hold 5.66% and 94.34% (inclusive of shares to be distributed to advisors), respectively, of the Holdings Common Shares after the Closing, which is expected to occur late in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n**NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\n**_Basis of Presentation_**\n\nThese unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP”) and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC”).

Management acknowledges its responsibility for the preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements which reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary in its opinion for a fair statement of its consolidated financial position and the consolidated results of its operations for the periods presented.\n\nMGOTeam1 was formed on October 11, 2018, and the Company entered into a Rollover Agreement by and among MGOTeam1 and members of MGOTeam1 on December 6, 2021. All of the members of MGOTeam1, except for one member who owns a 11.82% membership interest in MGOTeam1, exchanged all of their membership interests in MGOTeam1 for 881,800 shares of the Company’s common stock. A sole MGOTeam1 member did not rollover its 11.82% membership interest in MGOTeam1 to the Company as of December 6, 2021, and remains a member in MGOTeam1.\n\nWe account for the 11.82% minority interest in MGOTeam1 as non-controlling interest. Both the Company and MGOTeam1 were under common control, the series of contractual arrangements between the Company and MGOTeam1 on December 6, 2021 constituted a reorganization under common control and are required to be retrospectively applied to the consolidated financial statements at their historical amounts.\n\n**_Principles of Consolidation_**\n\nThe unaudited consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n**_Reclassifications_**\n\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to reflect the impact of the discontinued operations treatment in order to conform to the current period presentation. In addition, on July 18, 2024, the Company effected a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-10. Accordingly, the financial statements presented in this Form 10-Q have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split historically.\n\n**_Discontinued Operations_**\n\nOn March 20, 2024, MGOTeam1 entered into a term sheet with Centric, providing for the terms and conditions for MGOTeam1 to assign and Centric to assume the existing Trademark License Agreement (\"License Agreement”), dated November 21, 2021, with an expiration date of December 31, 2024 (\"Expiration Date”), between Leo Messi Management SL (\"LMM”) and MGOTeam1. Pursuant to the term sheet, Centric assumed the Company’s minimum guarantee obligation to LMM under the License Agreement for payment due dates in 2024 amounting to €1,500,000. MGO received full payment of the $2,000,000 consideration on March 22, 2024.\n\nOn March 21, 2024, the Company, Centric and LMM signed a Deed of Novation, Assignment and Assumption (the \"Deed”) providing for MGOTeam1 to assign all of its rights and obligations under the License Agreement to Centric, and Centric agreed to assume all of MGO’s rights and obligations in respect of the License Agreement with effect on and from March 21, 2024. No other assets or liabilities were assumed. _See Note 10._\n\n10  \n---  \n  \n**_Use of Estimates_**\n\nThe preparation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our most critical estimates include those related to stock-based compensation, inventory and inventory allowance valuation. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n**_Cash and Cash Equivalents_**\n\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company maintains its cash with high credit quality financial institutions; at times, such balances with any one financial institution may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC”) insured limits. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $1,177,368 and $586,446 in excess of the FDIC limit for cash from continuing operations, respectively.\n\n**_Accounts Receivable_**\n\nAccounts receivables are carried at their estimated collectible amounts, net of any estimated allowances for credit losses. We grant unsecured credit to our wholesale customers who are deemed creditworthy. Ongoing credit evaluations are performed, and potential credit losses estimated by management are charged to operations on a regular basis. At the time any particular account receivable is deemed uncollectible, the balance is charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no allowance for credit losses from continuing operations.\n\n**_Inventory_**\n\nInventory consists of raw materials and finished goods ready for sale and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We value inventories using the weighted average costing method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. We regularly review inventory and consider forecasts of future demand, market conditions and product obsolescence. If the estimated realized value of our inventory is less than cost, we make provisions in order to reduce its carrying value to its estimated net realizable value. The write downs are recognized as a component of cost of sales. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no reserve for inventory obsolescence impairment from continuing operations.\n\n**_Property and Equipment, Net_**\n\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures for renewals and improvements that significantly add to the productivity capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed. When equipment is retired or sold, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resultant gain or loss is reflected in income. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method, based on useful lives of the assets which is three years for computers, equipment and software. Depreciation expense from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $81,590 and $38,321, respectively.\n\nSCHEDULE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET USEFUL LIFE\n\nClassification | Useful Life | **September 30, 2024** **(unaudited)** | December 31, 2023  \n---|---|---|---  \nComputer equipment and software | 3 years | $| 309,286 | $| 308,774  \nFurniture | 3 years | 17,191 | 17,191  \nProperty and equipment, gross  \nLess: Accumulated depreciation | (88,903| ) | (6,503| )  \nProperty and equipment, net | $| 238,384 | $| 319,462  \n  \n**_Revenue Recognition_**\n\nThe Company recognizes revenues when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which it expects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company recognizes revenues following the five step model prescribed under ASU No. 2014-09: (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation.\n\n11  \n---  \n  \nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of _Stand Flagpoles_ products comprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through direct wholesale or online sales through our website _www.standflagpoles.com_. We satisfy the performance obligation and record revenues when transfer of control to the customer has occurred, based on the terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product. Control is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Control transfers to online customers at the time upon receipt of the goods. The transactions price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 30 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of sale for direct wholesale and online transactions.\n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company generated revenues of $565,400 and $2,661,253, and $1,054,161 and $2,823,601, respectively, directly from consumers via our website. The Company does not have any major customers as revenue is primarily direct to individual consumers. All revenues for September 30, 2024 and 2023 were generated by customers within the United States. There were no sales to customers outside of the United States during either reporting period.\n\n_Non-Controlling Interest_\n\nAs of December 6, 2021, one shareholder did not rollover its 11.82% membership interest in MGOTeam1. According to ASC 810, _Consolidation_ , the carrying amount of the non-controlling interest (\"NCI”) will be adjusted to reflect the change in the NCI’s ownership interest in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the NCI is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized in additional paid in capital and attributed to the equity holders of the parent. The Company accounted for this portion of shares as non-controlling interest in net income of $5,229 and net loss of $(62,800) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; and net income of $229,073 and a net loss of $(185,556) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively\n\n_Foreign Currency_\n\nThe Company’s functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. The resulting monetary assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the subsequent balance sheet date. Revenue and expense components are translated to U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates in effect during the period. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recognized in other income, net within the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n_Segment Reporting_\n\nOn March 21, 2024, the Company discontinued operations of _The Messi Store_ due to the Deed executed with Centric, LMM and the Company. As such, the Company is no longer required to provide segment reporting, as the Company has only one reportable segment as of September 30, 2024.\n\n_Income Taxes_\n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, the Company generally considers all expected future events other than enactments of changes in the tax law. For deferred tax assets, management evaluates the probability of realizing the future benefits of such assets. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets when evidence suggests it is unlikely that the assets will be fully realized.\n\nThe Company recognizes the tax effects of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date and then only in an amount more likely than not to be sustained upon review by the tax authorities. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold is recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold is derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. The Company classifies potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as income tax expense.\n\n12  \n---  \n  \n_Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements_\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07 – Segment Reporting (Topic ASC 280) Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The ASU improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosure about significant segment expenses. The enhancements under this update require disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM”) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, require disclosure of _other segment items_ by reportable segment and a description of the composition of _other segment items_ , require annual disclosures under ASC 280 to be provided in interim periods, clarify use of more than one measure of segment profit or loss by the CODM, require that the title of the CODM be disclosed with an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of segment profit or loss to make decisions, and require that entities with a single reportable segment provide all disclosures required by this update and required under ASC 280. ASU 2023-07 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASC 280 on January 1, 2024 and ASC 280 does not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n_Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted_\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09 – Income Taxes (Topic ASC 740) Income Taxes. The ASU improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 will become effective at the beginning of our 2025 fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. We do not expect that this guidance will have a material impact upon our financial position and results of operations.\n\n**NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN**\n\nIn the pursuit of MGO’s long-term growth strategy and the development of its growing portfolio of brands, the Company has incurred continued operating losses. As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of $2,393,015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred losses from continuing operations of ($5,663,027) and ($3,596,339), respectively, and cash used in operating activities of ($4,715,475) and $(6,396,563), respectively. We believe the cash on hand, in connection with cash generated from future revenue, may not be sufficient to sustain continued operating losses. These factors cause substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date these financial statements were made available.\n\nOn February 8, 2024, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (\"S-3”) to provide our Company with the flexibility to issue and sell securities if and when deemed appropriate to support our ongoing business operations and in the best interest of our shareholders. The S-3 contained two prospectuses: i) a base prospectus that covers the potential offering, issuance and sale from time to time of our common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities and units in one or more offerings with a total value of up to $100,000,000; and ii) a sales agreement prospectus covering the potential offering, issuance and sale from time to time of shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1,650,000 pursuant to an equity distribution agreement entered into with the New York-based investment banking firm, Maxim Group LLC (\"At-the-Market Offering” or \"ATM”). On June 7, 2024, MGO entered into an Amendment No. 1 (\"Amendment”) to the equity distribution agreement for the ATM whereby the offering size was amended to reflect an increase in the aggregate gross sales price from $1,650,000 to $3,389,384. As of September 30, 2024, we exhausted the ATM and received net proceeds from sales of our common stock pursuant to the ATM totaling an aggregate of $3,215,752.\n\n**NOTE 4 – BALANCE SHEET ITEMS**\n\n**_Inventory_**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, inventory amounted to $1,049,359 and $607,022, respectively.\n\n13  \n---  \n  \n**_Prepaid Expenses_**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, prepaid expenses amounted to $56,979 and $178,425, respectively.\n\nSCHEDULE OF PREPAID EXPENSES\n\n**September 30, 2024** **(unaudited)** | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nPrepaid expenses | $| 49,479 | $| 5,577  \nPrepaid rent | 7,500 | 7,500  \nPrepaid inventories | - | 165,348  \nTotal | $| 56,979 | $| 178,425  \n  \n**_Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities (Including Related Parties)_**\n\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities were $152,929 and $940,296 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Accounts payable are mainly payables to vendors and accrued liabilities consist of mainly credit card payable and sales tax payable.\n\nSCHEDULE OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES\n\n**September 30, 2024** **(unaudited)** | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nAccounts payable | $| 51,170 | $| 184,677  \nAccounts payable, related party | 2,769 | 5,678  \nAccounts payable | 2,769 | 5,678  \nAccrued liabilities | 40,340 | 216,297  \nAccrued payroll | 58,648 | 533,643  \nTotal | $| 152,927 | $| 940,295  \n  \n**_Commitments and Contingencies_**\n\nIn January 2024, the Company entered into a financing agreement for the Company’s Directors and Officers insurance policy with First Insurance Funding at an interest rate of 7.58%, a principal balance of $225,185 and a monthly payment of $23,308 over the nine-month term of the promissory note. The loan matured on October 12, 2024 and the policy is paid in full as of the maturity date. The policy term is January 2024 through December 2024.\n\nOn August 7, 2024, Americana Liberty entered into a business loan agreement (the \"Loan Agreement”) and a promissory note (the \"Note”) for $250,000 revolving line of credit (the \"Loan Agreement”) with Platinum Bank with an interest rate of 8.15% per annum. The line of credit matures August 7, 2026. There were no borrowings on the line of credit as of September 30, 2024.\n\nIn connection with the Loan Agreement, the Company signed a commercial guaranty (the \"Guaranty”) dated August 7, 2024, pursuant to which it guarantees full and punctual payment of the indebtedness of Americana Liberty under the Loan Agreement and the Note. The Company and Americana Liberty also signed an assignment of deposit account (the \"Assignment”), dated August 7, 2024, pursuant to which the Company assigned and granted to Platinum Bank a security interest in the savings account with Platinum Bank with an approximate balance of $250,000, all interest accrued, all additional deposits made to the account, any and all proceeds from such account, as well as all renewals, replacements, and substitutions for any of the foregoing.\n\n**_Nasdaq Deficiency Notices, Hearings Panel Determinations and Reverse Stock Split_**\n\nOn April 17, 2024, the Company received a notice (the \"Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market (\"Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that 180 calendar day period that it had been provided by Nasdaq to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) on April 16, 2024 did not result in the Company regaining compliance. As a consequence, the Company is not eligible for a second 180 day period, because the Company does not meet the $5,000,000 minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for initial listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. In addition, the Notice informed the Company that in light of the foregoing and in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(A), the Nasdaq staff could no longer accept a plan for the Company to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) and this matter has become an additional and separate basis for delisting the Company’s securities from Nasdaq.\n\nThe Notice further stated unless the Company requests an appeal of the above determination by April 24, 2024, Nasdaq has determined that the Company’s securities will be scheduled for delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market and will be suspended at the opening of business on April 26, 2024, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the SEC, which will remove the Company’s securities from listing and registration on The Nasdaq Stock Market.\n\nOn April 18, 2024, the Company formally requested a hearing before Nasdaq’s Hearings Panel (the \"Panel”) and such request was granted by Nasdaq on April 19, 2024. The hearing date was scheduled for May 30, 2024.\n\nOn May 30, 2024, senior members of MGO’s executive team and the Company’s SEC counsel participated in the hearing before the Nasdaq’s Hearings Panel and endeavored to address all questions and concerns posed by the panelists relating to the Company’s plan to regain compliance with the continued listing standards (the \"Plan”) – the Plan was formally submitted to the members of the Nasdaq Hearings Panel on May 8, 2024. In accordance with the Plan, MGO requested at least until August 15, 2024 to evidence compliance with the Equity Rule and Bid Price Rule for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market through execution of the Plan.\n\n14  \n---  \n  \nOn June 14, 2024, MGO received notice from Nasdaq confirming that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the \"Panel”) has determined to grant the request of MGO to continue its listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market subject to the following:\n\n1. On or before July 15, 2024, the Company will effect a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-10. _See Note 1 and 11_.\n\n2. On or before August 15, 2024, the Company will (a) complete the transactions described to the Panel to achieve compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (or its alternatives) and (b) demonstrate compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) by evidencing a closing bid price of $1.00 or more per share for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive trading sessions;\n\n3. On or before August 21, 2024, the Company must file a Form 8-K describing these transactions and indicating its post-transaction equity. The Company may do so with a balance sheet no older than 60 days containing pro forma adjustments for significant transactions or events occurring on or before the report date. Alternatively, the Company can provide an affirmative statement that, as of the date of the report, it believes it has regained compliance with the stockholders’ equity requirement based upon the specific transactions or events described; and\n\n4. At the time of filing the Form 8-K, the Company must demonstrate compliance with all other applicable requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\n\nThe Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K on August 12, 2024, stating that the Company believes that it is in compliance with the Nasdaq minimum stockholders’ equity requirement as of August 9, 2024. However, on August 16, 2024, Nasdaq notified the Company that it was not able to confirm the Company’s compliance with the net equity requirement based on the information provided by the Company. On August 21, 2024, MGO provided supplemental information for Nasdaq and the Hearings Panel’s review.\n\nOn September 30, 2024, Nasdaq notified the Company that after reviewing the supplemental materials provided by the Company, the Hearings Panel confirmed the Company has cured the previous deficiencies with the equity requirement and the bid price requirement and the Company is back in compliance with all applicable continued listing standards\n\n**NOTE 5 – LOAN PAYABLE**\n\nOn January 24, 2024, MGO entered into a 52-week loan with PayPal for $85,000 and a $10,312 fixed loan fee, aggregating $95,312.

The consulting agreement compensation terms were $350,000 payable in two installments, the first installment was paid in September 2023 and second installment was paid in January 2024. The compensation terms included 15,000 restricted stock units awarded on January 31, 2024 which vest over the remaining life of the consulting agreement. The Company recognized $51,587 of stock-based compensation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $123,914 for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n15  \n---  \n  \nOn April 2, 2024, the Board of Directors (the \"Board”) of MGO, at the recommendation of the Compensation Committee (the \"Committee”), approved an increase in the base salary of Ms. Dana Perez, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, from $165,000 to $200,000 per annum.

Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, in exchange for the Representative’s firm commitment to purchase the Shares, the Company agreed to sell the Shares to the Representative at a purchase price of $46.50 (93% of the public offering price per Share of $50.00) and issue the underwriters three-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 8,625 shares of the Company’s common stock, which is equal to five percent (5%) of the Shares sold in the Offering. Such warrants have an exercise price of $6.25, which is equal to 125% of the Offering price (the \"Warrant”).\n\nThe Shares were offered and sold pursuant to the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-268484), as amended (the \"Registration Statement”), and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"Commission”) and the final prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act”). The Registration Statement was declared effective by the Commission on January 12, 2023. The closing of the Offering for the Shares took place on January 18, 2023 with net proceeds of $7,560,354, which included 22,500 shares sold by the Company upon the exercise by the underwriters of the over-allotment option in full.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**\n\n_The following discussion highlights the principal factors that have affected our financial condition and results of operations as well as our liquidity and capital resources for the periods described. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Form 10-K/A and Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2024, June 3, 2024 and August 13, 2024, respectively_. _As discussed in the section titled \"Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements._\n\n**Overview**\n\nFounded in October 2018 and headquartered in Florida with remote employees and specialty contractors in London, New York and Latin America, MGO Global Inc. (\"MGO,” \"MGO Global,” the \"Company,” \"we,” \"our” and \"us”) has built a brand acceleration platform with a focus on the acquisition, optimization and monetization of consumer brands across multiple categories. Our mission is to provide customers with unmatched variety, quality and shopping experience, while adding considerable value for MGO’s shareholders.\n\nOur accomplished leadership team encompasses decades of experience in building successful global lifestyle brands, including fashion design, marketing, technology, corporate finance and branding. We strive to continually push innovation and evolution of the consumer product cycle without compromising quality and design integrity. Through our end-to-end, scalable brand-building platform, backed by robust consumer behavioral data, we are engaged in nurturing digitally native brands that will thrive in the modern Direct to Consumer (\"DTC”) economy.\n\n**_Stand Flagpoles/Americana Liberty, LLC_**\n\nOn March 13, 2023, we obtained a royalty-free, worldwide and exclusive license (the \"License”) to the use of certain assets of Stand Co., LLC (\"Stand”) for all purposes in exchange for payment of $1.00 by the Company. The license is in perpetuity. Licensed assets include all rights to all stock keeping units (\"SKU”) of Stand sold under the names: \"Roosevelt Premium 25 foot Telescoping Flag Pole Kit,” \"20 Foot Telescoping Flag Pole Kit” and \"LED Solar Flag Pole Light;” any intellectual property and other intangible property related to SKUs, including but not limited to all rights to a brand name \"Stand Flagpoles,” domain and website www.standflagpoles.com, the Meta pages associated with \"Stand Flagpoles” brand name (in Facebook and Instagram); all manufacturer, distributor and customer contracts and relationships for SKUs; marketing materials; any commercialization rights; domain and administrative access to Stand’s Shopify account, Facebook Assets & Accounts; all historical digital and non-digital assets; and customer database since inception.\n\nIn support of our new flagpole business, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Americana Liberty, LLC (\"Americana Liberty”), on March 13, 2023, which was created to advertise and sell the licensed line of _Stand Flagpoles_ and other related products, along with an expanding line of patriotic-themed products to be developed and marketed to consumers under our new _Americana Liberty_ brand.\n\nIn addition, on May 11, 2023, we executed a 12-month consulting agreement with Jason Harward, the owner of Stand Co. and nephew of our former Chief Marketing Officer of the Company. The consultant shall furnish the Company with business continuity and consulting services, substantially similar to the following: providing general advice and counsel regarding establishment of systems and processes for direct-to-consumer (\"DTC”) and ecommerce sales and operations; provide subject matter and product-level expertise in the area of flag-poles, flags, and related products; provide consultation regarding product sourcing and distribution; and assist with the establishment, operation, optimization, and maintenance of DTC and ecommerce platforms on behalf of the Company. Consultant was compensated for services through a combination of cash or immediately available funds and restricted stock units or shares of the Company’s stock as follows: (1) cash in the amount of $150,000, paid on September 30, 2023; (2) cash in the amount of $200,000, paid on January 10, 2024, upon satisfactory performance of the consultant’s obligations under the agreement; (3) 15,000 restricted stock units of the Company which were issued on January 31, 2024 and subject to vesting in equal quarterly installments throughout the term of the agreement commencing on January 31, 2024. $51,587 and $109,679 was recorded as stock-based compensation expense for the fair value of the restricted stock units awarded as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\n**_MGO Digital LLC_**\n\nIn November 2022, we formed MGO Digital LLC to leverage data analytics, advanced technology-enabled marketing and our leadership team’s industry relationships and expertise to identify, incubate and test market new proprietary brands and brand concepts.\n\n**_The Messi Store/MGOTeam 1 LLC_**\n\nOur subsidiary, MGOTeam1 LLC (\"MGOTeam1”), designed, manufactured, licensed, distributed, advertised, and sold a range of products under the soccer legend Lionel (\"Leo”) Messi brand, _Messi Brand_. The _Messi Brand_ is a premium lifestyle brand with a sporty edge and sold their products direct to consumers through the website www.themessistore.com.\n\n20  \n---  \n  \nOn October 29, 2018, MGOTeam1 entered into a Trademark License Agreement with Leo Messi Management SL (\"LMM”). LMM granted MGOTeam1 a worldwide non-exclusive license in order to use Leo Messi’s trademarks with the purpose of developing, manufacturing, trading and promoting _Messi Brand_ Products.\n\nOn November 20, 2021, MGOTeam1 entered into a new Trademark License Agreement (the \"Messi License”) with LMM to have the worldwide license to use Leo Messi’s trademarks for the purpose of developing, manufacturing, marketing and promoting his products. MGOTeam1 was to pay LMM a minimum guaranteed amount on account of royalties amounting to Four Million Euros (€4,000,000) over the four-year agreement, net of taxes with the last payment due on November 15, 2024.\n\nOn March 21, 2024, MGOTeam1 assigned the Messi License to Centric Brands LLC (\"Centric”), which paid MGOTeam1 $2,000,000 in cash and assumed the obligation to pay the minimum guaranteed amount due to LMM in 2024.\n\n**_Business Combination Agreement with Heidmar, Inc._**\n\nOn June 18, 2024, MGO entered into a definitive Business Combination Agreement (the \"Business Combination Agreement” or \"BCA”) with Heidmar, Inc., (\"Heidmar”), a company organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Heidmar Maritime Holdings Corp., a company organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (\"Holdings”), HMR Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings (\"Merger Sub”), and Rhea Marine Ltd. and Maistros Shipinvest Corp (collectively, the \"Heidmar Shareholders”). The Company, Merger Sub, Holdings, Heidmar and Heidmar Shareholders are sometimes referred to herein individually as a \"Party” and, collectively, as the \"Parties.”\n\nPursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, MGO, Heidmar, Holdings, Merger Sub and the Heidmar Shareholders will effect a business combination involving the following Transactions (collectively, the \"Business Combination”):\n\n(a) | Merger Sub will merge (the \"Merger”) with and into MGO, with MGO continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings;  \n---|---  \n(b) | all of the issued and outstanding MGO Shares prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into the right to receive Holdings Shares on a one-for-one basis;  \n(c) | immediately after the effective time of the Merger, the Heidmar Shareholders will transfer all their Heidmar Shares to Holdings (the \"Heidmar Share Acquisition”), with Heidmar becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings; and  \n(d) | Holdings will issue to the Heidmar Shareholders and MGO’s financial advisor: (i) at the Closing (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), the Heidmar Share Consideration (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), and (ii) after the Closing and upon the satisfaction of certain earnout conditions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement, the Earnout Shares (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), with 2.64% of each issuance being distributed to MGO’s financial advisor.  \n  \nFollowing the Closing, both MGO and Heidmar will be wholly owned subsidiaries of Holdings, and the Holdings Shares will be publicly listed on Nasdaq. The parties expect that after the Closing, the Heidmar Shareholders will own 94.34% of Holdings (including shares that Holdings will distribute to MGO’s financial advisor) and the MGO stockholders will own 5.66% of Holdings, without taking into account the issuance of any Earnout Shares. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, any shares of common stock that MGO issues prior to the Closing will not change these percentages.\n\nThe boards of directors of both companies have unanimously approved the signing of the BCA.\n\nOn August 22, 2024, the Company and Heidmar jointly announced the confidential submission of a draft registration statement on Form F-4 with the SEC in connection with the planned Business Combination of MGO and Heidmar.\n\nThe Business Combination is expected to close late in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to satisfying certain customary closing conditions, including the receipt of approvals from MGO’s stockholders and the listing of Holdings registered common shares on Nasdaq.\n\nFor a more detailed description of the Business Combination, Heidmar, Holdings and the risk factors related to the Business Combination, please see our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on June 20, 2024.\n\n21  \n---  \n  \n**_Nasdaq Deficiency Notices, Hearings Panel Determinations and Reverse Stock Split_**\n\nOn October 19, 2023, the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\"Nasdaq”) therein stating that for the 30 consecutive business day period between September 7, 2023 through October 18, 2023, the common stock of the Company had not maintained a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \"Bid Price Rule”). Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company was provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until April 16, 2024 (the \"Compliance Period”), to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule.\n\nOn April 5, 2024, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq stating that the Company is no longer in compliance with the equity standard for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) requires listed companies to maintain stockholders’ equity of at least $2,500,000 under the equity standard. Because the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023 reported stockholders’ equity of $921,747, and as of April 5, 2024 the Company does not meet the alternative standards for market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations, the Company no longer complies with Nasdaq’s Listing Rule. Nasdaq provided the Company with 45 calendar days, or until May 20, 2024, to submit a plan to regain compliance.\n\nOn April 17, 2024, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq notifying the Company that 180 calendar day period that it had been provided by Nasdaq to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) on April 16, 2024 without the Company regaining compliance and is not eligible for a second 180 day period, because the Company does not meet the $5,000,000 minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for initial listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. In addition, Nasdaq informed the Company that in light of the foregoing and in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(A), the Nasdaq staff could no longer accept a plan for the Company to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) and this matter has become an additional and separate basis for delisting the Company’s securities from Nasdaq. On April 18, 2024, the Company formally requested a hearing before Nasdaq’s Hearings Panel and such request was granted by Nasdaq on April 19, 2024. A hearing before Nasdaq’s Hearings Panel was scheduled for May 30, 2024.\n\nOn May 30, 2024, Nasdaq held a hearing to make a determination on MGO’s continued listing in light of its non-compliance with above-referenced Nasdaq rules, which continued listing was granted subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including:\n\n● | on or before July 15, 2024, MGO will effect a reverse stock split at a ratio between 1-for-10 and 1-for-25, unless prior to such date MGO has been informed in writing by Nasdaq that it has regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2);  \n---|---  \n● | on or before August 15, 2024, MGO will (x) complete the transactions described to Nasdaq Hearings Panel to achieve compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (or its alternatives) and (y) demonstrate compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) by evidencing a closing bid price of $1.00 or more per share for a minimum of ten consecutive trading sessions; and  \n● | on or before August 21, 2024, MGO will file a Current Report on Form 8-K describing the transactions that have increased its stockholders’ equity and either (x) indicate that, through a balance sheet that is not older than 60 days and contains pro forma adjustments for the transactions, stockholders equity has increased to at least $2.5 million or (y) an affirmative statement that, as of the date of such report, it believes it has regained compliance with the stockholders’ equity requirement based upon the specific transactions or events described in such report.  \n  \nOn July 18, 2024, MGO effected a reverse stock split at a 1-for-10 ratio that resulted in 2,122,607 MGO shares of common stock being outstanding after the reverse stock split.\n\nThe Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K on August 12, 2024, stating that we believe that we are in compliance with the Nasdaq minimum stockholders’ equity requirement as of August 9, 2024. However on August 16, 2024, Nasdaq notified the Company that it was not able to confirm the Company’s compliance with the net equity requirement based on the information provided by MGO. On August 21, 2024, MGO provided supplemental information for Nasdaq’s and the Hearings Panel’s review.\n\nOn September 30, 2024, Nasdaq notified the Company that after reviewing the supplemental materials provided by the Company, the Hearings Panel confirmed the Company has cured the previous deficiencies with the equity requirement and the bid price requirement and the Company is back in compliance with all applicable continued listing standards.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \n**Results of Operations for Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023**\n\n_Revenues_\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same three months in 2023, revenues decreased 46.4% to $565,400 from $1,054,161. The decrease over the prior year’s comparable period is attributable to the fact that the Company reduced marketing expenses during the third quarter of 2024 in an effort to increase profitability while consciously reducing marketing costs, which helped in successfully increasing gross margin. Revenues reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $2,661,253, representing an 5.7% decrease over revenues of $2,823,601 posted for the comparable nine-month period in 2023. The modest decrease over the prior year’s comparable three and nine month periods is primarily attributable to the decrease in marketing spend in the third quarter of 2024, as noted above.\n\n_Cost of Sales and Gross Profit_\n\nCost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 decreased 69.2% to $72,414 from $235,003, respectively. This resulted in a gross profit of $492,986 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which compared to $819,158 for the same three-month period in 2023. Gross profit margin rose to 88.0% from 78.0% on a comparable three-month basis.\n\nCost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $586,502, down 23.0% from $761,473 reported for the same nine-month period in the prior year. This resulted in a 0.6% increase in gross profit of $2,074,751 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2,062,128 for the nine-month ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit margin rose to 78.0% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 from 73.0% reported for the same nine-month period in the prior year.\n\n_Operating Expenses_\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, total operating expenses decreased 35.1% to $1,850,717 as compared to total operating expenses of $2,850,658 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to a 24.0% decline in selling, general and administrative expenses, which decreased to $1,386,146 from $1,827,926, respectively, primarily due to a reduction in stock-based compensation expense in the third quarter of 2024 versus the same period in 2023; and a 54.6% decrease in marketing and e-commerce expenses, which declined to $464,571 from $1,022,732, respectively. The decrease in marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the prior year’s same three-month period is attributable to the fact that the Company made cognitive efforts to focus on a higher return on marketing spend. In addition, warehouse and shipping costs decreased from the prior year due to one-time expenditures in 2023 of shipping the licensed goods to the Company’s new third-party fulfillment center.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was $7,738,241, representing a 36.0% increase compared to $5,688,343 in total operating expenses for the same nine months in 2023. The increase was largely attributable to a 71.8% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, which rose to $5,711,978 from $3,325,737, respectively; and a 14.2% decrease in marketing and e-commerce expenses, which declined to $2,026,263 from $2,362,606, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related to workforce expansion, stock-based compensation expenses which were not occurring in the prior six month period of 2023, and increased costs of legal and accounting expenses pertaining to executing capital raises and advancing the business combination process with Heidmar during the first nine months of 2024. The decrease in marketing and e-commerce expenses is due to the Company making a cognitive effort to focus on higher returns on marketing spend during 2024.\n\n_Other (Income) Expenses_\n\nTotal other income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $10,927 and $10,463, respectively, compared to total other interest income of $0 and $29,876 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \n_Net Loss_\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, net loss from continuing operations was $1,346,804, a 33.7% decrease from a net loss of $2,031,500 reported for the same three-month period in 2023. Net income from discontinued operations increased to $44,237 from a net loss of $520,613 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Overall, net loss totaled $1,302,567 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $2,552,113 for the same three-month period ended September 30, 2023. After factoring net income of $5,229 and a net loss of $62,800 for non-controlling interest for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, net loss attributable to MGO stockholders was $1,307,796, or $0.52 loss per share, and $2,489,313, or $1.79 loss per share, respectively.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net loss from continuing operations was $5,653,027, a 57.2% increase from a net loss of $3,596,339 reported for the same nine-month period in 2023. Net income from discontinued operations rose to $1,938,008 from a net loss of $1,574,104 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as a result of the assignment of the Messi License to Centric. Overall, net loss totaled $3,715,019 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $5,170,443 posted for the same nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. After factoring net income of $229,073 and a net loss of $185,556 for non-controlling interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, net loss attributable to MGO stockholders was $3,944,092, or $1.90 loss per share, and $4,984,887, or $3.67 loss per share, respectively.\n\n**Cash Flows**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, cash on hand from continuing operations was $1,435,288, as compared to $836,446 as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 72%. The increase was primarily attributable to the assignment of the _Messi Brand_ to Centric in exchange for $2,000,000 in cash and their assumption of our obligation to pay €1.5 million in royalty payments to LMM in 2024, as well as net proceeds aggregating $3,215,752 received from the sale of our common stock pursuant to our At-The-Market Offering (\"ATM”). Until such time that the Company fully implements its growth strategy or completes its business combination with Heidmar, it expects to continue generating operating losses in the foreseeable future, primarily due to higher corporate overhead, higher marketing and inventory expenses and costs associated with being a public company.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operations was $4,715,475, a decrease of 26% as compared to cash used in operations of $6,396,563 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to the assignment of the _Messi Brand_ to Centric in exchange for $2,000,000 in cash and their assumption of our obligation to pay €1.5 million in royalty payments to Leo Messi Management in 2024.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by investing activities was $1,999,488, compared to cash used in investing activities of $179,853 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 1212% increase was due to no significant purchases of property and equipment occurring during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, offset by the $2,000,000 in proceeds received from the assignment of the _Messi Brand_ to Centric.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by financing activities was $3,218,540, a decrease of 61% as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $8,183,514 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was directly related to the completion of the Company’s initial public offering in January 2023.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of $2,393,015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a loss from continuing operations of $5,653,027, inclusive of $5,711,978 for general and administrative expenses, including higher workforce expenses, stock-based compensation expense, third-party logistics services, professional fees and rent expense for office space, as well as $2,026,263 for marketing and ecommerce expenses.\n\nOn March 21, 2024, MGO assigned the Messi License to Centric, which paid the Company $2,000,000 in cash and assumed the obligation to pay the minimum guaranteed amount due to LMM in 2024. Effective as of that date, the Company discontinued operations on _The Messi Store_.\n\nOn February 12, 2024, the SEC deemed the Company’s shelf registration statement on Form S-3 effective. This registration statement contained two prospectuses: 1) a base prospectus that covers the potential offering, issuance, and sale from time to time of our common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities and units in one or more offerings with a total value of up to $100,000,000; and 2) a sales agreement prospectus (\"ATM”) covering the potential offering, issuance, and sale from time to time of shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1,650,000 pursuant to an equity distribution agreement with Maxim Group LLC. On June 7, 2024, MGO entered into an Amendment No. 1 (\"Amendment”) to the equity distribution agreement for the ATM whereby the offering size was amended to reflect an increase in the aggregate gross sales price from $1,650,000 to $3,389,384. As of the date of this report, the Company had received net proceeds of $3,215,752 from sales of shares of our common stock pursuant to the ATM and has exhausted the ATM.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \nIf the Company is unable to generate significant sales growth in the near term and raise additional capital, there is a risk that the Company could default on additional obligations; and could be required to discontinue or significantly reduce the scope of its operations if no other means of financing operations are available. Moreover, any additional equity financing that we obtain may dilute the ownership held by our existing shareholders. The economic dilution to our shareholders will be significant if our stock price does not materially increase, or if the effective price of any sale is below the price paid by a particular shareholder. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities or any other adjustment that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. As such, the aforementioned factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period.\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments, and Use of Estimates**\n\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"US GAAP”). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our most critical estimates include those related to revenue recognition, inventories and reserves for excess and obsolescence, accounting for stock-based awards, and income taxes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our existing critical accounting policies which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Form 10-K/A and Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2024, June 3, 2024 and August 13, 2024, respectively.\n\n**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Since our inception, except for standard operating leases, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.\n\n**Inflation**\n\nOver the past 18 months, inflation has adversely affected our business, financial condition, and results of operations by increasing our overall cost structure, and such affects will be further exacerbated if we are unable to achieve commensurate increases in the prices, we charge our customers. The existence of inflation in the economy has resulted in, and may continue to result in, higher interest rates and capital costs, shipping costs, supply shortages, increased costs of labor, weakening exchange rates, and other similar effects. As a result of inflation, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, cost increases. In addition, poor economic and market conditions, including a potential recession, may negatively impact market sentiment, decreasing the demand for sportswear and outerwear, which would adversely affect our operating income and results of operations. If we are unable to take effective measures in a timely manner to mitigate the impact of inflation, as well as a potential recession, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n**Climate Change**\n\nOur opinion is that neither climate change, nor governmental regulations related to climate change, have had, or are expected to have, any material effect on our operations.\n\n25  \n---  \n  \n**New Accounting Pronouncements**\n\nThere were certain updates recently issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB”), most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n**ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK**\n\nAs a \"smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this Item.\n\n**ITEM 4.

Lauderdale, FL 33304** | **7667 10th St N**  \n**Oakdale, MN 55128**  \n**Principal Amount: $250,000.00** | **Date of Note: August 7, 2024**  \n---|---  \n  \n**PROMISE TO PAY. Americana Liberty LLC (“Borrower”) promises to pay to Platinum Bank (“Lender”), or order, in lawful money of the United States of America, the principal amount of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand & 00/100 Dollars ($250,000.00) or so much as may be outstanding, together with interest on the unpaid outstanding principal balance of each advance, calculated as described in the “INTEREST CALCULATION METHOD” paragraph using an interest rate of 8.150% per annum based on a year of 360 days. Interest shall be calculated from the date of each advance until repayment of each advance. The interest rate may change under the terms and conditions of the “INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT” section.**\n\n**PAYMENT. Borrower will pay this loan in full immediately upon Lender’s demand. If no demand is made, Borrower will pay this loan in one payment of all outstanding principal plus all accrued unpaid interest on August 7, 2026. In addition, Borrower will pay regular monthly payments of all accrued unpaid interest due as of each payment date, beginning September 7, 2024, with all subsequent interest payments to be due on the same day of each month after that. Unless otherwise agreed or required by applicable law, payments will be applied first to any accrued unpaid interest; then to principal; then to any escrow or reserve account payments as required under any mortgage, deed of trust, or other security instrument or security agreement securing this Note; then to any unpaid collection costs; and then to any late charges. Borrower will pay Lender at Lender’s address shown above or at such other place as Lender may designate in writing.**\n\n**INTEREST CALCULATION METHOD. Interest on this Note is computed on a 365/360 basis; that is, by applying the ratio of the interest rate over a year of 360 days, multiplied by the outstanding principal balance, multiplied by the actual number of days the principal balance is outstanding. All interest payable under this Note is computed using this method.**\n\n**PREPAYMENT.** Borrower agrees that all loan fees and other prepaid finance charges are earned fully as of the date of the loan and will not be subject to refund upon early payment (whether voluntary or as a result of default), except as otherwise required by law. Except for the foregoing, Borrower may pay without penalty all or a portion of the amount owed earlier than it is due. Early payments will not, unless agreed to by Lender in writing, relieve Borrower of Borrower’s obligation to continue to make payments of accrued unpaid interest. Rather, early payments will reduce the principal balance due. Borrower agrees not to send Lender payments marked “paid in full”, “without recourse”, or similar language. If Borrower sends such a payment, Lender may accept it without losing any of Lender’s rights under this Note, and Borrower will remain obligated to pay any further amount owed to Lender. **All written communications concerning disputed amounts, including any check or other payment instrument that indicates that the payment constitutes “payment in full” of the amount owed or that is tendered with other conditions or limitations or as full satisfaction of a disputed amount must be mailed or delivered to: Platinum Bank, Main Office, 7667 10th St N, Oakdale, MN 55128.**\n\n**LATE CHARGE.** If a payment is 11 days or more late, Borrower will be charged **5.000% of the unpaid portion of the regularly scheduled payment or $500.00, whichever is greater.**\n\n**INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT.** Upon default, including failure to pay upon final maturity, the interest rate on this Note shall be increased by 6.000 percentage points. However, in no event will the interest rate exceed the maximum interest rate limitations under applicable law.\n\n**DEFAULT.** Each of the following shall constitute an event of default (“Event of Default”) under this Note:\n\n**Payment Default.** Borrower fails to make any payment when due under this Note.\n\n**Other Defaults.** Borrower fails to comply with or to perform any other term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in this Note or in any of the related documents or to comply with or to perform any term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in any other agreement between Lender and Borrower.\n\n**Default in Favor of Third Parties.** Borrower or any Grantor defaults under any loan, extension of credit, security agreement, purchase or sales agreement, or any other agreement, in favor of any other creditor or person that may materially affect any of Borrower’s property or Borrower’s ability to repay this Note or perform Borrower’s obligations under this Note or any of the related documents.\n\n**False Statements.** Any warranty, representation or statement made or furnished to Lender by Borrower or on Borrower’s behalf under this Note or the related documents is false or misleading in any material respect, either now or at the time made or furnished or becomes false or misleading at any time thereafter.\n\n**Death or Insolvency.** The dissolution of Borrower (regardless of whether election to continue is made), any member withdraws from Borrower, or any other termination of Borrower’s existence as a going business or the death of any member, the insolvency of Borrower, the appointment of a receiver for any part of Borrower’s property, any assignment for the benefit of creditors, any type of creditor workout, or the commencement of any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws by or against Borrower.\n\n**Creditor or Forfeiture Proceedings.** Commencement of foreclosure or forfeiture proceedings, whether by judicial proceeding, self-help, repossession or any other method, by any creditor of Borrower or by any governmental agency against any collateral securing the loan. This includes a garnishment of any of Borrower’s accounts, including deposit accounts, with Lender. However, this Event of Default shall not apply if there is a good faith dispute by Borrower as to the validity or reasonableness of the claim which is the basis of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and if Borrower gives Lender written notice of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and deposits with Lender monies or a surety bond for the creditor or forfeiture proceeding, in an amount determined by Lender, in its sole discretion, as being an adequate reserve or bond for the dispute.\n\n**Events Affecting Guarantor.** Any of the preceding events occurs with respect to any Guarantor of any of the indebtedness or any Guarantor dies or becomes incompetent, or revokes or disputes the validity of, or liability under, any guaranty of the indebtedness evidenced by this Note.\n\n**Adverse Change.** A material adverse change occurs in Borrower’s financial condition, or Lender believes the prospect of payment or performance of this Note is impaired.\n\n**Cure Provisions.** If any default, other than a default in payment, is curable and if Borrower has not been given a notice of a breach of the same provision of this Note within the preceding twelve (12) months, it may be cured if Borrower, after Lender sends written notice to\n\n**Loan No: 5037422** |  **PROMISSORY NOTE** **(Continued)** | **Page 2**  \n---|---|---  \n  \nBorrower demanding cure of such default: (1) cures the default within ten (10) days; or (2) if the cure requires more than ten (10) days, immediately initiates steps which Lender deems in Lender’s sole discretion to be sufficient to cure the default and thereafter continues and completes all reasonable and necessary steps sufficient to produce compliance as soon as reasonably practical.\n\n**LENDER’S RIGHTS.** Upon default, Lender may declare the entire unpaid principal balance under this Note and all accrued unpaid interest immediately due, and then Borrower will pay that amount.\n\n**ATTORNEYS’ FEES; EXPENSES.** Lender may hire or pay someone else to help collect this Note if Borrower does not pay. Borrower will pay Lender that amount. This includes, subject to any limits under applicable law, Lender’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and Lender’s legal expenses, whether or not there is a lawsuit, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, expenses for bankruptcy proceedings (including efforts to modify or vacate any automatic stay or injunction), and appeals. If not prohibited by applicable law, Borrower also will pay any court costs, in addition to all other sums provided by law.\n\n**JURY WAIVER. Lender and Borrower hereby waive the right to any jury trial in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim brought by either Lender or Borrower against the other.**\n\n**GOVERNING LAW. This Note will be governed by federal law applicable to Lender and, to the extent not preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of Minnesota without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. This Note has been accepted by Lender in the State of Minnesota.**\n\n**DISHONORED ITEM FEE.** Borrower will pay a fee to Lender of $35.00 if Borrower makes a payment on Borrower’s loan and the check or preauthorized charge with which Borrower pays is later dishonored.\n\n**RIGHT OF SETOFF.** To the extent permitted by applicable law, Lender reserves a right of setoff in all Borrower’s accounts with Lender (whether checking, savings, or some other account). This includes all accounts Borrower holds jointly with someone else and all accounts Borrower may open in the future. However, this does not include any IRA or Keogh accounts, or any trust accounts for which setoff would be prohibited by law. Borrower authorizes Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to charge or setoff all sums owing on the indebtedness against any and all such accounts, and, at Lender’s option, to administratively freeze all such accounts to allow Lender to protect Lender’s charge and setoff rights provided in this paragraph.\n\n**COLLATERAL.** Borrower acknowledges this Note is secured by the following collateral described in the security instrument listed herein:\n\n(A) an Assignment of Deposit Account dated August 7, 2024 made and executed between MGO Global Inc and Lender on collateral described as:\n\nSavings Account Number with Lender with an approximate balance of $250,000.00\n\n**LINE OF CREDIT.** This Note evidences a revolving line of credit. Advances under this Note, as well as directions for payment from Borrower’s accounts, may be requested orally or in writing by Borrower or by an authorized person. Lender may, but need not, require that all oral requests be confirmed in writing.

The unpaid principal balance owing on this Note at any time may be evidenced by endorsements on this Note or by Lender’s internal records, including daily computer print-outs.\n\n**ANNUAL REVIEW.** Bank reserves the right to formally review the repayment ability of the borrower(s) and/or guarantor(s) at least annually. The borrower and/or guarantor acknowledges and agrees this review may include obtaining a consumer or business credit report to aid in the review.\n\n**PRIMARY DEPOSIT ACCOUNT.** Borrower agrees to maintain primary deposit account with Lender.\n\n**UNCONDITIONALLY CANCELLABLE COMMITMENT.** The unused portion of the commitment is unconditionally cancellable at any time by Lender. Lender, at is option, may prohibit additional extensions of credit, reduce the credit line, and terminate the commitment to the full extent permitted by relevant applicable law.\n\n**LOAN AGREEMENT.** Borrower acknowledges this loan is subject to a Loan Agreement dated as of even date herein.\n\n**GUARANTY.** Borrower acknowledges this loan is subject to the following guaranties:\n\n(A) unlimited, unsecured guaranty of MGO Global Inc. dated as of even date herein and all amendments, restatements, modifications and subsequent guarantees executed by Guarantor in favor of Lender.\n\n**SUCCESSOR INTERESTS.** The terms of this Note shall be binding upon Borrower, and upon Borrower’s heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of Lender and its successors and assigns.\n\n**NOTIFY US OF INACCURATE INFORMATION WE REPORT TO CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES.** Borrower may notify Lender if Lender reports any inaccurate information about Borrower’s account(s) to a consumer reporting agency.

This includes the execution of any document that should have been signed at or before the closing, re-execute any document signed at or before the closing and execute any document that was incorrectly or incompletely drafted and signed at the closing.\n\n**GENERAL PROVISIONS.** This Note is payable on demand. The inclusion of specific default provisions or rights of Lender shall not preclude Lender’s right to declare payment of this Note on its demand. If any part of this Note cannot be enforced, this fact will not affect the rest of the Note. Lender may delay or forgo enforcing any of its rights or remedies under this Note without losing them. In addition, Lender shall have all the rights and remedies provided in the related documents or available at law, in equity, or otherwise. Except as may be prohibited by applicable law, all of Lender’s rights and remedies shall be cumulative and may be exercised singularly or concurrently. Election by Lender to pursue any remedy shall not exclude pursuit of any other remedy, and an election to make expenditures or to take action to perform an obligation of Borrower shall not affect Lender’s right to declare a default and to exercise its rights and remedies. Borrower and any other person who signs, guarantees or endorses this Note, to the extent allowed by law, waive presentment, demand for payment, and notice of dishonor. Upon any change in the terms of this Note, and unless otherwise expressly stated in writing, no party who signs this Note, whether as maker, guarantor, accommodation maker or endorser, shall be released from liability. All such parties agree that Lender may renew or extend (repeatedly and for any length of time) this loan or release any party or guarantor or collateral; or impair, fail to realize upon or perfect Lender’s security interest in the collateral; and take any other action deemed necessary by Lender without the consent of or notice to anyone. All such parties also agree that Lender may modify this loan without the consent of or notice to anyone other than the party with whom the modification is made. The obligations under this Note are joint and several.\n\n**SECTION DISCLOSURE.** To the extent not preempted by federal law, this loan is made under Minnesota Statutes, Section 334.01.\n\n**Loan No: 5037422** | **PROMISSORY NOTE** **(Continued)** | **Page 3**  \n---|---|---  \n  \n**PRIOR TO SIGNING THIS NOTE, BORROWER READ AND UNDERSTOOD ALL THE PROVISIONS OF THIS NOTE.

Any inspections or tests made by Lender shall be at Borrower’s expense and for Lender’s purposes only and shall not be construed to create any responsibility or liability on the part of Lender to Borrower or to any other person. The representations and warranties contained herein are based on Borrower’s due diligence in investigating the Collateral for hazardous waste and Hazardous Substances.

Each insurance policy also shall include an endorsement providing that coverage in favor of Lender will not be impaired in any way by any act, omission or default of Borrower or any other person. In connection with all policies covering assets in which Lender holds or is offered a security interest for the Loans, Borrower will provide Lender with such lender’s loss payable or other endorsements as Lender may require.\n\n**Insurance Reports.** Furnish to Lender, upon request of Lender, reports on each existing insurance policy showing such information as Lender may reasonably request, including without limitation the following: (1) the name of the insurer; (2) the risks insured; (3) the amount of the policy; (4) the properties insured; (5) the then current property values on the basis of which insurance has been obtained, and the manner of determining those values; and (6) the expiration date of the policy.

Borrower may contest in good faith any such law, ordinance, or regulation and withhold compliance during any proceeding, including appropriate appeals, so long as Borrower has notified Lender in writing prior to doing so and so long as, in Lender’s sole opinion, Lender’s interests in the Collateral are not jeopardized. Lender may require Borrower to post adequate security or a surety bond, reasonably satisfactory to Lender, to protect Lender’s interest.\n\n**Beneficial Ownership Information.** Comply with all beneficial ownership information reporting requirements of the Corporate Transparency Act and its implementing regulations (collectively the CTA), if applicable to that Borrower. Any Borrower that is or becomes a reporting company as defined in the CTA: (1) has filed, or will file within required timeframes a complete and accurate report of its beneficial ownership information with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as required by the CTA; (2) will update or correct its beneficial ownership information with FinCEN within required timeframes upon any change in its beneficial ownership information; (3) will provide Lender with a copy of its beneficial ownership information report filed with FinCEN upon request; (4) consents to allow Lender to obtain from FinCEN beneficial ownership information filed by Borrower; and (5) will notify Lender in writing of any change in its beneficial ownership information within 30 days of such change.\n\n**Inspection.** Permit employees or agents of Lender at any reasonable time to inspect any and all Collateral for the Loan or Loans and Borrower’s other properties and to examine or audit Borrower’s books, accounts, and records and to make copies and memoranda of Borrower’s books, accounts, and records.

The Covenant Default Fee is in addition to and not a replacement for any other rights or remedies of Lender.\n\n**LENDER’S EXPENDITURES.** If any action or proceeding is commenced that would materially affect Lender’s interest in the Collateral or if Borrower fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement or any Related Documents, including but not limited to Borrower’s failure to discharge or pay when due any amounts Borrower is required to discharge or pay under this Agreement or any Related Documents, Lender on Borrower’s behalf may (but shall not be obligated to) take any action that Lender deems appropriate, including but not limited to discharging or paying all taxes, liens, security interests, encumbrances and other claims, at any time levied or placed on any Collateral and paying all costs for insuring, maintaining and preserving any Collateral. All such expenditures incurred or paid by Lender for such purposes will then bear interest at the rate charged under the Note from the date incurred or paid by Lender to the date of repayment by Borrower. All such expenses will become a part of the Indebtedness and, at Lender’s option, will (A) be payable on demand; (B) be added to the balance of the Note and be apportioned among and be payable with any installment payments to become due during either (1) the term of any applicable insurance policy; or (2) the remaining term of the Note; or (C) be treated as a balloon payment which will be due and payable at the Note’s maturity.\n\n**NEGATIVE COVENANTS.** Borrower covenants and agrees with Lender that while this Agreement is in effect, Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of Lender:\n\n**Indebtedness and Liens.** (1) Except for trade debt incurred in the normal course of business and indebtedness to Lender contemplated by this Agreement, create, incur or assume indebtedness for borrowed money, including finance leases, (2) sell, transfer, mortgage, assign, pledge, lease, grant a security interest in, or encumber any of Borrower’s assets (except as allowed as Permitted Liens), or (3) sell with recourse any of Borrower’s accounts receivable, except to Lender.\n\n**Continuity of Operations.** (1) Engage in any business activities substantially different than those in which Borrower is presently engaged, (2) cease operations, liquidate, merge or restructure as a legal entity (whether by division or otherwise), consolidate with or acquire any other entity, change its name, convert to another type of entity or redomesticate, dissolve or transfer or sell Collateral out of the ordinary course of business, or (3) make any distribution with respect to any capital account, whether by reduction of capital or otherwise.\n\n**Loans, Acquisitions and Guaranties.** (1) Loan, invest in or advance money or assets to any other person, enterprise or entity, (2) purchase, create or acquire any interest in any other enterprise or entity, or (3) incur any obligation as surety or guarantor other than in the ordinary course of business.\n\n**Agreements.** Enter into any agreement containing any provisions which would be violated or breached by the performance of Borrower’s obligations under this Agreement or in connection herewith.\n\n**Loan No: 5037422**| **BUSINESS LOAN AGREEMENT****(Continued)**| **Page 4**  \n---|---|---  \n  \n**CESSATION OF ADVANCES.** If Lender has made any commitment to make any Loan to Borrower, whether under this Agreement or under any other agreement, Lender shall have no obligation to make Loan Advances or to disburse Loan proceeds if: (A) Borrower or any Guarantor is in default under the terms of this Agreement or any of the Related Documents or any other agreement that Borrower or any Guarantor has with Lender; (B) Borrower or any Guarantor dies, becomes incompetent or becomes insolvent, files a petition in bankruptcy or similar proceedings, or is adjudged a bankrupt; (C) there occurs a material adverse change in Borrower’s financial condition, in the financial condition of any Guarantor, or in the value of any Collateral securing any Loan; or (D) any Guarantor seeks, claims or otherwise attempts to limit, modify or revoke such Guarantor’s guaranty of the Loan or any other loan with Lender.\n\n**RIGHT OF SETOFF.** To the extent permitted by applicable law, Lender reserves a right of setoff in all Borrower’s accounts with Lender (whether checking, savings, or some other account). This includes all accounts Borrower holds jointly with someone else and all accounts Borrower may open in the future. However, this does not include any IRA or Keogh accounts, or any trust accounts for which setoff would be prohibited by law. Borrower authorizes Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to charge or setoff all sums owing on the Indebtedness against any and all such accounts, and, at Lender’s option, to administratively freeze all such accounts to allow Lender to protect Lender’s charge and setoff rights provided in this paragraph.\n\n**DEFAULT.** Each of the following shall constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement:\n\n**Payment Default.** Borrower fails to make any payment when due under the Loan.\n\n**Other Defaults.** Borrower fails to comply with or to perform any other term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or in any of the Related Documents or to comply with or to perform any term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in any other agreement between Lender and Borrower.\n\n**Default in Favor of Third Parties.** Borrower or any Grantor defaults under any loan, extension of credit, security agreement, purchase or sales agreement, or any other agreement, in favor of any other creditor or person that may materially affect any of Borrower’s or any Grantor’s property or Borrower’s or any Grantor’s ability to repay the Loans or perform their respective obligations under this Agreement or any of the Related Documents.\n\n**False Statements.** Any warranty, representation or statement made or furnished to Lender by Borrower or on Borrower’s behalf under this Agreement or the Related Documents is false or misleading in any material respect, either now or at the time made or furnished or becomes false or misleading at any time thereafter.\n\n**Death or Insolvency.** The dissolution of Borrower (regardless of whether election to continue is made), any member withdraws from Borrower, or any other termination of Borrower’s existence as a going business or the death of any member, the insolvency of Borrower, the appointment of a receiver for any part of Borrower’s property, any assignment for the benefit of creditors, any type of creditor workout, or the commencement of any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws by or against Borrower.\n\n**Defective Collateralization.** This Agreement or any of the Related Documents ceases to be in full force and effect (including failure of any collateral document to create a valid and perfected security interest or lien) at any time and for any reason.\n\n**Creditor or Forfeiture Proceedings.** Commencement of foreclosure or forfeiture proceedings, whether by judicial proceeding, self-help, repossession or any other method, by any creditor of Borrower or by any governmental agency against any collateral securing the Loan. This includes a garnishment of any of Borrower’s accounts, including deposit accounts, with Lender. However, this Event of Default shall not apply if there is a good faith dispute by Borrower as to the validity or reasonableness of the claim which is the basis of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and if Borrower gives Lender written notice of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and deposits with Lender monies or a surety bond for the creditor or forfeiture proceeding, in an amount determined by Lender, in its sole discretion, as being an adequate reserve or bond for the dispute.\n\n**Events Affecting Guarantor.** Any of the preceding events occurs with respect to any Guarantor of any of the Indebtedness or any Guarantor dies or becomes incompetent, or revokes or disputes the validity of, or liability under, any Guaranty of the Indebtedness.\n\n**Adverse Change.** A material adverse change occurs in Borrower’s financial condition, or Lender believes the prospect of payment or performance of the Loan is impaired.\n\n**Right to Cure.** If any default, other than a default on Indebtedness, is curable and if Borrower or Grantor, as the case may be, has not been given a notice of a similar default within the preceding twelve (12) months, it may be cured if Borrower or Grantor, as the case may be, after Lender sends written notice to Borrower or Grantor, as the case may be, demanding cure of such default: (1) cure the default within ten (10) days; or (2) if the cure requires more than ten (10) days, immediately initiate steps which Lender deems in Lender’s sole discretion to be sufficient to cure the default and thereafter continue and complete all reasonable and necessary steps sufficient to produce compliance as soon as reasonably practical.\n\n**EFFECT OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT.** If any Event of Default shall occur, except where otherwise provided in this Agreement or the Related Documents, all commitments and obligations of Lender under this Agreement or the Related Documents or any other agreement immediately will terminate (including any obligation to make further Loan Advances or disbursements), and, at Lender’s option, all Indebtedness immediately will become due and payable, all without notice of any kind to Borrower, except that in the case of an Event of Default of the type described in the “Insolvency” subsection above, such acceleration shall be automatic and not optional. In addition, Lender shall have all the rights and remedies provided in the Related Documents or available at law, in equity, or otherwise. Except as may be prohibited by applicable law, all of Lender’s rights and remedies shall be cumulative and may be exercised singularly or concurrently. Election by Lender to pursue any remedy shall not exclude pursuit of any other remedy, and an election to make expenditures or to take action to perform an obligation of Borrower or of any Grantor shall not affect Lender’s right to declare a default and to exercise its rights and remedies.\n\n**MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.** The following miscellaneous provisions are a part of this Agreement:\n\n**Amendments.** This Agreement, together with any Related Documents, constitutes the entire understanding and agreement of the parties as to the matters set forth in this Agreement. No alteration of or amendment to this Agreement shall be effective unless given in writing and signed by the party or parties sought to be charged or bound by the alteration or amendment.\n\n**Attorneys’ Fees; Expenses.** Borrower agrees to pay upon demand all of Lender’s costs and expenses, including Lender’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and Lender’s legal expenses, incurred in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement. Lender may hire or pay someone else to help enforce this Agreement, and Borrower shall pay the costs and expenses of such enforcement. Costs and expenses include Lender’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and legal expenses whether or not there is a lawsuit, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and legal expenses for bankruptcy proceedings (including efforts to modify or vacate any automatic stay or injunction), appeals, and any anticipated post-judgment collection services. Borrower also shall pay all court costs and such additional fees as may be directed by the court.\n\n**Loan No: 5037422**| **BUSINESS LOAN AGREEMENT****(Continued)**| **Page 5**  \n---|---|---  \n  \n**Caption Headings.** Caption headings in this Agreement are for convenience purposes only and are not to be used to interpret or define the provisions of this Agreement.\n\n**Consent to Loan Participation.** Borrower agrees and consents to Lender’s sale or transfer, whether now or later, of one or more participation interests in the Loan to one or more purchasers, whether related or unrelated to Lender. Lender may provide, without any limitation whatsoever, to any one or more purchasers, or potential purchasers, any information or knowledge Lender may have about Borrower or about any other matter relating to the Loan, and Borrower hereby waives any rights to privacy Borrower may have with respect to such matters. Borrower additionally waives any and all notices of sale of participation interests, as well as all notices of any repurchase of such participation interests. Borrower also agrees that the purchasers of any such participation interests will be considered as the absolute owners of such interests in the Loan and will have all the rights granted under the participation agreement or agreements governing the sale of such participation interests. Borrower further waives all rights of offset or counterclaim that it may have now or later against Lender or against any purchaser of such a participation interest and unconditionally agrees that either Lender or such purchaser may enforce Borrower’s obligation under the Loan irrespective of the failure or insolvency of any holder of any interest in the Loan. Borrower further agrees that the purchaser of any such participation interests may enforce its interests irrespective of any personal claims or defenses that Borrower may have against Lender.\n\n**Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by federal law applicable to Lender and, to the extent not preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of Minnesota without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. This Agreement has been accepted by Lender in the State of Minnesota.**\n\n**No Waiver by Lender.** Lender shall not be deemed to have waived any rights under this Agreement unless such waiver is given in writing and signed by Lender. No delay or omission on the part of Lender in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver of such right or any other right. A waiver by Lender of a provision of this Agreement shall not prejudice or constitute a waiver of Lender’s right otherwise to demand strict compliance with that provision or any other provision of this Agreement. No prior waiver by Lender, nor any course of dealing between Lender and Borrower, or between Lender and any Grantor, shall constitute a waiver of any of Lender’s rights or of any of Borrower’s or any Grantor’s obligations as to any future transactions. Whenever the consent of Lender is required under this Agreement, the granting of such consent by Lender in any instance shall not constitute continuing consent to subsequent instances where such consent is required and in all cases such consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of Lender.\n\n**Notices.** Any notice required to be given under this Agreement shall be given in writing, and shall be effective when actually delivered, when actually received by telefacsimile (unless otherwise required by law), when deposited with a nationally recognized overnight courier, or, if mailed, when deposited in the United States mail, as first class, certified or registered mail postage prepaid, directed to the addresses shown near the beginning of this Agreement. Any party may change its address for notices under this Agreement by giving formal written notice to the other parties, specifying that the purpose of the notice is to change the party’s address. For notice purposes, Borrower agrees to keep Lender informed at all times of Borrower’s current address. Unless otherwise provided or required by law, if there is more than one Borrower, any notice given by Lender to any Borrower is deemed to be notice given to all Borrowers.\n\n**Severability.** If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable as to any circumstance, that finding shall not make the offending provision illegal, invalid, or unenforceable as to any other circumstance. If feasible, the offending provision shall be considered modified so that it becomes legal, valid and enforceable. If the offending provision cannot be so modified, it shall be considered deleted from this Agreement. Unless otherwise required by law, the illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement.\n\n**Subsidiaries and Affiliates of Borrower.** To the extent the context of any provisions of this Agreement makes it appropriate, including without limitation any representation, warranty or covenant, the word “Borrower” as used in this Agreement shall include all of Borrower’s subsidiaries and affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing however, under no circumstances shall this Agreement be construed to require Lender to make any Loan or other financial accommodation to any of Borrower’s subsidiaries or affiliates.\n\n**Successors and Assigns.** All covenants and agreements by or on behalf of Borrower contained in this Agreement or any Related Documents shall bind Borrower’s successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of Lender and its successors and assigns. Borrower shall not, however, have the right to assign Borrower’s rights under this Agreement or any interest therein, without the prior written consent of Lender.\n\n**Survival of Representations and Warranties.** Borrower understands and agrees that in extending Loan Advances, Lender is relying on all representations, warranties, and covenants made by Borrower in this Agreement or in any certificate or other instrument delivered by Borrower to Lender under this Agreement or the Related Documents. Borrower further agrees that regardless of any investigation made by Lender, all such representations, warranties and covenants will survive the extension of Loan Advances and delivery to Lender of the Related Documents, shall be continuing in nature, shall be deemed made and redated by Borrower at the time each Loan Advance is made, and shall remain in full force and effect until such time as Borrower’s Indebtedness shall be paid in full, or until this Agreement shall be terminated in the manner provided above, whichever is the last to occur.\n\n**Time is of the Essence.** Time is of the essence in the performance of this Agreement.\n\n**Waive Jury. All parties to this Agreement hereby waive the right to any jury trial in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim brought by any party against any other party.**\n\n**Errors and Omissions.** Upon the request of Lender, Borrower agrees to fully cooperate to correct any clerical errors and/or omissions in loan documents, including but not limited to the Note, guaranties, collateral, and any other Related Documents.

Lauderdale, FL 33304** | **7667 10th St N**  \n**Oakdale, MN 55128**  \n**Guarantor:** | **MGO Global Inc**  \n**813 NE 17th Terr Unit A**  \n**Ft. Lauderdale, FL 33304**  \n  \n**CONTINUING GUARANTEE OF PAYMENT AND PERFORMANCE.** For good and valuable consideration, Guarantor absolutely and unconditionally guarantees full and punctual payment and satisfaction of the Indebtedness of Borrower to Lender, and the performance and discharge of all Borrower’s obligations under the Note and the Related Documents. This is a guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection, so Lender can enforce this Guaranty against Guarantor even when Lender has not exhausted Lender’s remedies against anyone else obligated to pay the Indebtedness or against any collateral securing the Indebtedness, this Guaranty or any other guaranty of the Indebtedness. Guarantor will make any payments to Lender or its order, on demand, in legal tender of the United States of America, in same-day funds, without set-off or deduction or counterclaim, and will otherwise perform Borrower’s obligations under the Note and Related Documents. Under this Guaranty, Guarantor’s liability is unlimited and Guarantor’s obligations are continuing.\n\n**INDEBTEDNESS.** The word “Indebtedness” as used in this Guaranty means all of the principal amount outstanding from time to time and at any one or more times, accrued unpaid interest thereon and all collection costs and legal expenses related thereto permitted by law, reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising from any and all debts, liabilities and obligations of every nature or form, now existing or hereafter arising or acquired, that Borrower individually or collectively or interchangeably with others, owes or will owe Lender. “Indebtedness” includes, without limitation, loans, advances, debts, overdraft indebtedness, credit card indebtedness, lease obligations, liabilities and obligations under any interest rate protection agreements or foreign currency exchange agreements or commodity price protection agreements, other obligations, and liabilities of Borrower, and any present or future judgments against Borrower, future advances, loans or transactions that renew, extend, modify, refinance, consolidate or substitute these debts, liabilities and obligations whether: voluntarily or involuntarily incurred; due or to become due by their terms or acceleration; absolute or contingent; liquidated or unliquidated; determined or undetermined; direct or indirect; primary or secondary in nature or arising from a guaranty or surety; secured or unsecured; joint or several or joint and several; evidenced by a negotiable or non-negotiable instrument or writing; originated by Lender or another or others; barred or unenforceable against Borrower for any reason whatsoever; for any transactions that may be voidable for any reason (such as infancy, insanity, ultra vires or otherwise); and originated then reduced or extinguished and then afterwards increased or reinstated.\n\nIf Lender presently holds one or more guaranties, or hereafter receives additional guaranties from Guarantor, Lender’s rights under all guaranties shall be cumulative. This Guaranty shall not (unless specifically provided below to the contrary) affect or invalidate any such other guaranties. Guarantor’s liability will be Guarantor’s aggregate liability under the terms of this Guaranty and any such other unterminated guaranties.\n\n**CONTINUING GUARANTY.** THIS IS A “CONTINUING GUARANTY” UNDER WHICH GUARANTOR AGREES TO GUARANTEE THE FULL AND PUNCTUAL PAYMENT, PERFORMANCE AND SATISFACTION OF THE INDEBTEDNESS OF BORROWER TO LENDER, NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING OR ACQUIRED, ON AN OPEN AND CONTINUING BASIS. ACCORDINGLY, ANY PAYMENTS MADE ON THE INDEBTEDNESS WILL NOT DISCHARGE OR DIMINISH GUARANTOR’S OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITY UNDER THIS GUARANTY FOR ANY REMAINING AND SUCCEEDING INDEBTEDNESS EVEN WHEN ALL OR PART OF THE OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS MAY BE A ZERO BALANCE FROM TIME TO TIME.\n\n**DURATION OF GUARANTY.** This Guaranty will take effect when received by Lender without the necessity of any acceptance by Lender, or any notice to Guarantor or to Borrower, and will continue in full force until all the Indebtedness incurred or contracted before receipt by Lender of any notice of revocation shall have been fully and finally paid and satisfied and all of Guarantor’s other obligations under this Guaranty shall have been performed in full. If Guarantor elects to revoke this Guaranty, Guarantor may only do so in writing. Guarantor’s written notice of revocation must be mailed to Lender, by certified mail, at Lender’s address listed above or such other place as Lender may designate in writing. Written revocation of this Guaranty will apply only to new Indebtedness created after actual receipt by Lender of Guarantor’s written revocation. For this purpose and without limitation, the term “new Indebtedness” does not include the Indebtedness which at the time of notice of revocation is contingent, unliquidated, undetermined or not due and which later becomes absolute, liquidated, determined or due. For this purpose and without limitation, “new Indebtedness” does not include all or part of the Indebtedness that is: incurred by Borrower prior to revocation; incurred under a commitment that became binding before revocation; any renewals, extensions, substitutions, and modifications of the Indebtedness. This Guaranty shall bind Guarantor’s estate as to the Indebtedness created both before and after Guarantor’s death or incapacity, regardless of Lender’s actual notice of Guarantor’s death. Subject to the foregoing, Guarantor’s executor or administrator or other legal representative may terminate this Guaranty in the same manner in which Guarantor might have terminated it and with the same effect. Release of any other guarantor or termination of any other guaranty of the Indebtedness shall not affect the liability of Guarantor under this Guaranty. A revocation Lender receives from any one or more Guarantors shall not affect the liability of any remaining Guarantors under this Guaranty. **It is anticipated that fluctuations may occur in the aggregate amount of the Indebtedness covered by this Guaranty, and Guarantor specifically acknowledges and agrees that reductions in the amount of the Indebtedness, even to zero dollars ($0.00), shall not constitute a termination of this Guaranty. This Guaranty is binding upon Guarantor and Guarantor’s heirs, successors and assigns so long as any of the Indebtedness remains unpaid and even though the Indebtedness may from time to time be zero dollars ($0.00).**\n\n**GUARANTOR’S AUTHORIZATION TO LENDER.** Guarantor authorizes Lender, either before or after any revocation hereof, **without notice or demand and without lessening Guarantor’s liability under this Guaranty, from time to time:** (A) prior to revocation as set forth above, to make one or more additional secured or unsecured loans to Borrower, to lease equipment or other goods to Borrower, or otherwise to extend additional credit to Borrower; (B) to alter, compromise, renew, extend, accelerate, or otherwise change one or more times the time for payment or other terms of the Indebtedness or any part of the Indebtedness, including increases and decreases of the rate of interest on the Indebtedness; extensions may be repeated and may be for longer than the original loan term; (C) to take and hold security for the payment of this Guaranty or the Indebtedness, and exchange, enforce, waive, subordinate, fail or decide not to perfect, and release any such security, with or without the substitution of new collateral; (D) to release, substitute, agree not to sue, or deal with any one or more of Borrower’s sureties, endorsers, or other guarantors on any terms or in any manner Lender may choose; (E) to determine how, when and what application of payments and credits shall be made on the Indebtedness; (F) to apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof, including without limitation, any nonjudicial sale permitted by the terms of the controlling security agreement or deed of trust, as Lender in its discretion may determine; (G) to sell, transfer, assign or grant participations in all or any part of the Indebtedness; and (H) to assign or transfer this Guaranty in whole or in part.\n\n**COMMERCIAL GUARANTY****(Continued)**| **Page 2**  \n---|---  \n  \n**GUARANTOR’S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.** Guarantor represents and warrants to Lender that (A) no representations or agreements of any kind have been made to Guarantor which would limit or qualify in any way the terms of this Guaranty; (B) this Guaranty is executed at Borrower’s request and not at the request of Lender; (C) Guarantor has full power, right and authority to enter into this Guaranty; (D) the provisions of this Guaranty do not conflict with or result in a default under any agreement or other instrument binding upon Guarantor and do not result in a violation of any law, regulation, court decree or order applicable to Guarantor; (E) Guarantor has not and will not, without the prior written consent of Lender, sell, lease, assign, encumber, hypothecate, transfer, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of Guarantor’s assets, or any interest therein; (F) upon Lender’s request, Guarantor will provide to Lender financial and credit information in form acceptable to Lender, and all such financial information which currently has been, and all future financial information which will be provided to Lender is and will be true and correct in all material respects and fairly present Guarantor’s financial condition as of the dates the financial information is provided; (G) no material adverse change has occurred in Guarantor’s financial condition since the date of the most recent financial statements provided to Lender and no event has occurred which may materially adversely affect Guarantor’s financial condition; (H) no litigation, claim, investigation, administrative proceeding or similar action (including those for unpaid taxes) against Guarantor is pending or threatened; (I) Lender has made no representation to Guarantor as to the creditworthiness of Borrower; and (J) Guarantor has established adequate means of obtaining from Borrower on a continuing basis information regarding Borrower’s financial condition. Guarantor agrees to keep adequately informed from such means of any facts, events, or circumstances which might in any way affect Guarantor’s risks under this Guaranty, and Guarantor further agrees that, absent a request for information, Lender shall have no obligation to disclose to Guarantor any information or documents acquired by Lender in the course of its relationship with Borrower.\n\n**GUARANTOR’S WAIVERS.** Except as prohibited by applicable law, Guarantor waives any right to require Lender (A) to continue lending money or to extend other credit to Borrower; (B) to make any presentment, protest, demand, or notice of any kind, including notice of any nonpayment of the Indebtedness or of any nonpayment related to any collateral, or notice of any action or nonaction on the part of Borrower, Lender, any surety, endorser, or other guarantor in connection with the Indebtedness or in connection with the creation of new or additional loans or obligations; (C) to resort for payment or to proceed directly or at once against any person, including Borrower or any other guarantor; (D) to proceed directly against or exhaust any collateral held by Lender from Borrower, any other guarantor, or any other person; (E) to give notice of the terms, time, and place of any public or private sale of personal property security held by Lender from Borrower or to comply with any other applicable provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code; (F) to pursue any other remedy within Lender’s power; or (G) to commit any act or omission of any kind, or at any time, with respect to any matter whatsoever.\n\nGuarantor also waives any and all rights or defenses based on suretyship or impairment of collateral including, but not limited to, any rights or defenses arising by reason of (A) any “one action” or “anti-deficiency” law or any other law which may prevent Lender from bringing any action, including a claim for deficiency, against Guarantor, before or after Lender’s commencement or completion of any foreclosure action, either judicially or by exercise of a power of sale; (B) any election of remedies by Lender which destroys or otherwise adversely affects Guarantor’s subrogation rights or Guarantor’s rights to proceed against Borrower for reimbursement, including without limitation, any loss of rights Guarantor may suffer by reason of any law limiting, qualifying, or discharging the Indebtedness; (C) any disability or other defense of Borrower, of any other guarantor, or of any other person, or by reason of the cessation of Borrower’s liability from any cause whatsoever, other than payment in full in legal tender, of the Indebtedness; (D) any right to claim discharge of the Indebtedness on the basis of unjustified impairment of any collateral for the Indebtedness; (E) any statute of limitations, if at any time any action or suit brought by Lender against Guarantor is commenced, there is outstanding Indebtedness which is not barred by any applicable statute of limitations; or (F) any defenses given to guarantors at law or in equity other than actual payment and performance of the Indebtedness. If payment is made by Borrower, whether voluntarily or otherwise, or by any third party, on the Indebtedness and thereafter Lender is forced to remit the amount of that payment to Borrower’s trustee in bankruptcy or to any similar person under any federal or state bankruptcy law or law for the relief of debtors, the Indebtedness shall be considered unpaid for the purpose of the enforcement of this Guaranty.\n\nGuarantor further waives and agrees not to assert or claim at any time any deductions to the amount guaranteed under this Guaranty for any claim of setoff, counterclaim, counter demand, recoupment or similar right, whether such claim, demand or right may be asserted by the Borrower, the Guarantor, or both.\n\n**GUARANTOR’S UNDERSTANDING WITH RESPECT TO WAIVERS.** Guarantor warrants and agrees that each of the waivers set forth above is made with Guarantor’s full knowledge of its significance and consequences and that, under the circumstances, the waivers are reasonable and not contrary to public policy or law. If any such waiver is determined to be contrary to any applicable law or public policy, such waiver shall be effective only to the extent permitted by law or public policy.\n\n**RIGHT OF SETOFF.** To the extent permitted by applicable law, Lender reserves a right of setoff in all Guarantor’s accounts with Lender (whether checking, savings, or some other account). This includes all accounts Guarantor holds jointly with someone else and all accounts Guarantor may open in the future. However, this does not include any IRA or Keogh accounts, or any trust accounts for which setoff would be prohibited by law. Guarantor authorizes Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to hold these funds if there is a default, and Lender may apply the funds in these accounts to pay what Guarantor owes under the terms of this Guaranty.\n\n**SUBORDINATION OF BORROWER’S DEBTS TO GUARANTOR.** Guarantor agrees that the Indebtedness, whether now existing or hereafter created, shall be superior to any claim that Guarantor may now have or hereafter acquire against Borrower, whether or not Borrower becomes insolvent. Guarantor hereby expressly subordinates any claim Guarantor may have against Borrower, upon any account whatsoever, to any claim that Lender may now or hereafter have against Borrower. In the event of insolvency and consequent liquidation of the assets of Borrower, through bankruptcy, by an assignment for the benefit of creditors, by voluntary liquidation, or otherwise, the assets of Borrower applicable to the payment of the claims of both Lender and Guarantor shall be paid to Lender and shall be first applied by Lender to the Indebtedness. Guarantor does hereby assign to Lender all claims which it may have or acquire against Borrower or against any assignee or trustee in bankruptcy of Borrower; provided however, that such assignment shall be effective only for the purpose of assuring to Lender full payment in legal tender of the Indebtedness. If Lender so requests, any notes or credit agreements now or hereafter evidencing any debts or obligations of Borrower to Guarantor shall be marked with a legend that the same are subject to this Guaranty and shall be delivered to Lender. Guarantor agrees, and Lender is hereby authorized, in the name of Guarantor, from time to time to file financing statements and continuation statements and to execute documents and to take such other actions as Lender deems necessary or appropriate to perfect, preserve and enforce its rights under this Guaranty.\n\n**MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.** The following miscellaneous provisions are a part of this Guaranty:\n\n**Amendments.** This Guaranty, together with any Related Documents, constitutes the entire understanding and agreement of the parties as to the matters set forth in this Guaranty. No alteration of or amendment to this Guaranty shall be effective unless given in writing and signed by the party or parties sought to be charged or bound by the alteration or amendment.\n\n**Attorneys’ Fees; Expenses.** Guarantor agrees to pay upon demand all of Lender’s costs and expenses, including Lender’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and Lender’s legal expenses, incurred in connection with the enforcement of this Guaranty. Lender may hire or pay someone else to help enforce this Guaranty, and Guarantor shall pay the costs and expenses of such enforcement. Costs and expenses include Lender’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and legal expenses whether or not there is a lawsuit, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and legal expenses for bankruptcy proceedings (including efforts to modify or vacate any automatic stay or injunction), appeals, and any anticipated post-judgment collection services. Guarantor also shall pay all court costs and such additional fees as may be directed by the court.\n\n**COMMERCIAL GUARANTY****(Continued)**| **Page 3**  \n---|---  \n  \n**Caption Headings.** Caption headings in this Guaranty are for convenience purposes only and are not to be used to interpret or define the provisions of this Guaranty.\n\n**Governing Law. This Guaranty will be governed by federal law applicable to Lender and, to the extent not preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of Minnesota without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.**\n\n**Integration.** Guarantor further agrees that Guarantor has read and fully understands the terms of this Guaranty; Guarantor has had the opportunity to be advised by Guarantor’s attorney with respect to this Guaranty; the Guaranty fully reflects Guarantor’s intentions and parol evidence is not required to interpret the terms of this Guaranty. Guarantor hereby indemnifies and holds Lender harmless from all losses, claims, damages, and costs (including Lender’s attorneys’ fees) suffered or incurred by Lender as a result of any breach by Guarantor of the warranties, representations and agreements of this paragraph.\n\n**Interpretation.** In all cases where there is more than one Borrower or Guarantor, then all words used in this Guaranty in the singular shall be deemed to have been used in the plural where the context and construction so require; and where there is more than one Borrower named in this Guaranty or when this Guaranty is executed by more than one Guarantor, the words “Borrower” and “Guarantor” respectively shall mean all and any one or more of them. The words “Guarantor,” “Borrower,” and “Lender” include the heirs, successors, assigns, and transferees of each of them. If a court finds that any provision of this Guaranty is not valid or should not be enforced, that fact by itself will not mean that the rest of this Guaranty will not be valid or enforced. Therefore, a court will enforce the rest of the provisions of this Guaranty even if a provision of this Guaranty may be found to be invalid or unenforceable. If any one or more of Borrower or Guarantor are corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies, or similar entities, it is not necessary for Lender to inquire into the powers of Borrower or Guarantor or of the officers, directors, partners, managers, or other agents acting or purporting to act on their behalf, and any indebtedness made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed under this Guaranty.\n\n**Notices.** Any notice required to be given under this Guaranty shall be given in writing, and, except for revocation notices by Guarantor, shall be effective when actually delivered, when actually received by telefacsimile (unless otherwise required by law), when deposited with a nationally recognized overnight courier, or, if mailed, when deposited in the United States mail, as first class, certified or registered mail postage prepaid, directed to the addresses shown near the beginning of this Guaranty. All revocation notices by Guarantor shall be in writing and shall be effective upon delivery to Lender as provided in the section of this Guaranty entitled “DURATION OF GUARANTY.” Any party may change its address for notices under this Guaranty by giving formal written notice to the other parties, specifying that the purpose of the notice is to change the party’s address. For notice purposes, Guarantor agrees to keep Lender informed at all times of Guarantor’s current address. Unless otherwise provided or required by law, if there is more than one Guarantor, any notice given by Lender to any Guarantor is deemed to be notice given to all Guarantors.\n\n**No Waiver by Lender.** Lender shall not be deemed to have waived any rights under this Guaranty unless such waiver is given in writing and signed by Lender. No delay or omission on the part of Lender in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver of such right or any other right. A waiver by Lender of a provision of this Guaranty shall not prejudice or constitute a waiver of Lender’s right otherwise to demand strict compliance with that provision or any other provision of this Guaranty. No prior waiver by Lender, nor any course of dealing between Lender and Guarantor, shall constitute a waiver of any of Lender’s rights or of any of Guarantor’s obligations as to any future transactions. Whenever the consent of Lender is required under this Guaranty, the granting of such consent by Lender in any instance shall not constitute continuing consent to subsequent instances where such consent is required and in all cases such consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of Lender.\n\n**Successors and Assigns.** Subject to any limitations stated in this Guaranty on transfer of Guarantor’s interest, this Guaranty shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and assigns.\n\n**Waive Jury. Lender and Guarantor hereby waive the right to any jury trial in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim brought by either Lender or Guarantor against the other.**\n\n**DEFINITIONS.** The following capitalized words and terms shall have the following meanings when used in this Guaranty. Unless specifically stated to the contrary, all references to dollar amounts shall mean amounts in lawful money of the United States of America.

Lauderdale, FL 33304**  \n  \n**THIS ASSIGNMENT OF DEPOSIT ACCOUNT dated August 7, 2024, is made and executed among MGO Global Inc (“Grantor”); Americana Liberty LLC (“Borrower”); and Platinum Bank (“Lender”).**\n\n**ASSIGNMENT.** For valuable consideration, Grantor assigns and grants to Lender a security interest in the Collateral, including without limitation the deposit account(s) described below, to secure the Indebtedness and agrees that Lender shall have the rights stated in this Agreement with respect to the Collateral, in addition to all other rights which Lender may have by law.\n\n**COLLATERAL DESCRIPTION.** The word “Collateral” means the following described deposit account(s) (“Account”):\n\n**Savings Account Number** **with Lender with an approximate balance of $250,000.00** together with (A) all interest, whether now accrued or hereafter accruing; (B) all additional deposits hereafter made to the Account; (C) any and all proceeds from the Account; and (D) all renewals, replacements and substitutions for any of the foregoing.\n\n**CROSS-COLLATERALIZATION.** In addition to the Note, this Agreement secures all obligations, debts and liabilities, plus interest thereon, of either Grantor or Borrower to Lender, or any one or more of them, as well as all claims by Lender against Borrower and Grantor or any one or more of them, whether now existing or hereafter arising, whether related or unrelated to the purpose of the Note, whether voluntary or otherwise, whether due or not due, direct or indirect, determined or undetermined, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, whether Borrower or Grantor may be liable individually or jointly with others, whether obligated as guarantor, surety, accommodation party or otherwise, and whether recovery upon such amounts may be or hereafter may become barred by any statute of limitations, and whether the obligation to repay such amounts may be or hereafter may become otherwise unenforceable.\n\n**BORROWER’S WAIVERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES.** Except as otherwise required under this Agreement or by applicable law, (A) Borrower agrees that Lender need not tell Borrower about any action or inaction Lender takes in connection with this Agreement; (B) Borrower assumes the responsibility for being and keeping informed about the Collateral; and (C) Borrower waives any defenses that may arise because of any action or inaction of Lender, including without limitation any failure of Lender to realize upon the Collateral or any delay by Lender in realizing upon the Collateral; and Borrower agrees to remain liable under the Note no matter what action Lender takes or fails to take under this Agreement.\n\n**GRANTOR’S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.** Grantor warrants that: (A) this Agreement is executed at Borrower’s request and not at the request of Lender; (B) Grantor has the full right, power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to pledge the Collateral to Lender; (C) Grantor has established adequate means of obtaining from Borrower on a continuing basis information about Borrower’s financial condition; and (D) Lender has made no representation to Grantor about Borrower or Borrower’s creditworthiness.\n\n**GRANTOR’S WAIVERS.** Grantor waives all requirements of presentment, protest, demand, and notice of dishonor or non-payment to Borrower or Grantor, or any other party to the Indebtedness or the Collateral. Lender may do any of the following with respect to any obligation of any Borrower, without first obtaining the consent of Grantor: (A) grant any extension of time for any payment, (B) grant any renewal, (C) permit any modification of payment terms or other terms, or (D) exchange or release any Collateral or other security. No such act or failure to act shall affect Lender’s rights against Grantor or the Collateral.\n\n**RIGHT OF SETOFF.** To the extent permitted by applicable law, Lender reserves a right of setoff in all Grantor’s accounts with Lender (whether checking, savings, or some other account). This includes all accounts Grantor holds jointly with someone else and all accounts Grantor may open in the future. However, this does not include any IRA or Keogh accounts, or any trust accounts for which setoff would be prohibited by law. Grantor authorizes Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to charge or setoff all sums owing on the Indebtedness against any and all such accounts, and, at Lender’s option, to administratively freeze all such accounts to allow Lender to protect Lender’s charge and setoff rights provided in this paragraph.\n\n**GRANTOR’S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLATERAL.** With respect to the Collateral, Grantor represents and promises to Lender that:\n\n**Ownership.** Grantor is the lawful owner of the Collateral free and clear of all loans, liens, encumbrances, and claims except as disclosed to and accepted by Lender in writing.\n\n**Right to Grant Security Interest.** Grantor has the full right, power, and authority to enter into this Agreement and to assign the Collateral to Lender.\n\n**No Prior Assignment.** Grantor has not previously granted a security interest in the Collateral to any other creditor.\n\n**No Further Transfer.** Grantor shall not sell, assign, encumber, or otherwise dispose of any of Grantor’s rights in the Collateral except as provided in this Agreement.\n\n**No Defaults.** There are no defaults relating to the Collateral, and there are no offsets or counterclaims to the same. Grantor will strictly and promptly do everything required of Grantor under the terms, conditions, promises, and agreements contained in or relating to the Collateral.\n\n**Proceeds.** Any and all replacement or renewal certificates, instruments, or other benefits or proceeds related to the Collateral that are received by Grantor shall be held by Grantor in trust for Lender and immediately shall be delivered by Grantor to Lender to be held as part of the Collateral.\n\n**Validity; Binding Effect.** This Agreement is binding upon Grantor and Grantor’s successors and assigns and is legally enforceable in accordance with its terms.\n\n**Loan No: 5037422** | **ASSIGNMENT OF DEPOSIT ACCOUNT** **(Continued)** | **Page 2**  \n---|---|---  \n  \n**Financing Statements.** Grantor authorizes Lender to file a UCC financing statement, or alternatively, a copy of this Agreement to perfect Lender’s security interest. At Lender’s request, Grantor additionally agrees to sign all other documents that are necessary to perfect, protect, and continue Lender’s security interest in the Property. Grantor will pay all filing fees, title transfer fees, and other fees and costs involved unless prohibited by law or unless Lender is required by law to pay such fees and costs. Grantor irrevocably appoints Lender to execute documents necessary to transfer title if there is a default. Lender may file a copy of this Agreement as a financing statement.\n\n**LENDER’S RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLATERAL.** While this Agreement is in effect, Lender may retain the rights to possession of the Collateral, together with any and all evidence of the Collateral, such as certificates or passbooks. This Agreement will remain in effect until (a) there no longer is any Indebtedness owing to Lender; (b) all other obligations secured by this Agreement have been fulfilled; and (c) Grantor, in writing, has requested from Lender a release of this Agreement.\n\n**LENDER’S EXPENDITURES.** If any action or proceeding is commenced that would materially affect Lender’s interest in the Collateral or if Grantor fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement or any Related Documents, including but not limited to Grantor’s failure to discharge or pay when due any amounts Grantor is required to discharge or pay under this Agreement or any Related Documents, Lender on Grantor’s behalf may (but shall not be obligated to) take any action that Lender deems appropriate, including but not limited to discharging or paying all taxes, liens, security interests, encumbrances and other claims, at any time levied or placed on the Collateral and paying all costs for insuring, maintaining and preserving the Collateral. All such expenditures incurred or paid by Lender for such purposes will then bear interest at the rate charged under the Note from the date incurred or paid by Lender to the date of repayment by Grantor. All such expenses will become a part of the Indebtedness and, at Lender’s option, will (A) be payable on demand; (B) be added to the balance of the Note and be apportioned among and be payable with any installment payments to become due during either (1) the term of any applicable insurance policy; or (2) the remaining term of the Note; or (C) be treated as a balloon payment which will be due and payable at the Note’s maturity. The Agreement also will secure payment of these amounts. Such right shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies to which Lender may be entitled upon the occurrence of any Event of Default.\n\n**LIMITATIONS ON OBLIGATIONS OF LENDER.** Lender shall use ordinary reasonable care in the physical preservation and custody of any certificate or passbook for the Collateral but shall have no other obligation to protect the Collateral or its value. In particular, but without limitation, Lender shall have no responsibility (A) for the collection or protection of any income on the Collateral; (B) for the preservation of rights against issuers of the Collateral or against third persons; (C) for ascertaining any maturities, conversions, exchanges, offers, tenders, or similar matters relating to the Collateral; nor (D) for informing the Grantor about any of the above, whether or not Lender has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters.\n\n**DEFAULT.** Each of the following shall constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement:\n\n**Payment Default.** Borrower fails to make any payment when due under the Indebtedness.\n\n**Other Defaults.** Borrower or Grantor fails to comply with or to perform any other term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or in any of the Related Documents or to comply with or to perform any term, obligation, covenant or condition contained in any other agreement between Lender and Borrower or Grantor.\n\n**Default in Favor of Third Parties.** Borrower, any guarantor or Grantor defaults under any loan, extension of credit, security agreement, purchase or sales agreement, or any other agreement, in favor of any other creditor or person that may materially affect any of Borrower’s, any guarantor’s or Grantor’s property or ability to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement or any of the Related Documents.\n\n**False Statements.** Any warranty, representation or statement made or furnished to Lender by Borrower or Grantor or on Borrower’s or Grantor’s behalf under this Agreement or the Related Documents is false or misleading in any material respect, either now or at the time made or furnished or becomes false or misleading at any time thereafter.\n\n**Defective Collateralization.** This Agreement or any of the Related Documents ceases to be in full force and effect (including failure of any collateral document to create a valid and perfected security interest or lien) at any time and for any reason.\n\n**Insolvency.** The dissolution or termination of Borrower’s or Grantor’s existence as a going business, the insolvency of Borrower or Grantor, the appointment of a receiver for any part of Borrower’s or Grantor’s property, any assignment for the benefit of creditors, any type of creditor workout, or the commencement of any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws by or against Borrower or Grantor.\n\n**Creditor or Forfeiture Proceedings.** Commencement of foreclosure or forfeiture proceedings, whether by judicial proceeding, self-help, repossession or any other method, by any creditor of Borrower or Grantor or by any governmental agency against any collateral securing the Indebtedness. This includes a garnishment of any of Borrower’s or Grantor’s accounts, including deposit accounts, with Lender. However, this Event of Default shall not apply if there is a good faith dispute by Borrower or Grantor as to the validity or reasonableness of the claim which is the basis of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and if Borrower or Grantor gives Lender written notice of the creditor or forfeiture proceeding and deposits with Lender monies or a surety bond for the creditor or forfeiture proceeding, in an amount determined by Lender, in its sole discretion, as being an adequate reserve or bond for the dispute.\n\n**Events Affecting Guarantor.** Any of the preceding events occurs with respect to any Guarantor of any of the Indebtedness or Guarantor dies or becomes incompetent or revokes or disputes the validity of, or liability under, any Guaranty of the Indebtedness.\n\n**Adverse Change.** A material adverse change occurs in Borrower’s or Grantor’s financial condition, or Lender believes the prospect of payment or performance of the Indebtedness is impaired.\n\n**Cure Provisions.** If any default, other than a default in payment, is curable and if Grantor has not been given a notice of a breach of the same provision of this Agreement within the preceding twelve (12) months, it may be cured if Grantor, after Lender sends written notice to Borrower demanding cure of such default: (1) cures the default within ten (10) days; or (2) if the cure requires more than ten (10) days, immediately initiates steps which Lender deems in Lender’s sole discretion to be sufficient to cure the default and thereafter continues and completes all reasonable and necessary steps sufficient to produce compliance as soon as reasonably practical.\n\n**RIGHTS AND REMEDIES ON DEFAULT.** Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, or at any time thereafter, Lender may exercise any one or more of the following rights and remedies, in addition to any rights or remedies that may be available at law, in equity, or otherwise:\n\n**Accelerate Indebtedness.** Lender may declare all Indebtedness of Borrower to Lender immediately due and payable, without notice of any kind to Borrower or Grantor.\n\n**Application of Account Proceeds.** Lender may take directly all funds in the Account and apply them to the Indebtedness. If the Account is subject to an early withdrawal penalty, that penalty shall be deducted from the Account before its application to the Indebtedness, whether the Account is with Lender or some other institution. Any excess funds remaining after application of the Account proceeds to the Indebtedness will be paid to Borrower or Grantor as the interests of Borrower or Grantor may appear. Borrower agrees, to the extent permitted by law, to pay any deficiency after application of the proceeds of the Account to the Indebtedness. Lender also shall have all the rights of a secured party under the Minnesota Uniform Commercial Code, even if the Account is not otherwise subject to such Code concerning security interests, and the parties to this Agreement agree that the provisions of the Code giving rights to a secured party shall nonetheless be a part of this Agreement.\n\n**Loan No: 5037422** | **ASSIGNMENT OF DEPOSIT ACCOUNT** **(Continued)** | **Page 3**  \n---|---|---  \n  \n**Transfer Title.** Lender may effect transfer of title upon sale of all or part of the Collateral. For this purpose, Grantor irrevocably appoints Lender as Grantor’s attorney-in-fact to execute endorsements, assignments and instruments in the name of Grantor and each of them (if more than one) as shall be necessary or reasonable.\n\n**Other Rights and Remedies.** Lender shall have and may exercise any or all of the rights and remedies of a secured creditor under the provisions of the Minnesota Uniform Commercial Code, at law, in equity, or otherwise.\n\n**Deficiency Judgment.** If permitted by applicable law, Lender may obtain a judgment for any deficiency remaining in the Indebtedness due to Lender after application of all amounts received from the exercise of the rights provided in this section.\n\n**Election of Remedies.** Except as may be prohibited by applicable law, all of Lender’s rights and remedies, whether evidenced by this Agreement or by any other writing, shall be cumulative and may be exercised singularly or concurrently. Election by Lender to pursue any remedy shall not exclude pursuit of any other remedy, and an election to make expenditures or to take action to perform an obligation of Grantor under this Agreement, after Grantor’s failure to perform, shall not affect Lender’s right to declare a default and exercise its remedies.\n\n**Cumulative Remedies.** All of Lender’s rights and remedies, whether evidenced by this Agreement or by any other writing, shall be cumulative and may be exercised singularly or concurrently. Election by Lender to pursue any remedy shall not exclude pursuit of any other remedy, and an election to make expenditures or to take action to perform an obligation of Grantor under this Agreement, after Grantor’s failure to perform, shall not affect Lender’s right to declare a default and to exercise its remedies.\n\n**MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.** The following miscellaneous provisions are a part of this Agreement:\n\n**Amendments.** This Agreement, together with any Related Documents, constitutes the entire understanding and agreement of the parties as to the matters set forth in this Agreement. No alteration of or amendment to this Agreement shall be effective unless given in writing and signed by the party or parties sought to be charged or bound by the alteration or amendment.\n\n**Attorneys’ Fees; Expenses.** Grantor agrees to pay upon demand all of Lender’s costs and expenses, including Lender’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and Lender’s legal expenses, incurred in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement. Lender may hire or pay someone else to help enforce this Agreement, and Grantor shall pay the costs and expenses of such enforcement. Costs and expenses include Lender’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and legal expenses whether or not there is a lawsuit, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and legal expenses for bankruptcy proceedings (including efforts to modify or vacate any automatic stay or injunction), appeals, and any anticipated post-judgment collection services. Grantor also shall pay all court costs and such additional fees as may be directed by the court.\n\n**Caption Headings.** Caption headings in this Agreement are for convenience purposes only and are not to be used to interpret or define the provisions of this Agreement.\n\n**Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by federal law applicable to Lender and, to the extent not preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of Minnesota without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. This Agreement has been accepted by Lender in the State of Minnesota.**\n\n**Joint and Several Liability.** All obligations of Borrower and Grantor under this Agreement shall be joint and several, and all references to Grantor shall mean each and every Grantor, and all references to Borrower shall mean each and every Borrower. This means that each Borrower and Grantor signing below is responsible for all obligations in this Agreement. Where any one or more of the parties is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or similar entity, it is not necessary for Lender to inquire into the powers of any of the officers, directors, partners, members, or other agents acting or purporting to act on the entity’s behalf, and any obligations made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed under this Agreement.\n\n**No Waiver by Lender.** Lender shall not be deemed to have waived any rights under this Agreement unless such waiver is given in writing and signed by Lender. No delay or omission on the part of Lender in exercising any right shall operate as a waiver of such right or any other right. A waiver by Lender of a provision of this Agreement shall not prejudice or constitute a waiver of Lender’s right otherwise to demand strict compliance with that provision or any other provision of this Agreement. No prior waiver by Lender, nor any course of dealing between Lender and Grantor, shall constitute a waiver of any of Lender’s rights or of any of Grantor’s obligations as to any future transactions. Whenever the consent of Lender is required under this Agreement, the granting of such consent by Lender in any instance shall not constitute continuing consent to subsequent instances where such consent is required and in all cases such consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of Lender.\n\n**Notices.** Any notice required to be given under this Agreement shall be given in writing, and shall be effective when actually delivered, when actually received by telefacsimile (unless otherwise required by law), when deposited with a nationally recognized overnight courier, or, if mailed, when deposited in the United States mail, as first class, certified or registered mail postage prepaid, directed to the addresses shown near the beginning of this Agreement. Any party may change its address for notices under this Agreement by giving formal written notice to the other parties, specifying that the purpose of the notice is to change the party’s address. For notice purposes, Grantor agrees to keep Lender informed at all times of Grantor’s current address. Unless otherwise provided or required by law, if there is more than one Grantor, any notice given by Lender to any Grantor is deemed to be notice given to all Grantors.\n\n**Power of Attorney.** Grantor hereby appoints Lender as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact, irrevocably, with full power of substitution to do the following: (1) to demand, collect, receive, receipt for, sue and recover all sums of money or other property which may now or hereafter become due, owing or payable from the Collateral; (2) to execute, sign and endorse any and all claims, instruments, receipts, checks, drafts or warrants issued in payment for the Collateral; (3) to settle or compromise any and all claims arising under the Collateral, and in the place and stead of Grantor, to execute and deliver its release and settlement for the claim; and (4) to file any claim or claims or to take any action or institute or take part in any proceedings, either in its own name or in the name of Grantor, or otherwise, which in the discretion of Lender may seem to be necessary or advisable. This power is given as security for the Indebtedness, and the authority hereby conferred is and shall be irrevocable and shall remain in full force and effect until renounced by Lender.\n\n**Severability.** If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable as to any circumstance, that finding shall not make the offending provision illegal, invalid, or unenforceable as to any other circumstance. If feasible, the offending provision shall be considered modified so that it becomes legal, valid and enforceable. If the offending provision cannot be so modified, it shall be considered deleted from this Agreement. Unless otherwise required by law, the illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement.\n\n**Successors and Assigns.** Subject to any limitations stated in this Agreement on transfer of Grantor’s interest, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and assigns. If ownership of the Collateral becomes vested in a person other than Grantor, Lender, without notice to Grantor, may deal with Grantor’s successors with reference to this Agreement and the Indebtedness by way of forbearance or extension without releasing Grantor from the obligations of this Agreement or liability under the Indebtedness.\n\n**Loan No: 5037422** | **ASSIGNMENT OF DEPOSIT ACCOUNT** **(Continued)** | **Page 4**  \n---|---|---  \n  \n**Survival of Representations and Warranties.** All representations, warranties, and agreements made by Grantor in this Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement, shall be continuing in nature, and shall remain in full force and effect until such time as Borrower’s Indebtedness shall be paid in full.\n\n**Time is of the Essence.** Time is of the essence in the performance of this Agreement.\n\n**DEFINITIONS.** The following capitalized words and terms shall have the following meanings when used in this Agreement.

(the \"Company”, \"we”, or \"our”) is offering on a best-efforts basis up to [*] shares of its common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the \"Common Stock”), at an assumed public offering price of $[*] per share, based upon the last reported sale price of our Common Stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market on [*], 2024.\n\nWe are also offering to those purchasers, if any, whose purchase of Common Stock in this offering would otherwise result in the purchaser, together with its affiliates and certain related parties, beneficially owning more than 4.99% (or, at the election of the purchaser, 9.99%) of our outstanding Common Stock immediately following the consummation of this offering, the opportunity to purchase, if the purchaser so chooses, pre-funded warrants to purchase Common Stock (each a \"Pre-funded Warrant”) at an exercise price of $0.00001 per share. The purchase price of each Pre-funded Warrant is equal to the price per share of Common Stock being sold to the public in this offering, minus $0.00001. The Pre-funded Warrants will be immediately exercisable and may be exercised at any time until all of the Pre-funded Warrants are exercised in full. For each Pre-funded Warrant that we sell, the number of shares of Common Stock that we are offering will be decreased on a one-for-one basis.\n\nOur Common Stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \"MGOL.” The last reported sale price of our Common Stock on Nasdaq on [*], 2024 was $[*] per share. There is no established trading market for the Pre-funded Warrants and we do not intend to list the Pre-funded Warrants on any securities exchange or nationally recognized trading system.\n\nThe Common Stock and Pre-funded Warrants, if any, will be offered at a fixed price and are expected to be issued in a single closing. There is no minimum number of securities or minimum aggregate amount of proceeds for this offering to close. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the shares of our Common Stock underlying any Pre-funded Warrants will be offered on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We expect this offering to be completed not later than one business day following the commencement of sales in this offering (after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part) and we will deliver all securities to be issued in connection with this offering delivery versus payment or receipt versus payment, as the case may be, upon receipt of investor funds received by us. Accordingly, neither we nor the placement agent have made any arrangements to place investor funds in an escrow account or trust account since the placement agent will not receive investor funds in connection with the sale of the securities offered hereunder.\n\nWe have engaged Maxim Group LLC (the \"placement agent” or \"Maxim”), to act as our exclusive placement agent in connection with this offering. The placement agent has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit offers to purchase the securities offered by this prospectus. The placement agent is not purchasing or selling any of the securities we are offering, and the placement agent is not required to arrange the purchase or sale of any specific number or dollar amount of securities. Because there is no minimum offering amount required as a condition to closing in this offering, the actual offering amount, placement agent’s fee and proceeds to us, if any, are not presently determinable and may be substantially less than the total maximum offering amounts described throughout this prospectus. We have agreed to pay the placement agent, the placement agent fees set forth in the table below and to provide certain other compensation to the Placement Agent. See \"Plan of Distribution” for more information regarding these arrangements.\n\n**Investing in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. See \"_Risk Factors_ ” beginning on page 8 of this prospectus for a discussion of information that should be considered in connection with an investment in our Common Stock.**\n\n**NEITHER THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED THESE SECURITIES OR DETERMINED IF THIS PROSPECTUS IS TRUTHFUL OR COMPLETE.

Our mission is to provide customers with unmatched variety, quality and shopping experience, while adding considerable value for MGO’s shareholders.\n\nOur accomplished leadership team encompasses decades of experience in building successful global lifestyle brands, including fashion design, marketing, technology, corporate finance and branding. We strive to continually push innovation and evolution of the consumer product cycle without compromising quality and design integrity. Through our end-to-end, scalable brand-building platform, backed by robust consumer behavioral data, we are engaged in nurturing digitally native brands that will thrive in the modern Direct to Consumer (\"DTC”) economy.\n\nIn 2018, we signed a global licensing agreement with, Leo Messi Management SA (\"LMM”), soccer legend Lionel Messi’s licensing and management company and created the \"Messi Brand” – a line of casual wear and accessories inspired by his trend-setting style and offered on The Messi Store (www.themessistore.com). Designed by the Company’s co-founder and Chief Brand Officer, Virginia Hilfiger, the _Messi Brand_ ’s DNA is rooted in Messi’s personal style and emphasizes accessibility, comfort and ease.\n\n2  \n---  \n  \nIn March 2024, we assigned our global licensing agreement with LMM (\"LMM License Agreement”) to Centric Brands, LLC (\"Centric”). Centric is a global leading lifestyle brand collective that has expertise in product design, development and sourcing; retail and digital commerce; marketing and brand building. Centric designs, sources, markets, and sells high-quality products in the kid’s, men’s and women’s apparel, accessories, beauty, and entertainment categories. The company’s portfolio includes licenses for more than 100 iconic brands, including Calvin Klein®, Tommy Hilfiger®, Nautica®, Spyder®, and Under Armour® in the kid’s category; Joe’s Jeans®, Buffalo®, Hervé Léger®, and IZOD® in the men’s and women’s apparel category; Coach®, Kate Spade®, Michael Kors®, All Saints®, Frye®, Timberland®, Hunter®, and Jessica Simpson® in the accessories category; and in the entertainment category, Disney®, Marvel®, Nickelodeon®, and Warner Brothers® among many others. The company also owns and operates Zac Posen®, Hudson®, Robert Graham®, Avirex®, Fiorelli®, and Taste Beauty® and operates a joint venture brand, Favorite Daughter, with Sara and Erin Foster. The company’s products are sold through leading mass-market retailers, specialty and department stores and online. The company is headquartered in New York City with U.S. offices in Los Angeles and Greensboro, and international offices in Asia, Europe, Montreal and Toronto. In connection with the assignment of the LMM License Agreement, Centric paid MGO $2,000,000 in cash and assumed the obligation to pay €1,500,000 in aggregate royalty payments due to LMM in 2024.\n\nWhile the _Messi Brand_ was previously the only asset in our portfolio through early 2023, our business model has remained centered on strategic expansion through collaborations, licensing, acquisitions and organic development. As our brand portfolio expands, we intend to drive the commercial value of each brand through our own DTC platform methodologies, ensuring that each brand maintains its own unique identity while remaining thoughtfully aligned with the values of our customers.\n\nIn November 2022, we formed MGO Digital LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary which leverages data analytics, advanced technology-enabled marketing and our leadership team’s industry relationships and expertise to identify, incubate and introduce to market new, authentic brand concepts.\n\nIn March 2023, we obtained a royalty-free, worldwide and exclusive license to the assets of Stand CO, LLC, a DTC digitally native brand which offers a line of high quality, residential flagpoles, American flags, solar flagpole light kits, flagpole finials, patriotic-themed apparel and other products. _Stand Flagpoles_ brought to our brand portfolio immediate revenue generation and the opportunity to further demonstrate the benefits of its end-to-end, data-driven brand-building platform to help accelerate and optimize long-term growth. In late March 2023, the Company formed Americana Liberty, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary focused exclusively on supporting the new DTC flagpole and related product line.\n\n**Corporate Information**\n\nWe were incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 30, 2021. Our principal executive offices are located at 1515 SE 17th Street, Suite 121/#460236, Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33346 and our telephone number is 347-913-3316. Our corporate website address is _www.mgoglobalinc.com_. Information on or that can be accessed through our website is not part of this prospectus and should not be relied upon in determining whether to make an investment decision.\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\n**_Amendment to 2022 Equity Incentive Plan_**. On April 12, 2024, the Board unanimously authorized and approved an amendment (\"Plan Amendment”) to MGO’s 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2022 Plan”) to increase the number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock, par value $0.00001 per share, (\"Common Stock”) reserved for issuance under the 2022 Plan by an additional 1,825,413 shares of Common Stock. Such increase will result in a total of 4,511,883 shares of Common Stock being reserved under the 2022 Plan, of which 2,050,705 will be available for future awards. On April 17, 2024 (the \"Record Date”), a majority of our stockholders consented to the Plan Amendment.\n\n**_Reverse Stock Split._** On July 18, 2024, we effected a reverse stock split of our Common Stock at a ratio of 1:10 The reverse stock split did not affect MGO’s authorized shares of preferred and Common Stock, which remain at 20,000,000 and 150,000,000 shares, respectively. The par value of each share of preferred and Common Stock remains unchanged at $0.00001.\n\n**_Business Combination_** _._ On June 18, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive Business Combination Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Business Combination Agreement”) with Heidmar, Inc., (\"Heidmar”), a company organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Heidmar Maritime Holdings Corp., a company organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (\"Holdings”), and HMR Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings (\"Merger Sub”), and Rhea Marine Ltd. and Maistros Shipinvest Corp (the \"Heidmar Shareholders”).\n\n3  \n---  \n  \nPursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, the parties will effect a business combination involving the following transactions (collectively, the \"Business Combination”):\n\n(a) | Merger Sub will merge (the \"Merger”) with and into the MGO, with MGO continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings;  \n---|---  \n(b) | all of the issued and outstanding Common Stock prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into the right to receive common shares of Holdings (the \"Holdings Shares”) on a one-for-one basis at the Closing of the Business Combination;  \n(c) | immediately after the effective time of the Merger, the Heidmar Shareholders will transfer all of their outstanding shares of Common Stock of Heidmar to Holdings (the \"Heidmar Share Acquisition”), with Heidmar becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings; and  \n(d) | Holdings shall issue to the Heidmar Shareholders (i) at the closing of the Business Combination (the \"Closing”), a number of Holdings Shares equal to (x) the number of the Company’s outstanding shares of Common Stock on a fully diluted and as-converted basis immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, times (y) 16.6667 and (ii) after the Closing and upon the satisfaction of certain earnout conditions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement, additional Holdings Shares equal to 10% of the shares issued to the Heidmar Shareholders on the Closing, with 2.64% of each issuance being distributed to MGO’s financial advisor.  \n  \nFollowing the Closing, both MGO and Heidmar will be wholly owned subsidiaries of Holdings, and the Holdings Shares will be publicly listed on Nasdaq. The parties expect that after the Closing, the Heidmar Shareholders will own 94.34% of Holdings (including amounts to be distributed to MGO’s financial advisor), and the MGO stockholders will own 5.66% of Holdings, without taking into account the issuance of any Earnout Shares. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, any shares of common stock that MGO issues prior to the Closing will not change these percentages.\n\nOne of the conditions to the Closing is that Holdings is approved for listing on Nasdaq.\n\nThe Company has obtained an independent fairness opinion from Newbridge Securities Corporation dated June 18, 2024, which states that in the opinion of Newbridge Securities Corporation, based on Holdings having a value of $300 million, the number of Holdings Shares issued to the Company’s stockholders in exchange for their shares of MGO Common Stock is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company’s stockholders.\n\nOn August 22, 2024, Holdings confidentially submitted a Form F-4 Draft Registration Statement for the purpose of soliciting the votes of the Company’s stockholders to approve the Merger and register the Holdings shares that will be issued to the Company’s stockholders and its financial advisor in connection with the Business Combination. For a more detailed description of the Business Combination and the associated risk factors see the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on June 20, 2024 and \"Risk Factors—Risks Associated with the Business Combination, Heidmar and Holdings.\n\n**FOR MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS COMBINATION, THE RISK FACTORS INVOLVED THEREIN, AND INFORMATION REGARDING HOLDINGS AND HEIDMAR, INCLUDING MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION ON HEIDMAR AND PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY AND HOLDINGS, PLEASE SEE EXHIBIT 99.1 TO THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT RELATED TO THIS PROSPECTUS.**\n\n**Summary Risk Factors**\n\nOur business is subject to a number of risks. You should be aware of these risks before making an investment decision. These risks are discussed more fully in the section of this prospectus titled \"_Risk Factors_ ,” which begins on page 8 of this prospectus, and include, among others, the following:\n\n● | The consummation of the Business Combination is subject to the closing conditions contained in the Business Combination Agreement and could be delayed or may never occur;  \n---|---  \n● | MGO and Heidmar will incur significant transaction and transition costs in connection with the Business Combination;  \n● | The announcement of the proposed Business Combination could disrupt Heidmar’s relationships with its customers, suppliers, business partners and others, as well as its operating results and business generally;  \n● | After the Business Combination, Holdings may be exposed to unknown or contingent liabilities and may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on its financial condition, results of operations and share price;  \n  \n4  \n---  \n  \n● | Due to potential fluctuations in the market value of Holdings Shares, MGO Stockholders cannot be sure of the market value of the consideration that they will receive in the Business Combination ;  \n---|---  \n● | If the Business Combination is not completed by the Outside Date either MGO or Heidmar may have the right to terminate the Business Combination Agreement;  \n● | The Business Combination Agreement contains restrictions on the ability of Heidmar and MGO to pursue alternatives to the Business Combination;  \n● | Termination of the Business Combination Agreement could negatively impact MGO and Heidmar;  \n● | If the Business Combination is consummated, MGO Stockholders will experience immediate and material dilution;   \n● | Holdings’ ability to be successful following the Business Combination will depend upon the efforts of the Heidmar’s officers and the loss of such persons could negatively impact the operations and profitability of the post-Business Combination business;  \n● | The directors and officers of Holdings have not had experience managing a business like MGO’s and may not succeed in attracting capable managers, which could cause MGO’s business and financial condition to suffer;  \n● | The IRS may not agree that Holdings (i) should be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (ii) should not be treated as a \"surrogate foreign corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes;  \n● | If Holdings is a passive foreign investment company for United States federal income tax purposes for any taxable year, U.S. holders of Holdings Shares could be subject to adverse United States federal income tax consequences;  \n● | The Business Combination may not qualify as a non-taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes;  \n● | There can be no assurance that the Holdings Shares will be approved for listing on Nasdaq or any other national securities exchange, or that Holdings will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq or any other national securities exchange;  \n● | Holdings is an emerging growth company and will therefore be subject to reduced reporting requirements that may make the Holdings Shares less attractive to investors;  \n● | Holdings will be a \"controlled company” within the meaning of the Nasdaq rules and will be exempt from certain corporate governance requirements as a result;  \n● | Holdings will be a \"foreign private issuer” under U.S. securities laws, which exempts it from certain reporting and other obligations and could make the Holdings Shares less attractive to some investors;  \n● | Holdings may lose its foreign private issuer status in the future, which could result in significant additional costs and expenses;  \n● | Investor confidence and the market price of Holdings’ shares may be adversely impacted if Holdings’ management is unable to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting;  \n● | Upon completion of the Business Combination, MGO Stockholders will become shareholders of Holdings, and the market price for the Holdings Shares may be affected by factors different from those that historically have affected MGO;   \n● | The requirements of being a public company may strain Holdings’ resources, divert Holdings management’s attention and affect Holdings’ ability to attract and retain qualified board members;   \n● | Future sales of Holdings Shares, including resales by the Heidmar Shareholders and other significant shareholders, may cause the market price of the Holdings Shares to drop significantly, even if Holdings’ business is doing well;  \n  \n5  \n---  \n  \n● | The market price of Holdings Shares may be volatile, and you may lose all or part of your investment;  \n---|---  \n● | Holdings is a holding company that depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute funds to it in order to satisfy its financial and other obligations;   \n● | Currently, there is no public market for the Holdings Shares. MGO Stockholders cannot be sure that an active trading market will develop for the Holdings Shares, the market price they will receive or that Holdings will successfully obtain authorization for listing on the Nasdaq;  \n● | We have a history of operating losses and may continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We may not be able to generate sufficient net sales to achieve or maintain profitability. Failure to maintain an adequate growth rate will materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results;  \n● | Because we operate in an evolving industry, our past results may not be indicative of future performance, and our future performance may fluctuate materially which will increase your investment risk;  \n● | If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed;  \n● | Our sales may be adversely affected if we fail to respond to changes in consumer preferences in a timely manner or are not successful in expanding our product offerings;  \n● | Uncertainties in economic conditions and their impact on consumer spending patterns could adversely impact our operating results;  \n● | Failure of our vendors to supply high quality and compliant merchandise in a timely manner may damage our reputation and brand and harm our business;  \n● | Government regulation of the Internet and ecommerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and results of operations;  \n● | Our failure or the failure of third-party service providers to protect our site, networks and systems against security breaches, or otherwise to protect our confidential information, could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business and operating results;  \n● | If we lose any of our key management personnel, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives;  \n● | We may incur material losses and costs as a result of manufacturer’s product defects, warranty claims or product liability actions that may be brought against us;  \n● | The price of our Common Stock may rapidly fluctuate or may decline regardless of our operating performance, resulting in substantial losses for investors;  \n● | We are an \"emerging growth company” and a \"smaller reporting company” under the JOBS Act, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies will make our Common Stock less attractive to investors;  \n  \n6  \n---  \n  \n**SUMMARY OF THE OFFERING**\n\n_The following summary contains basic terms about this offering and the Common Stock and is not intended to be complete.

If any of the risks discussed in this prospectus occur, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, in which case the trading price of our Common Stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Some statements in this prospectus, including statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section entitled \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”_\n\n**Risks Related to the Business Combination**\n\n_As described under \"Prospectus Summary - Recent Developments”, the Company has entered into the Business Combination Agreement, which if approved by our stockholders and completed in accordance with its terms, the shares of the Company’s common stock will be cancelled and our former stockholders will receive common shares of Holdings.**The risks related to Heidmar and Holdings are described in Exhibit 99.1 to the Registration Statement which this prospectus forms a part.**_\n\n**_The consummation of the Business Combination is subject to the closing conditions contained in the Business Combination Agreement and could be delayed or may never occur._**\n\nThe consummation of the Business Combination is subject to the closing conditions contained in the Business Combination Agreement and could be delayed or may never occur. Accordingly, any shares of Common Stock of the Company (\"MGO Shares”) offered and purchased (including newly issued MGO Shares sold under MGO’s at-the-market program or through other capital raising activities) following the announcement of the Business Combination but prior to the Closing is an investment in the Company. The Business Combination is subject to the approval of the stockholders of MGO (the \"MGO Stockholders”), and while stockholders holding a majority of the issued and outstanding MGO Shares have agreed to vote to approve the Business Combination, it is possible that events could occur that would prevent this approval from being obtained. The closing conditions that must be satisfied or waived before the Closing can occur are specified in the Business Combination Agreement and include: (i) the representations and warranties of MGO, Heidmar and the Heidmar Shareholders being true and correct subject to the materiality standards contained in the Business Combination Agreement; (ii) material compliance by the parties of their respective pre-closing covenants and agreements, subject to the standards contained in the Business Combination Agreement; (iii) the absence of any Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) with respect to Heidmar since the effective date of the Business Combination Agreement that is continuing and uncured; (iv) the expiration or termination, as applicable, of any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Business Combination Agreement under any antitrust laws; (v) that no governmental authority of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted any law or order in effect at the time of Closing which has the effect of making the Business Combination or other ancillary Transactions illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Business Combination or ancillary Transactions; (vi) the Registration Statement (as defined below) being declared effective by the SEC; (vii) the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Holdings having been amended and restated as set forth in an exhibit to the Business Combination Agreement; (viii) the entry into certain ancillary agreements as of the Closing; (ix) the approval of the listing of the Holdings Shares on Nasdaq (or another national securities exchange), and (x) the receipt of certain closing deliverables. MGO and Heidmar may not satisfy all of the closing conditions in the Business Combination Agreement. If the closing conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Business Combination will not occur, or will be delayed pending later satisfaction or waiver, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\n\nFurther, the aggregate percentages of Holdings Shares to be issued to the holders of MGO Shares on one hand and the Heidmar Shareholders on the other immediately after the consummation of the Business Combination is fixed pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement. Accordingly, the issuance of new MGO Shares following announcement of the Business Combination Agreement, including through the Company’s at-the-market sales program or other capital raises, will not increase the aggregate ownership percentage of Holdings Shares to be issued to holders of MGO Shares following consummation of the Business Combination, but will dilute the Holdings ownership percentage that each individual holder of MGO Shares would receive.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \n**_MGO and Heidmar will incur significant transaction and transition costs in connection with the Business Combination._**\n\nMGO, Holdings and Heidmar have incurred and expect to incur significant, non-recurring costs in connection with consummating the Business Combination, including legal, accounting, consulting, investment banking and other fees, expenses and costs. In addition, Holdings will incur significant costs operating as a public company following the consummation of the Business Combination and may also incur additional costs to retain key employees. Generally, transaction expenses incurred in connection with the Business Combination will be paid by the party incurring those expenses, and many of those expenses might not be paid until after the Closing. Accordingly, these expenses could result in Holdings having less money following the Closing to spend on other aspects of its business, particularly if the actual expenses turn out to be higher than anticipated.\n\n**_Legal proceedings in connection with the Business Combination, the outcomes of which are uncertain, could delay or prevent the completion of the Business Combination._**\n\nIn connection with transactions like the proposed Business Combination, it is not uncommon for lawsuits to be filed against the parties and/or their respective directors and officers alleging, among other things, that the proxy statement/prospectus provided to shareholders contains false and misleading statements and/or omits material information concerning the transaction. Although no such lawsuits have yet been filed in connection with the Business Combination, it is possible that such actions may arise and, if they do arise, to seek, among other things, injunctive relief and an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses. Defending such lawsuits could require MGO, Heidmar and Holdings to incur significant costs and draw the attention of MGO’s and Heidmar’s management teams away from the consummation of the Business Combination and the management of their respective businesses. Further, the defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the Business Combination is consummated may adversely affect Holdings’ business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such legal proceedings could delay or prevent the Business Combination from being consummated within the expected timeframe.\n\n**_The announcement of the proposed Business Combination could disrupt Heidmar’s relationships with its customers, suppliers, business partners and others, as well as its operating results and business generally._**\n\nRisks relating to the announcement of the Business Combination on Heidmar’s business include the following:\n\n● | its employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles, which might adversely affect Heidmar’s ability to retain and hire key personnel and other employees;  \n---|---  \n● | customers, suppliers, business partners and other parties with which Heidmar maintains business relationships may experience uncertainty about its future and seek alternative relationships with third parties, seek to alter their business relationships with Heidmar or fail to extend an existing relationship with Heidmar; and  \n● | Heidmar has expended and will continue to expend significant costs, fees and expenses for professional services and transaction costs in connection with the proposed Business Combination.  \n  \nIf any of the aforementioned risks were to materialize, they could lead to significant costs which may impact Holdings’ results of operations and cash available to fund its business.\n\n**_After the Business Combination, Holdings may be exposed to unknown or contingent liabilities and may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on its financial condition, results of operations and share price._**\n\nIt is possible that the due diligence conducted in relation to Heidmar and MGO and their respective businesses did not identify all material issues or risks associated with these companies or the industries in which they compete.\n\nFurthermore, factors outside of the parties’ control could arise later. As a result of these factors, Holdings may be exposed to liabilities and incur additional costs and expenses and be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Even if the due diligence has identified certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with the parties’ preliminary risk analysis. If any of these risks materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on the Holdings’ financial condition and results of operations and could contribute to negative market perceptions about Holdings’ securities.\n\n**_Due to potential fluctuations in the market value of Holdings Shares, MGO Stockholders cannot be sure of the market value of the consideration that they will receive in the Business Combination._**\n\nAfter the Closing, the Heidmar Shareholders will own 94.34% of Holdings (including amounts to be distributed to MGO’s financial advisor), and the MGO Stockholders will own 5.66% of Holdings, without taking into account the issuance of any Earnout Shares (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement). Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, any MGO Shares that MGO issues prior to Closing will not change these percentages.\n\n9  \n---  \n  \nThe consideration that eligible MGO Stockholders will receive upon consummation of the Business Combination Agreement is one Holdings Common Share for each share of MGO Common Stock (an \"MGO Share”). In addition, the Heidmar Shareholders will receive, for each Heidmar Share, a number of Holdings Shares equal to (a) the MGO Shares outstanding at Closing, times (b) 16.6667, divided by (c) the outstanding shares of Heidmar. Prior to the Closing, there has not been and will not be an established public trading market for Holdings Shares. The market value of Holdings Shares will reflect the combination of MGO and Heidmar under the terms of the Business Combination. Further, the MGO Merger Consideration will not be adjusted to reflect any changes in the number of MGO Shares outstanding, the market value of MGO Shares or currency Exchange Rates.\n\nChanges in the price of MGO Shares may result from a variety of factors, including, among others, changes in MGO’s business, operations or prospects, regulatory considerations, governmental actions, legal proceedings and general business, market, industry, political or economic conditions. Many of these factors are beyond MGO’s control. As a result, the aggregate market value of the Holdings Shares that a MGO Stockholder is entitled to receive at the Closing could vary significantly from the value of the equivalent MGO Shares on the date of the Business Combination Agreement, the date of this proxy statement/prospectus or at other times, and MGO Stockholders will neither know nor be able to calculate the value of the MGO Merger Consideration they would receive upon the Closing. MGO Stockholders are urged to obtain current market quotations for MGO Shares.\n\n**_If the Business Combination is not completed by the Outside Date either MGO or Heidmar may have the right to terminate the Business Combination Agreement._**\n\nIf the conditions to the obligations of Heidmar and MGO to consummate the Business Combination Agreement are not satisfied or waived (if applicable) by December 31, 2024, either MGO or Heidmar may have the right to terminate the Business Combination Agreement. MGO or Heidmar may elect to terminate the Business Combination Agreement in certain other circumstances, including if the MGO Stockholders fail to approve the Transactions at their respective shareholder meetings, and MGO and Heidmar can mutually decide to terminate the Business Combination Agreement at any time prior to the Merger Effective Time, before or after the required MGO Stockholder Approval.\n\n**_The Business Combination Agreement contains restrictions on the ability of Heidmar and MGO to pursue alternatives to the Business Combination._**\n\nThe Business Combination Agreement contains provisions that may discourage a third party from submitting a competing business combination proposal that might result in greater value to the Heidmar Shareholders or the MGO Stockholders than the Business Combination. These provisions include, among others, a general prohibition on Heidmar and MGO from soliciting or entering into discussions with any third party regarding, among other things, any business combination proposal, during the Interim Period.\n\n**_Certain MGO Stockholders who hold a majority of the MGO Shares have entered into agreements to vote in favor of the Transactions._**\n\nCertain MGO Stockholders who are officers or directors of MGO and hold a majority of the MGO Shares (the \"MGO Principals”) have entered into Voting and Support Agreements with MGO, Heidmar and Holdings, pursuant to which they have agreed, among other things, to vote their MGO Shares in favor of all the proposals presented for approval by MGO’s shareholders in respect of the Business Combination, including voting in favor of the Business Combination and to approve the Business Combination Agreement and not to transfer his or her MGO Shares (subject to certain exceptions). Further, in the Business Combination Agreement, MGO has agreed to not issue new MGO Shares prior to the Record Date if that issuance would cause the portion of MGO Shares held by the MGO Principals to fall to 50% or less. Accordingly, the votes of the MGO Principals can ensure that MGO’s shareholders will approve the Business Combination even if the remaining MGO Stockholders vote against it or otherwise believe the Business Combination is not in their best interests.\n\nEven if the Business Combination Agreement is approved by the MGO Stockholders, closing of the Business Combination still requires that certain closing conditions be satisfied or waived. It is possible that MGO, Heidmar and/or Holdings will fail to satisfy one or more conditions and this failure may not be waived by the other parties. If the closing conditions are not satisfied or waived by the applicable parties, the Business Combination will not occur, or will be delayed pending later satisfaction or waiver, and such delay may cause MGO, Holdings or Heidmar to lose some or all of the intended benefits of the Business Combination.\n\nFurther, satisfying the conditions to, and the completion of, the Business Combination may take longer and could cost more than Heidmar and MGO expect. Any delay or additional costs incurred in connection with completing the Business Combination could materially affect the benefits that Heidmar and MGO expect to achieve from the Business Combination.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \n**_Termination of the Business Combination Agreement could negatively impact MGO and Heidmar._**\n\nIf the Business Combination is not completed for any reason, including as a result of MGO Stockholders declining to adopt the Business Combination Agreement or declining to approve the proposals required to effect the Business Combination, the ongoing businesses of MGO and Heidmar may be adversely impacted and, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Business Combination, MGO and Heidmar would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\n● | MGO may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on MGO’s stock price (including to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Business Combination will be completed);  \n---|---  \n● | Heidmar may experience negative reactions from its customers, vendors and employees;  \n● | MGO and Heidmar will have incurred substantial expenses and will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Business Combination, whether or not the Business Combination is completed; and  \n● | since the Business Combination Agreement restricts the conduct of MGO’s and Heidmar’s businesses prior to completion of the Business Combination, each of MGO and Heidmar may not have been able to take certain actions during the pendency of the Business Combination that would have benefitted it as an independent company, and the opportunity to take such actions may no longer be available.  \n  \n**_If the Business Combination is consummated, MGO Stockholders will experience immediate and material dilution._**\n\nAfter the Closing, the MGO Stockholders will own 5.66% of Holdings, and the Heidmar Shareholders will own 94.34% of Holdings (including amounts to be distributed to MGO’s financial advisor), without taking into account the issuance of any Earnout Shares. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, any MGO Shares that MGO issues prior to Closing will not change these percentages. As such, the MGO Stockholders will experience immediate and material dilution upon Closing.\n\n**_Holdings’ ability to be successful following the Business Combination will depend upon the efforts of the Heidmar’s officers and the loss of such persons could negatively impact the operations and profitability of the post-Business Combination business._**\n\nHoldings’ ability to be successful following the Business Combination will be dependent upon the efforts of the certain key personnel of Heidmar. Although the parties expect key personnel to remain with Holdings following the Business Combination, there can be no assurance that they will do so. It is possible that Heidmar will lose some key personnel, the loss of which could negatively impact the operations and profitability of Holdings. Furthermore, following the Closing, certain of the key personnel of Heidmar may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a company regulated by the SEC, which could cause Holdings to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements.\n\n**_The directors and officers of Holdings have not had experience managing a business like MGO’s and may not succeed in attracting capable managers, which could cause MGO’s business and financial condition to suffer._**\n\nNone of the officers and directors of MGO will remain as officers or directors of MGO following the Business Combination. The officers and directors of Holdings following the Business Combination will be determined by Heidmar and will consist primarily of officers and directors of Heidmar. Heidmar is a commercial manager of ocean-going transport vessels, which is a very different business from the business that MGO manages, which is to design, manufacture, license, distribute, advertise and sell a range of products. Holdings may fail to find and employ capable and experienced personnel to manage and operate MGO’s business upon the Closing. If so, MGO’s business and its financial condition could suffer.\n\n**Risks Related to U.S. Federal Income Taxation of the Business Combination**\n\n**_The IRS may not agree that Holdings (i) should be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (ii) should not be treated as a \"surrogate foreign corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes_** _._\n\nUnder current U.S. federal income tax law, a corporation generally will be considered to be a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes only if it is created or organized in the United States or under the law of the United States or of any State or the District of Columbia. Accordingly, under generally applicable U.S. federal income tax rules, Holdings, which is not created or organized in the United States or under the law of the United States or of any State but is instead a Republic of the Marshall Islands incorporated entity and a tax resident of Greece, would generally be classified as a non-U.S. corporation. Section 7874 of the Code, and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, however, contain specific rules that may cause a non-U.S. corporation to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If it were determined that Holdings is treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874 of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, Holdings would be liable for U.S. federal income tax on its income just like any other U.S. corporation and certain distributions made by Holdings to Non-U.S. holders (as defined in \"_Certain Tax Considerations—U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations_ ”) of Holdings would be subject to U.S. withholding tax. In addition, even if Holdings is not treated as a U.S. corporation, it may be subject to unfavorable treatment as a \"surrogate foreign corporation” in the event that ownership attributable to former MGO Stockholders exceeds a threshold amount. If it were determined that Holdings is treated as a surrogate foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874 of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, dividends paid by Holdings would not qualify for \"qualified dividend income” treatment, and U.S. Affiliates of Holdings after the completion of the Business Combination, including MGO, could be subject to increased taxation under the inversion gain rules and Section 59A of the Code.\n\n11  \n---  \n  \nHoldings believes it should not be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874 of the Code or as a surrogate foreign corporation. However, whether the requirements for such treatment have been satisfied must be finally determined after the completion of the Business Combination, by which time there could be adverse changes to the relevant facts and circumstances. Furthermore, the interpretation of Treasury regulations relating to the required ownership of Holdings is subject to uncertainty and there is limited guidance regarding their application. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a contrary position to those described above or that a court will not agree with a contrary position of the IRS in the event of litigation. You are urged to consult your tax advisor to determine the tax consequences if the classification of Holdings as a non-U.S. corporation is not respected or if Holdings is treated as a surrogate foreign corporation.\n\n**_If Holdings is a passive foreign investment company for United States federal income tax purposes for any taxable year, U.S. holders of Holdings Shares could be subject to adverse United States federal income tax consequences_** _._\n\nIf Holdings is or becomes a \"passive foreign investment company,” or a PFIC, within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code for any taxable year during which a U.S. holder holds Holdings Shares, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences may apply to such U.S. holder. A non-U.S. corporation, such as Holdings, will be classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year in which, after applying certain look-through rules, either (i) 75% or more of its gross income for such year consists of certain types of \"passive” income or (ii) 50% or more of the value of its assets (determined on the basis of a quarterly average) during such year produce or are held for the production of passive income. Passive income generally includes dividends, interest, royalties, rents, annuities, net gains from the sale or exchange of property producing such income and net foreign currency gains. Heidmar does not believe that Holdings will be treated as a PFIC for its current taxable year and does not expect to become one in the near future. However, PFIC status depends on the composition of a company’s income and assets and the fair market value of its assets from time to time, as well as on the application of complex statutory and regulatory rules that are subject to potentially varying or changing interpretations.\n\nIf Holdings determines that it is a PFIC for any taxable year, Holdings will endeavor to provide, and will endeavor to cause its non-U.S. subsidiaries that are PFICs, to provide, U.S. holders with tax information necessary to enable a U.S. holder to make a qualified electing fund (QEF) election with respect to Holdings and its non-U.S. subsidiaries.\n\nIf Holdings is treated as a PFIC, a U.S. holder of Holdings Shares may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, such as taxation at the highest marginal ordinary income tax rates on capital gains and on certain actual or deemed distributions, interest charges on certain taxes treated as deferred, and additional reporting requirements. U.S. holders of Holdings Shares should consult with their tax advisors regarding the potential application of these rules.\n\n**_The Business Combination may not qualify as a non-taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**\n\nIf the Business Combination does not qualify as a non-taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of Holdings Shares in exchange for MGO Shares pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. Holder of MGO Shares that receives Holdings Shares pursuant to the Merger will generally recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the sum of the fair market value of the Holdings Shares received as consideration in the Merger and (ii) its adjusted tax basis in the MGO Shares surrendered in the exchange.\n\nIn certain circumstances, Section 304 of the Code may cause a holder of MGO Shares that also owns, actually or constructively, Heidmar Shares (and will actually or constructively own Holdings Shares issued in exchange for such Heidmar Shares pursuant to the Heidmar Share Acquisition) to be treated as receiving a dividend up to the fair market value of the Holdings Shares and cash received in the Merger, regardless of its gain or loss in the Merger.\n\n12  \n---  \n  \n**Risks Related to Holdings Becoming a Public Company**\n\n**_There can be no assurance that the Holdings Shares will be approved for listing on Nasdaq or any other national securities exchange, or that Holdings will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq or any other national securities exchange._**\n\nIn connection with the Closing, Holdings intends to list the Holdings Shares on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange under the symbol \"HMR”. If, after the Business Combination, Nasdaq delists Holdings’ shares from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards and Holdings is not able to list its shares on another national securities exchange, Holdings expects its shares could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, Holdings and its shareholders could face significant material adverse consequences including:\n\n● | a limited availability of market quotations for Holdings Shares;  \n---|---  \n● | reduced liquidity for Holdings Shares;  \n● | a determination that the Holdings Shares are \"penny stock,” which would require brokers trading the Holdings Shares to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for Holdings Shares;  \n● | a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for Holdings; and  \n● | a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.  \n  \n**_Holdings is an emerging growth company and will therefore be subject to reduced reporting requirements that may make the Holdings Shares less attractive to investors._**\n\nFollowing the consummation of the Business Combination, Holdings will be an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as Holdings continues to be an emerging growth company, it may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \"emerging growth companies,” including exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Further, an emerging growth company’s auditor is exempt from the requirement to communicate critical audit matters in the auditor’s report. Holdings will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (x) during which the fifth anniversary of the effective date of this proxy statement/prospectus occurs, (y) in which Holdings has total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion or (z) in which Holdings is deemed to be a large accelerated filer (which means the market value of Holdings Shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the last Business Day of the second fiscal quarter of that fiscal year), and (ii) the date on which Holdings has issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\n\nIn addition, under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. Holdings may elect to avail itself of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards in the future and, therefore, Holdings would not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\n\nHoldings cannot predict if investors will find Holdings Shares less attractive because Holdings may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find the Holdings Shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for the Holdings Shares and its market price may be more volatile.\n\n**_Holdings will be a \"controlled company” within the meaning of the Nasdaq rules and will be exempt from certain corporate governance requirements as a result._**\n\nImmediately following the completion of the Business Combination, Heidmar Shareholders who are not U.S. persons, will control a majority of the voting power of the outstanding Holdings Shares.\n\nAs a result, Holdings will be a \"controlled company” within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of Nasdaq. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a \"controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:\n\n● | the requirement that a majority of the board of directors of Holdings (the \"Holdings Board”) consist of \"independent directors” as defined under the rules of Nasdaq;  \n---|---  \n● | the requirement that the Holdings Board form a compensation committee composed of at least two independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s responsibilities; and  \n● | the requirement that nominees of the Holdings Board be selected by either (a) independent directors constituting a majority of the Holdings Board’s independent directors or (b) a nominations committee comprised solely of independent directors.  \n  \n13  \n---  \n  \nFollowing the Business Combination, Holdings intends to utilize some or all of these exemptions. As a result, you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq.\n\n**_Holdings will be a \"foreign private issuer” under U.S. securities laws, which exempts it from certain reporting and other obligations and could make the Holdings Shares less attractive to some investors._**\n\nFollowing the Business Combination, Holdings will be a \"foreign private issuer,” as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act”). This means that the information Holdings will be required to publicly disclose will be different from those required of domestic public companies, including the following.\n\n● | Holdings will not have to provide certain information as often or as quickly as domestic filers, including quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K.  \n---|---  \n● | Holdings’ directors, officers and Affiliates (its \"insiders”) will not be subject to the provisions of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act”) requiring disclosure of stock purchases and sales, which means investors will have less information in this regard than they do about MGO or other domestic public companies.  \n● | Holdings’ insiders also won’t be subject to the \"short swing” profit liability in Section 16 of the Exchange Act.  \n● | Holdings will not be subject to the provisions of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, and its proxy statements are not subject to review by the SEC, which means there may be less public information regarding Holdings and its governance than for MGO or other domestic companies.  \n● | Holdings will not be subject to the selective disclosure rules relating to material nonpublic information under Regulation FD.  \n  \nHoldings will be required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the end of each fiscal year. In addition, Holdings intends to publish its results on a quarterly basis through press releases, distributed pursuant to the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. Press releases relating to financial results and material events will also be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K. However, the information Holdings is required to file with or furnish to the SEC will be less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be filed with the SEC by U.S. domestic issuers. As a result, you may not be afforded the same protections or information, which would be made available to you, were you investing in a U.S. domestic issuer. Further, these factors could the Holdings Shares less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm its share price.\n\n**_Holdings is permitted to follow certain \"home country” governance practices in the Marshall Islands rather than the corporate governance requirements of the Nasdaq._**\n\nAs a foreign private issuer, Holdings will have the option to follow certain home country corporate governance practices rather than those of the Nasdaq, provided that Holdings discloses the requirements it is not following and describe the home country practices it is following. Holdings intends to rely on this \"foreign private issuer exemption” with respect to Nasdaq rules requiring shareholder approval. Holdings may in the future elect to follow home country practices with regard to other matters. As a result, Holdings’ shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.\n\n**_Holdings may lose its foreign private issuer status in the future, which could result in significant additional costs and expenses._**\n\nAt the Closing of the Business Combination, Holdings will be a foreign private issuer, which means it will not be required to comply with all of the periodic disclosure and current reporting requirements of the Exchange Act that are applicable to domestic companies. A company’s foreign private issuer status is determined annually on the last Business Day of its most second fiscal quarter, and, accordingly, the next determination will be made with respect to Holdings on June 30, 2025. In the future, Holdings would lose its foreign private issuer status if (a) more than 50% of its outstanding voting securities are owned by U.S. residents and (b) one of the following three things are true: (1) a majority of its directors or executive officers are U.S. citizens or residents, (2) it administers its business principally from the United States or (3) a majority of its assets are located in the United States. If Holdings loses its foreign private issuer status, it would be required to file with the SEC periodic reports and registration statements on U.S. domestic issuer forms, which are more detailed and extensive than the forms available to a foreign private issuer. Holdings would also have to mandatorily comply with U.S. federal proxy requirements, and Holdings’ officers, directors and principal shareholders would become subject to the short-swing profit disclosure and recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. In addition, Holdings would lose its ability to rely upon exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements under the listing rules of the Nasdaq. As a U.S. listed public company that is not a foreign private issuer, Holdings would incur significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses that it would not incur as a foreign private issuer.\n\n14  \n---  \n  \n**_The requirements of being a public company may strain Holdings’ resources, divert Holdings management’s attention and affect Holdings’ ability to attract and retain qualified board members._**\n\nHoldings will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, Nasdaq listing requirements and other applicable securities rules and regulations. As such, Holdings will incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses following the completion of the Business Combination. These expenses may increase even more once Holdings no longer qualifies as an \"emerging growth company.” The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that Holdings file annual and current reports with respect to its business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that Holdings maintains effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Holdings may need to hire more employees post-Business Combination or engage outside consultants to comply with these requirements, which will increase its post-Business Combination costs and expenses.\n\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. Holdings expects these laws and regulations to increase its legal and financial compliance costs after the Business Combination and to render some activities more time-consuming and costly, although Holdings is currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty.\n\nMany members of Holdings’ management team will have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Holdings’ management team may not successfully or efficiently manage the transition to being a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and regulations and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. The need to establish the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert the management’s attention from implementing its growth strategy, which could prevent Holdings from improving its business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, Holdings expects these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for Holdings to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and consequently Holdings may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. These additional obligations could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. These factors could also make it more difficult for Holdings to attract and retain qualified members of its board of directors, particularly to serve on Holdings’ finance and audit committee and nomination and compensation committee, and to attract and retain qualified executive officers.\n\nAs a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, Holdings’ business and financial condition will become more visible, which Holdings believes may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, Holdings’ business and operating results could be adversely affected, and, even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in Holdings’ favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could cause an adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and reputation.\n\n**_Holdings’ failure to timely and effectively implement controls and procedures required by Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that will be applicable to it after the Closing could have a material adverse effect on its business._**\n\nHeidmar is currently not subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. However, following the Closing, Holdings will be required to provide management’s attestation on internal controls. The standards required for a public company under Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are significantly more stringent than those required of Heidmar as a privately-held company. Management may not be able to effectively and timely implement controls and procedures that adequately respond to the increased regulatory compliance and reporting requirements that will be applicable after the Business Combination. If Holdings is not able to implement the additional requirements of Section 404(a) in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, it may not be able to assess whether its internal controls over financial reporting are effective, which may subject it to adverse regulatory consequences and could harm investor confidence and the market price of its securities.\n\n15  \n---  \n  \n**Risks Related to the Holdings Shares**\n\n**_Upon completion of the Business Combination, MGO Stockholders will become shareholders of Holdings, and the market price for the Holdings Shares may be affected by factors different from those that historically have affected MGO._**\n\nUpon completion of the Business Combination, MGO Stockholders will become shareholders of Holdings. Holdings’ business differs from that of MGO, and, accordingly, the results of operations of Holdings will be affected by some factors that are different from those currently affecting the results of operations of MGO. Holdings is a holding company incorporated in the Marshall Islands, and, after the consummation of the Business Combination, will have as its direct subsidiaries MGO and Heidmar. Heidmar is engaged in tanker pooling, commercial and asset management, and time charters, businesses quite distinct from those that MGO currently operates. Holdings’ business and results of operations will, therefore, be affected by operating, industry and regional risks to which MGO is not currently exposed.\n\n**_Future sales of Holdings Shares, including resales by the Heidmar Shareholders and other significant shareholders, may cause the market price of the Holdings Shares to drop significantly, even if Holdings’ business is doing well._**\n\nUnder the Business Combination Agreement, after the Closing, it is anticipated that existing Heidmar Shareholders will hold 94.34% of Holdings (including amounts to be distributed to MGO’s financial advisor) and the former MGO stockholders will hold 5.66% of Holdings, without taking into account the issuance of any Earnout Shares. All of these Holdings Shares will be issued to these holders pursuant to the registration statement that Holdings will file in connection with the Business Combination, and therefore will be freely tradable by their holders, subject in certain cases to the restrictions applicable to \"control securities” under U.S. securities laws. The Holdings Shares held by the Heidmar Shareholders and the MGO Principals will also be subject to lock-up/leak-out agreements between these holders and Holdings, pursuant to which the Heidmar Shareholders, and the MGO Principals will be restricted from transferring their shares for four months after the Closing and have limits on the number of shares they may sell during the fifth and sixth month after the Closing, subject to certain customary exceptions.\n\nThe sale by these holders of substantial quantities of Holdings Shares, or the market’s perception that such a sale is pending, could cause a significant decrease in the price of the Holdings Shares. This could occur as the expiration of the lock-up or leak-out periods approach, upon an announcement of the waiver of the lock-up/leak-out restrictions applicable to some or all of the shares or for other reasons. Any of these could have the effect of increasing the volatility in, or putting significant downward pressure on, the price of Holdings Shares.\n\nIn addition, Holdings could seek to issue new Holdings Shares for sale or as consideration for an acquisition, which could also cause the market price of Holdings Shares to decline or impair Holdings’ ability to raise capital through a future sale of, or pay for acquisitions using, Holdings’ equity securities.\n\n**_The future exercise of registration rights may adversely affect the market price of Holdings’ securities._**\n\nIn connection with the Transactions Holdings will enter into a Registration Rights Agreement with the Heidmar Shareholders (each, a \"Holder”). Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, Holdings has agreed to file a Registration Statement with the SEC for the resale by the Holders from time-to-time of their Holdings Shares. The Holders will also be entitled to demand that Holdings engage in an underwritten offering of their Holdings Shares and will also have certain \"piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed for other offerings by Holdings. The presence of these additional Holdings Shares trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of Holdings’ securities.\n\n**_The market price of Holdings Shares may be volatile, and you may lose all or part of your investment._**\n\nImmediately following completion of the Business Combination and the other transactions, Holdings will have outstanding shares that will be freely tradable without restriction. Sales by Holdings or Holdings’ shareholders of a substantial number of Holdings Shares, the issuance of Holdings Shares as consideration for acquisitions, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of the Holdings Shares to decline or could impair Holdings’ ability to raise capital through a future sale of, or pay for acquisitions using, Holdings’ equity securities.\n\nThe market price of the Holdings Shares may be volatile, because of actual and perceived changes specific events regarding Holdings’ business, financial performance and prospects, general economic events and conditions, and general volatility in the stock market. The factors that could cause fluctuations in Holdings’ share price may include, among other factors (including those discussed in this \"Risk Factors” section) the following:\n\n● | actual or anticipated fluctuations in Holdings’ results of operations;  \n---|---  \n● | variance in Holdings’ financial performance from the expectations of market analysts or others;  \n  \n16  \n---  \n  \n● | announcements by Holdings or Holdings’ competitors of significant business developments, changes in significant customers, acquisitions or expansion plans;  \n---|---  \n● | Holdings’ involvement in litigation;  \n● | Holdings’ sale of Holdings Shares or other securities in the future;  \n● | market conditions in Holdings’ industry;  \n● | changes in key personnel;  \n● | the trading volume of Holdings’ Common Shares;  \n● | the sale of a substantial number of Holdings Shares by Holdings or its shareholders, or the perception that such a sale may occur;  \n● | changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of Holdings’ markets; and  \n● | general economic and market conditions.  \n  \nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of the Holdings Shares, regardless of Holdings’ operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company. If Holdings was involved in any similar litigation, Holdings could incur substantial costs and Holdings’ management’s attention and resources could be diverted.\n\n**_Volatility in Holdings’ share price could subject Holdings to securities class action litigation._**\n\nThe market price of the Holdings Shares may be volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their shares have been subject to securities class action litigation. Holdings may be the target of this type of litigation and investigations. Securities litigation against Holdings could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm Holdings’ business.\n\n**_An active trading market for the Holdings Shares may not be sustained to provide adequate liquidity._**\n\nAn active trading market may not be sustained for Holdings Shares. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. An inactive market may also impair Holdings’ ability to raise capital by selling Holdings Shares and may impair Holdings’ ability to acquire other companies by using Holdings’ shares as consideration.\n\n**_Holdings is a holding company that depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute funds to it in order to satisfy its financial and other obligations._**\n\nHoldings is a holding company that has no significant assets other than cash and the equity of its subsidiaries. Holdings’ ability to pay dividends and fulfill respective financial obligations depends on the performance of its subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to Holdings. The ability of Holdings’ subsidiaries to make these distributions may become subject to restrictions contained in those subsidiaries’ financing agreements and could be affected by a claim or other action by a third party, including a creditor, or by Marshall Islands law which regulates the payment of dividends by companies. If Holdings is unable to obtain sufficient funds from its subsidiaries to satisfy future liquidity requirements and/or to finance future operations or if for other reasons its subsidiaries are unable to upstream funds to it, Holdings may not be able to pay dividends.\n\n**_Holdings’ ability to pay dividends is subject to limitations and risks that could cause those dividends to be lower than expected or to not be paid at all._**\n\nHoldings has never declared or paid any dividends on the Holdings Shares. Heidmar, which will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings immediately following the Closing, paid an aggregate of $25 million in dividends in 2023 and did not pay any dividends in 2022. Heidmar has not yet paid any dividends in 2024, however the Business Combination Agreement requires Heidmar to have at least $10 million of cash and accounts receivable at Closing, and Heidmar expects to pay a dividend to the Heidmar Shareholders prior to Closing equal to its cash and accounts receivable in excess of that amount.\n\nAny payment of any dividends by Holdings will be subject to certain limitations and qualifications including that:\n\n● | Holdings intends to pay any dividends from its operating surplus, less amounts it retains to fund its expansion, for debt repayment and for other corporate purposes, as determined by Holdings’ management and board of directors;  \n---|---  \n● | the declaration and payment of dividends will be subject at all times to the discretion of the Holdings Board;  \n  \n17  \n---  \n  \n● | the timing and amount of dividends will depend on Holdings’ earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and availability, fleet renewal and expansion, restrictions in its loan agreements, the provisions of Marshall Islands law affecting the payment of dividends and other factors; and  \n---|---  \n● | the requirements of Marshall Islands law, which generally prohibits the payment of dividends other than from surplus, while a company is insolvent, or if it would be rendered insolvent upon the payment of such dividends, or if there is no surplus, dividends may be declared or paid out of net income for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared, and for the preceding fiscal year.  \n  \nIn addition, Holdings’ ability to pay any dividends is subject to and can be diminished by the risks set forth in this \"_Risk Factors_ ” section, any of which could result in Holdings being unable to pay its expected dividends or any dividends at all. If Holdings fails to pay dividends at the expected rate, the value of Holdings Shares will decrease, and you could lose some or all of your investment.\n\n**_Investors may suffer adverse tax consequences in connection with the acquisition, ownership and disposal of the Holdings Shares._**\n\nThe tax consequences in connection with the acquisition, ownership and disposal of the Holdings Shares may differ from the tax consequences in connection with the acquisition, ownership and disposal of securities in another entity and may also differ depending on such an investor’s respective circumstances including, without limitation, where such an investor is a tax resident. Any such tax consequences could be materially adverse to such an investor and therefore, such an investor should seek its own tax advice in respect of the tax consequences in connection with the acquisition, ownership and disposal of the Holdings Shares.\n\n**_The number of issued Holdings Shares may fluctuate substantially, which could lead to adverse tax consequences for the holders thereof._**\n\nIt may be that the number of issued and outstanding Holdings Shares fluctuates substantially. This may have an impact on interests and certain thresholds that are relevant for investors’ tax purposes and positions, also dependent on their respective circumstances. The potential tax consequences in this regard could potentially be material, and therefore, investors should seek their own tax advice with respect to the tax consequences in connection with the acquisition, ownership and disposal of the Holdings Shares.\n\n**_If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about Holdings’ business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding Holdings Shares, the market price and trading volume of Holdings Shares could decline._**\n\nThe trading market for Holdings Shares will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about Holdings or Holdings’ business. Holdings does not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no or few securities or industry analysts commence coverage of Holdings, the trading price for Holdings Shares would be negatively impacted. In the event Holdings obtains securities or industry analyst coverage, if any of the analysts who cover Holdings issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding Holdings, Holdings’ business model, Holdings’ intellectual property or Holdings’ stock performance, or if Holdings’ results of operations fail to meet the expectations of analysts, Holdings’ stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of Holdings or fail to publish reports on Holdings regularly, Holdings could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause Holdings’ stock price or trading volume to decline.\n\n**_Investor confidence and the market price of Holdings’ shares may be adversely impacted if Holdings’ management is unable to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting._**\n\nHoldings will become a U.S. public company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC”), following the completion of the Business Combination. SEC rules require a public company, to include a report from management of its internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting in that company’s annual report on Form 10-K or Form 20-F that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. This requirement will first apply to Holdings’ annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2024. In addition, independent registered public accountants of a public company must report on the effectiveness of that company’s internal controls over financial reporting after that company loses emerging growth company status and has met accelerated filer status. Holdings’ management may not conclude that its internal controls over financial reporting are effective. Moreover, even if Holdings’ management does conclude that its internal controls over financial reporting are effective, if its independent registered public accountants are not satisfied with its internal control structure and procedures, the level at which its internal controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if the independent registered public accountants interpret the requirements, rules or regulations differently from Holdings’ management, they may not concur with its management’s assessment or may not issue a report that is unqualified. Any of these outcomes could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of Holdings’ financial statements, which could lead to a decline in the market price of its shares. Further, the total cost of Holdings’ initial compliance and the future ongoing costs of complying with U.S. public company requirements will be substantial.\n\n18  \n---  \n  \n**_Currently, there is no public market for the Holdings Shares. MGO Stockholders cannot be sure that an active trading market will develop for the Holdings Shares, the market price they will receive or that Holdings will successfully obtain authorization for listing on the Nasdaq._**\n\nAs part of the Business Combination, each issued and outstanding MGO Share will be converted into the right to receive one Holdings Common Share. Holdings is a newly formed entity, and prior to this transaction it has not issued any securities in the U.S. markets or elsewhere. Further, extensive information about Holdings, its businesses or its operations has not previously been publicly available. MGO and Holdings have agreed to cause the Holdings Shares to be issued in the Business Combination to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq prior to the effective time of the Business Combination. However, the listing of shares on the Nasdaq does not ensure that a market for the Holdings Shares will develop or the price at which the shares will trade. No assurance can be provided as to the demand for or trading price of the Holdings Shares following the Closing and the Holdings Shares may trade at a price less than the current market price of the MGO Shares.\n\nEven if Holdings is successful in developing a public market, there may not be enough liquidity to enable shareholders to sell their common shares. If a public market for the Holdings Shares does not develop, investors may not be able to re-sell their common shares, rendering their shares illiquid and possibly resulting in a complete loss of their investment. Holdings cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in Holdings will lead to the development of an active, liquid trading market. The trading price of and demand for the Holdings Shares following completion of the Business Combination and the development and continued existence of a market and favorable price for the Holdings Shares will depend on a number of conditions, including the development of a market following, including by analysts and other investment professionals, the businesses, operations, results and prospects of Holdings, general market and economic conditions, governmental actions, regulatory considerations, legal proceedings and developments or other factors. These and other factors may impair the development of a liquid market and the ability of investors to sell shares at an attractive price. These factors also could cause the market price and demand for the Holdings Shares to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares and may otherwise affect negatively the price and liquidity of the Holdings Shares. Many of these factors and conditions are beyond the control of Holdings or Holdings shareholders.\n\n**_Recent market volatility could impact the share price and trading volume of Holdings’ securities._**\n\nThe trading market for Holdings’ securities could be impacted by recent market volatility. Recent stock run-ups, divergences in valuation ratios relative to those seen during traditional markets, high short interest or short squeezes, and strong and atypical retail investor interest in the markets may impact the demand for Holdings Shares.\n\nA possible \"short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand of Holdings Shares that largely exceeds supply may lead to price volatility in Holdings Shares. Investors may purchase Holdings Shares to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of the Holdings Shares, which may involve both long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of Holdings Shares available for purchase, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase Holdings Shares for delivery to lenders. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of the Holdings Shares. This is often referred to as a \"short squeeze.” A short squeeze could lead to volatile price movements in the Holdings Shares that are not directly correlated to the operating performance of Holdings.\n\n**_If the Holdings Shares are not eligible for deposit and clearing within the facilities of the Depository Trust Company, then Transactions in the Holdings Shares may be disrupted._**\n\nThe facilities of the Depository Trust Company (\"DTC”) are a widely used mechanism that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in the DTC system, which include many large banks and brokerage firms. Holdings expects that Holdings Shares will be eligible for deposit and clearing within the DTC system. Holdings expects to enter into arrangements with DTC whereby it will agree to indemnify DTC for stamp duty that may be assessed upon it as a result of its service as a depository and clearing agency for the Holdings Shares. Holdings expects these actions, among others, will result in DTC agreeing to accept the Holdings Shares for deposit and clearing within its facilities.\n\nDTC is not obligated to accept Holdings Shares for deposit and clearing within its facilities in connection with the listing and, even if DTC does initially accept Holdings Shares, it will generally have discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agency for Holdings Shares.\n\n19  \n---  \n  \nIf DTC determines at any time after the completion of the Transactions and the listing that the Holdings Shares were not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities, then Holdings believes the Holdings Shares would not be eligible for continued listing on a U.S. securities exchange and trading in the shares would be disrupted. While Holdings would pursue alternative arrangements to preserve its listing and maintain trading, any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Holdings Shares.\n\n**Risks Related to MGO’s Business and Industry**\n\n**_We have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful._**\n\nThe Company has a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of its business and prospects. The Company is subject to all the risks inherent in a small company seeking to develop, market and distribute new services, particularly companies in evolving markets such as the Internet, digital technology and payment systems. The likelihood of the Company’s success must be considered, in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the development, introduction, marketing and distribution of new products and services in a competitive environment.\n\nSuch risks for the Company include, but are not limited to, dependence on the success and acceptance of the Company’s products, the ability to attract and retain a suitable client base and the management of growth. To address these risks, the Company must, among other things, generate increased demand; attract a sufficient customer base; respond to competitive developments; successfully introduce new products; attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel and upgrade and enhance the Company’s technologies to accommodate expanded service offerings. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of the Company’s business and its limited operating history, the Company believes that period-to-period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\n\nThe Company is therefore subject to many of the risks common to early-stage enterprises, including under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financial and other resources and lack of revenues.\n\n**_We have a history of operating losses and may continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future._**\n\nWe recorded a net loss attributable to MGO stockholders of $7,143,404 as of December 31, 2023 and a net loss attributable to MGO stockholders of $2,582,946 as of December 31, 2022. We also recorded a net loss attributable to MGO stockholders of $2,636,296 as of June 30, 2024. We cannot anticipate when, if ever, our operations will become profitable. We expect to incur significant net losses as we develop our business and pursue our business strategy. We intend to invest significantly in our business before we expect cash flow from operations to be adequate to cover our operating expenses. If we are unable to execute our business strategy and grow our business, for any reason, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\n\nThe Company is attempting to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Company’s cash position may not be sufficient to support its operations. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds by the sale of its equity, there can be no assurances to that effect.\n\n**_Our business depends on our ability to maintain a strong community around the Stand Flagpole brand with engaged customers and influencers. We may not be able to maintain and enhance our existing brand communities if we receive customer complaints, negative publicity or otherwise fail to live up to consumers’ expectations, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations._**\n\nWe believe that maintaining our brand images, particularly with our core target customers, is important to maintaining and expanding our customer base and sales. Maintaining and enhancing our brand images may require us to make additional investments in areas such as merchandising, marketing, online operations, online displays and other promotions, and employee training. These investments may be substantial and may not ultimately be successful. If we are unable to maintain or enhance our brand image, brand awareness and reputation, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\n\n20  \n---  \n  \nOver the course of 2023, our ability to successfully market our curated flagpole and flagpole accessories, offered through _www.StandFlagpoles.com,_ has been dependent on identifying and accessing our target audience of customers, namely active military and military veterans, as well as American homeowners who desire to display a symbol of their patriotism and political affiliations.\n\nA significant portion of our customers’ experience with our brands depends on third parties outside of our control, including suppliers and logistics providers, such as UPS, DHL and the U.S. Postal Service. If these third parties do not meet our or our customers’ expectations or if they increase their rates, our business may suffer irreparable damage, or our costs may increase. In addition, establishing, maintaining and enhancing relationships with other third-party brands may require us to make substantial investments, and these investments may not be successful. Also, if we fail to promote and maintain our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. We anticipate that, as the markets for our branded product lines become increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brands may become increasingly difficult and expensive.\n\nCustomer complaints or negative publicity about our websites or mobile apps, products, merchandise quality, product delivery times, customer data handling, security practices or customer support, especially on social media, blogs and in reviews, could rapidly and severely diminish consumer use of our websites or mobile apps and customer and supplier confidence in us, and result in harm to our brand. We believe that much of the growth in our customer bases to date has originated from word-of-mouth, including social media and our influencer-driven marketing strategy. If we are not able to develop and maintain positive relationships with our network of influencers or our online customer community, our ability to promote and maintain or enhance awareness of the _Stand Flagpoles_ brand and leverage social media platforms to drive visits to _www.standflagpoles.com_ may be adversely affected.\n\n**_We may be unable to maintain a high level of engagement with our customers and increase their spending with us, which could harm our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations._**\n\nA portion of our net revenue comes from repeat purchases by existing customers, especially those existing customers who are highly engaged and purchase a significant amount of merchandise from us. If existing customers no longer find our merchandise appealing, they may make fewer purchases and may stop shopping with us. Even if our existing customers find our merchandise appealing, if customer buying preferences change, they may decide to purchase less merchandise over time. Additionally, if customers who purchase a significant amount of merchandise from us were to make fewer purchases or stop shopping with us, then our sales may decline. A decrease in the number of our customers or a decrease in their spending on the merchandise we offer could negatively impact our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. Further, we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to increase sales to our existing customers over time and, if we are unable to do so, our business may suffer.\n\n**_Our success depends on our ability to anticipate, identify, measure and respond quickly to new and rapidly changing market trends, customer preferences and demands and other factors._**\n\nOur core market for flagpoles and related ancillary products are subject to new and rapidly changing market trends, constantly evolving consumer preferences and demands, and preserving brand loyalty. Accordingly, our success is dependent on our ability to anticipate, identify, measure and respond to the latest trends and customer demands, and to translate such trends and demands into appropriate, desirable product offerings in a timely manner. A select team of our employees is primarily responsible for performing this analysis and making initial product decisions, and they rely on feedback on trends from a variety of sources, which may not accurately predict evolving trends. Our failure to anticipate, identify or react swiftly and appropriately to new and changing trends or desired customer preferences, or to accurately anticipate and forecast demand for certain product offerings, is likely to lead to lower demand for our merchandise, which could cause, among other things, sales declines, excess inventories, a greater number of markdowns and lower margins. Further, if we are not able to anticipate, identify and respond to changing trends and customer preferences, we may lose customers and market share to our competitors who may be able to better anticipate, identify and respond to such trends and preferences. In addition, because our success depends on our brand images, our business could be materially adversely affected if new product offerings are not accepted by our customers. We cannot assure investors that our new product offerings will be met with the same level of acceptance as our past product offerings or that we will be able to adequately respond to market trends or the preferences of our customers in a timely manner or at all. If we do not accurately anticipate, identify, forecast or analyze trends and sales levels, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\n\n21  \n---  \n  \n**_Our business depends on effective marketing and high customer traffic._**\n\nWe have many initiatives in our marketing programs particularly with regard to our websites, mobile applications and our social media presence. If our competitors increase their spending on marketing, if our marketing expenses increase, if our marketing becomes less effective than that of our competitors, or if we do not adequately leverage technology and data analytics capabilities needed to generate concise competitive insight, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Among other factors, (1) a failure to sufficiently innovate or maintain effective marketing strategies and (2) U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that make it more difficult or costly to digitally market, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\"CCPA”), may adversely impact our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales.\n\n**_We rely on third parties to drive traffic to our platform, and these providers may change their algorithms or pricing in ways that could negatively affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations._**\n\nOur success depends on our ability to attract customers cost effectively. With respect to our marketing channels, we rely heavily on relationships with providers of online services, search engines, social media, directories and other websites and e-commerce businesses to provide content, advertising banners and other links that direct customers to our websites. We rely on these relationships to provide significant traffic to our website. In particular, we rely on digital platforms, such as Instagram, Google and Facebook, as important marketing channels. Digital channels change their algorithms periodically, and our rankings in organic searches and visibility in social media feeds may be adversely affected by those changes, as has occurred from time to time, requiring us to increase our spending on paid marketing to offset the loss in traffic. Search engine companies may also determine that we are not in compliance with their guidelines and consequently penalize us in their algorithms as a result. Even with an increase in marketing spend to offset any loss in search engine optimization traffic as a result of algorithm changes, the recovery period in organic traffic may span multiple quarters or years. If digital platforms change or penalize us with their algorithms, terms of service, display and featuring of search results, or if competition increases for advertisements, we may be unable to cost-effectively attract customers.\n\nOur relationships with digital platforms are not covered by long-term contractual agreements and do not require any specific performance commitments. In addition, many of the platforms and agencies with whom we have advertising arrangements provide advertising services to other companies, including retailers with whom we compete. As competition for online advertising has increased, the cost for some of these services has also increased. A significant increase in the cost of the marketing providers upon which we rely could adversely impact our ability to attract customers cost effectively and harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n**_Use of social media, influencers, affiliate marketing, email, text messages and direct mail may adversely impact our brand and reputation or subject us to fines or other penalties._**\n\nWe use social media, including Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Weibo, as well as affiliate marketing, email, SMS, and direct mail as part of our multi-channel approach to marketing, and we encourage our customers to use social media while shopping. In the future, we may also elect to establish relationships with social media influencers, who may serve as our brand ambassadors, and engage in sponsorship initiatives. Laws and regulations governing the use of these platforms and other digital marketing channels are rapidly evolving. It may become more difficult for us or our partners to comply with such laws, and future data privacy laws and regulations or industry standards may restrict or limit our ability to use some or all of the marketing strategies on which we currently rely. The failure by us, our employees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms could adversely impact our reputation or subject us to fines or other penalties. In addition, our employees or third parties acting at our direction may knowingly or inadvertently make use of social media in ways that could lead to the loss or infringement of intellectual property, as well as the public disclosure of proprietary, confidential or sensitive personal information of our business, employees, customers or others. Any such inappropriate use of social media tools could also cause business interruptions and reputational damage.\n\nCustomers value readily available information concerning retailers and their goods and services and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy. Information concerning us, whether accurate or not, may be posted on social media platforms at any time and may have a disproportionately adverse impact on our brand, reputation or business. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, an increase in the use of social media for product promotion and marketing may cause an increase in the burden on us to monitor compliance of such materials and increase the risk that such materials could contain problematic product or marketing claims in violation of applicable regulations. For example, in some cases, the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC”) has sought enforcement action where an endorsement has failed to clearly and conspicuously disclose a financial relationship between an influencer and an advertiser.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \nNegative commentary regarding us, our products or potential influencers and other third parties who are affiliated with us may also be posted on social media platforms and may be adverse to our reputation or business. Influencers with whom we may establish relationships could engage in behavior or use their platforms to communicate directly with our customers in a manner that reflects poorly on our brand and may be attributed to us or otherwise adversely affect us. It is not possible to prevent such behavior, and the precautions we take to detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Our target customers often value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy. The harm may be immediate, without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.\n\n**_We have not historically used traditional advertising channels, and if we become unable to continue to connect with our target customer bases, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**\n\nWe utilize organic content, email, SMS, direct mail, paid search and social media marketing to capture the interest of our customers and drive them to our platform. We historically have not used traditional advertising channels, such as newspapers, magazines and television, which are used by some of our competitors. In the future, we expect to increase our use of social media, such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Weibo for marketing purposes. If our marketing efforts are not successful, there may be no immediately available or cost-effective alternative marketing channel for us to use to build or maintain brand awareness. As we execute our growth strategy, our ability to successfully integrate into our target customers’ communities or to expand into new markets will be dependent on our ability to connect with our target customers through our established marketing channels. Failure to successfully connect with our target customers in new and existing markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n**_We may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy._**\n\nOur future growth, profitability and cash flows depend upon our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, which, in turn, is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\n● | grow awareness of our brands and attract new customers;  \n---|---  \n● | enhance and retain our existing customer relationships;  \n● | pursue category expansions; and  \n● | pursue deeper international expansion.  \n  \nWe cannot ensure that we can successfully achieve any or all of the above initiatives in the manner or time period that we expect. Further, achieving these objectives will require investments which may result in short-term costs without generating any net revenue and, therefore, may be dilutive to our earnings. We cannot provide any assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits we expect our strategy will achieve. The failure to realize those benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n**_Our growth plan contemplates expansion into new markets, and our efforts to expand may ultimately be unsuccessful._**\n\nOur growth plan includes introducing our brands globally, including in countries and regions where we have no or limited operating experience. Expanding into new countries and regions involves significant risk, particularly if we have no experience in marketing, selling and engaging with customers in the market. For example, there is no guarantee that the success of a brand in the United Kingdom will translate to the success of that brand in other countries, such as the United States. Our efforts to expand into new countries and regions could fail for many reasons, including our failure to accurately or timely identify apparel trends in new markets, different consumer demand dynamics and lack of acceptance of new offerings by existing or new users, our failure to promote the new markets effectively, or negative publicity about us or our new markets. In addition, these initiatives may not drive increases in revenue, may require substantial investment and planning, and may bring us more directly into competition with companies that are better established, operate more effectively or have greater resources than we do. There is additional complexity associated with local laws, tariffs and shipping logistics in new countries where our brands do not have an established presence. Expanding into new markets will require additional investment of time and resources of our management and personnel. If we are unable to cost-effectively expand into new countries and regions, then our growth prospects and competitive position may be harmed and our business, results of operations and financial condition may suffer.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \n**_We face risks from our international business._**\n\nOur current growth strategy includes plans to expand our digital marketing and grow our e-commerce and retail presence internationally over the next several years. As we seek to expand internationally, we face competition from more established retail competitors. Consumer demand and behavior, as well as cultural differences, tastes and purchasing trends, may differ, and as a result, sales of our merchandise may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with our expectations. Our ability to conduct business internationally may be adversely impacted by political, economic and public health events (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), as well as the global economy. Any challenges that we encounter as we expand internationally may divert financial, operational and managerial resources from our existing operations, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, we are increasingly exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our revenue, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\n\n**_We rely on consumer discretionary spending and may be adversely affected by economic downturns and other macroeconomic conditions or trends._**\n\nOur business and results of operations are subject to global economic conditions and their impact on consumer discretionary spending. Customer purchases of discretionary retail items and specialty retail products, which include apparel, accessories and homewares, may be adversely affected by economic conditions such as employment levels, salary and wage levels, the availability of customer credit, inflation, high interest rates, high tax rates, high fuel prices and customer confidence with respect to current and future economic conditions. Customer purchases may decline during recessionary periods or at other times when unemployment is higher, fuel prices are higher or disposable income is lower. These risks may be exacerbated for retailers like us that focus significantly on selling discretionary fashion merchandise to customers who seek value. Customer willingness to make discretionary purchases may decline, may stall or may be slow to increase due to national and regional economic conditions.\n\nOur sales may be particularly susceptible to economic and other conditions in certain regions or states. Considerable uncertainty and volatility remain in the national and global economy, and any further or future slowdowns or disruptions in the economy could adversely affect online shopping traffic and customer discretionary spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to maintain our recent rate of growth in net revenue if there is a decline in customer spending.\n\n**_We have been adversely affected by the effects of inflation and a potential recession._**\n\nInflation has adversely affected our liquidity, business, financial condition, and results of operations by increasing our overall cost structure and such affects will be further exacerbated if we are unable to achieve commensurate increases in the prices we charge our customers. The existence of inflation in the economy has resulted in, and may continue to result in, higher interest rates and capital costs, shipping costs, supply shortages, increased costs of labor, weakening exchange rates, and other similar effects. As a result of inflation, we have experienced and may continue to experience, cost increases. In addition, poor economic and market conditions, including a potential recession, may negatively impact market sentiment, decreasing the demand for sportswear and outerwear, which would adversely affect our operating income and results of operations. If we are unable to take effective measures in a timely manner to mitigate the impact of inflation, as well as a potential recession, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n**_Merchandise returns could harm our business._**\n\nWe allow our customers to return merchandise, subject to our return policy. If merchandise return economics become more costly, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. Further, we may modify our policies relating to returns from time to time, which may result in customer dissatisfaction or an increase in the number of merchandise returns. Supplier non-compliance can also result in increased returns. From time to time our products are damaged in transit, which can increase return rates and harm our brand. Competitive pressures could cause us to alter our return policies or our shipping policies, which could result in an increase in damaged products and an increase in merchandise returns.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \n**_If new trade restrictions are imposed or existing trade restrictions become more burdensome, our ability to source imported merchandise efficiently and cost effectively could be materially adversely affected._**\n\nWe purchase a portion of our inventory from foreign manufacturers, including those based in China, which is either directly imported by us from foreign suppliers or imported by domestic importers. Suppliers, to the extent they obtain merchandise from outside of the United States, are subject to trade restrictions, including tariffs, safeguards, or quotas, changes to which could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us. Under the World Trade Organization Agreement, effective January 1, 2005, the United States and other World Trade Organization member countries removed quotas on goods from World Trade Organization members, which in certain instances we believe affords our suppliers greater flexibility in importing textile and apparel products from World Trade Organization countries from which they source our merchandise. However, as the removal of quotas resulted in an import surge from China, the United States imposed safeguard quotas on a number of categories of goods and apparel from China and may impose additional quotas in the future. These and other trade restrictions could have a significant impact on our suppliers’ sourcing patterns in the future. The extent of this impact, if any, and the possible effect on our purchasing patterns and costs, cannot be determined at this time. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our suppliers’ merchandise is currently manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States or foreign governments, nor can we predict the likelihood, type or effect of any restrictions. Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards and customs restrictions against items we offer, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise to our suppliers; and we would expect the costs to be passed along in increased prices to us, which we may be unable to pass on to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n**_Our direct-to-consumer business model is subject to risks that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations._**\n\nWe sell merchandise direct-to-consumer through our online sites and mobile app. Our direct-to-consumer business model is subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results. Risks include, but are not limited to, (i) resellers purchasing private label and exclusive merchandise and reselling it outside of authorized distribution channels; (ii) failure of the systems that operate our ecommerce websites and their related support systems, including computer viruses; (iii) theft of customer information, privacy concerns, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions; (iv) credit card fraud; and (v) risks related to our supply chain and fulfillment operations. Risks specific to operating an ecommerce business also include (i) the ability to optimize the online experience and direct e-commerce channels to consumer needs, (ii) liability for copyright and trademark infringement, (iii) changing patterns of consumer behavior and (iv) competition from other ecommerce and brick-and-mortar retailers. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect our sales, as well as damage our reputation and brands.\n\n**_Our brands depend on the promotion of diversity and equality from an ethically and sustainably-sourced supply chain. If we are unable to do so, damage to our brands and reputation could result or failure to expand our brands could harm our business and results of operations._**\n\nOur customers and employees are increasingly focused on environmental, social and sustainability practices. We will depend significantly on building and maintaining our brands and reputation for promoting diversity and equality from an ethically- and sustainably sourced supply chain to attract customers and employees and grow our business. If we are unable to, for instance, prioritize transparency among our employees, appropriately enforce fair labor practices, obtain our materials from ethical and sustainable suppliers or reduce waste, our brands and reputation could be significantly impaired, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Customer values could shift faster than we are able to adjust our merchandise proposition.\n\n**_We could be required to collect additional sales taxes or be subject to other tax liabilities that may increase the costs our consumers would have to pay for our offering and adversely affect our operating results._**\n\nIn general, we have not historically collected state or local sales, use or other similar taxes in any jurisdictions in which we do not have a tax nexus, in reliance on court decisions or applicable exemptions that restrict or preclude the imposition of obligations to collect such taxes with respect to online sales of our products. In addition, we have not historically collected state or local sales, use or other similar taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we do have a physical presence, in reliance on applicable exemptions. On June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court decided, in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., that state and local jurisdictions may, at least in certain circumstances, enforce a sales and use tax collection obligation on remote vendors that have no physical presence in such jurisdiction. A number of states have already begun, or have positioned themselves to begin, requiring sales and use tax collection by remote vendors and/or by online marketplaces. The details and effective dates of these collection requirements vary from state to state. While we now collect, remit and report sales tax in all states that impose a sales tax, it is still possible that one or more jurisdictions may assert that we have liability for previous periods for which we did not collect sales, use or other similar taxes; and if such an assertion or assertions were successful, it could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales taxes and penalties and interest, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n25  \n---  \n  \n**_We do not have our own warehouse or distribution facilities but rely on a sole third-party logistics providers responsible for warehousing and fulfilling our orders. If our third-party providers experience disruptions to the operation of its distribution centers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**\n\nWhile we expanded our 3PL support services in 2023 through our partnership with a U.S.-based order fulfillment and inventory warehousing company with deep expertise in digital commerce, we have also relied on an international logistics company serving many renowned brands across global consumer goods industries for warehousing and fulfillment of our orders. This provider has distribution centers in Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom and the United States and has a capacity to process more than 300 million pieces of merchandise annually and distribute over 20 million packages through retail, wholesale and ecommerce sales channels. All of our merchandise is shipped from our suppliers to one of our providers’ distribution facilities and then packaged and shipped from these distribution facilities to our customers. The success of our business depends on our timely receipt of merchandise so we can continuously bring new, on-trend products online for sale. The success of our business also depends on customer orders being timely processed and delivered to meet promised delivery dates and satisfy our customers. The efficient flow of our merchandise requires that we have adequate capacity and uninterrupted service in our distribution facilities to support both our current level of operations and the anticipated increased levels that may follow from our growth plans. In order to accommodate future growth, we will either need to expand and upgrade distribution facilities with our existing provider or engage additional providers. Upgrading our existing arrangement or transferring our operations to another third-party provider with greater capacity will require us to incur additional costs, which could be significant, and may require us to obtain additional financing. Our failure to provide adequate order fulfillment, secure additional distribution capacity when necessary or retain a suitable third-party logistics provider could impede our growth plans. Further increasing this capacity could increase our costs, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, if our current providers encounter difficulties associated with their distribution facilities or if they were to shut down or be unable to operate for any reason, including because of fire, natural disaster, power outage or other event, we could face inventory shortages, resulting in \"out-of-stock” conditions on our website, and delays in shipments, resulting in significantly higher costs and longer lead times distributing our merchandise.\n\n**_Because we operate in an evolving industry, our past results may not be indicative of future performance, and our future performance may fluctuate materially, which will increase your investment risk._**\n\nWe operate in a rapidly evolving industry that may not develop as expected, if at all. Although we have experienced significant growth in net sales and the number of our active customers, it may be difficult to assess our future prospects. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we may encounter. These risks and difficulties include our ability to, among other things: acquire new customers who purchase products from us at the same rate and of the same type as existing customers; retain our existing customers and have them continue to purchase products from us at rates and methods consistent with their prior purchasing behavior; encourage customers to expand the categories of products they purchase from us; attract new brand partners so that we may offer a broader range of quality products to our customers at attractive prices; retain our existing brand partners and offer additional quality products to our customers at attractive prices; increase brand awareness; provide our customers with superior customer support; fulfill and deliver orders in a timely way and in accordance with customer expectations, which may change over time; respond to changes in consumer access to and use of the Internet and mobile devices; react to challenges from existing and new competitors; avoid interruptions or disruptions in our business; develop and maintain a scalable, high-performance technology and fulfillment infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably handle increased usage, as well as the deployment of new features and the sale of new products and services; respond to macroeconomic trends; and hire, integrate and retain qualified personnel.\n\n26  \n---  \n  \n**_If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed._**\n\nTo effectively manage our growth, we must continue to implement our operational plans and strategies, improve and expand our infrastructure of people and information systems and expand, train and manage our employee and contractor base. We have increased employee and contractor headcount since our inception to support the growth in our business, and we intend for this growth to continue for the foreseeable future. To support continued growth, we must effectively integrate, develop and motivate new employees, while maintaining our corporate culture. We face competition for qualified personnel. Additionally, we may not be able to hire new employees quickly enough to meet our needs. If we fail to effectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate our new hires, our efficiency and ability to meet our forecasts and our employee morale, productivity and retention could suffer, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nWe also acquire and retain customers through paid search/product listing ads, paid social, retargeting and personalized email and inbound marketing. If we are unable to cost-effectively drive traffic to our websites or mobile app, our ability to acquire new customers and our financial condition would suffer.\n\nAdditionally, the growth and expansion of our business and our product offerings in the future will place significant demands on our management. The growth of our business may require significant additional resources, which may not scale in a cost-effective manner or may negatively affect the quality of our customer experience. We are also required to manage multiple relationships with various vendors, customers and other third parties. Further growth of our operations, our vendor base, our fulfillment process, information technology systems or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations. If we are unable to manage the growth of our organization effectively, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\n\n**_If we are unable to obtain additional funding, we may not be able to grow our business operations._**\n\nWe will require additional funds to implement our business strategy. We may issue additional equity securities to raise needed capital. We may be unable to secure such funding when needed in adequate amounts or on acceptable terms, if at all. Any additional equity financing may involve substantial dilution to our then existing stockholders. The inability to raise additional capital will restrict our ability to develop and conduct business operations.\n\n**_We may be unable to accurately forecast net sales and appropriately plan our expenses in the future._**\n\nWe may base our current and future expense levels on our operating forecasts and estimates of future net sales and gross margins. Net sales and operating results are difficult to forecast, because they generally depend on the volume, timing and type of orders we receive, all of which are uncertain. Additionally, our business is affected by general economic and business conditions in the United States. A significant portion of our expenses is fixed, and as a result, we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in net sales. Any failure to accurately predict net sales or gross margins could cause our operating results in any given quarter, or a series of quarters, to be lower than expected, which could cause the price of our Common Stock to decline substantially.\n\n**_Competition from other brands may hinder the development of our business._**\n\nIncreased competitor consolidations, marketplace competition and competitive product and pricing pressures could impact our earnings, market share and volume growth. If, due to such pressure or other competitive threats, we are unable to sufficiently maintain or develop our sales, we may be unable to achieve our current revenue and financial targets. As a means of maintaining and expanding our sales revenues, we intend to introduce additional brands. We may not be successful in doing this, or it may take us longer than anticipated to achieve market acceptance of these new brands, if at all. Other companies may be more successful in this regard over the long term. Competition, particularly from companies with greater financial and marketing resources than ours, could have a material adverse effect on our existing markets, as well as on our ability to expand the market for our products.\n\n**_We compete in an industry that is brand-conscious, so brand name recognition and acceptance of our products are critical to our success._**\n\nOur business is substantially dependent upon awareness and market acceptance of our products and brands by our target markets: patriotic Americans and military service families. In addition, our business depends on acceptance by ecommerce and social media sales and distribution platforms that have the potential to provide incremental sales growth. If we are not successful in the growth of our brand and product offerings or obtaining the rights to other brands, we may not achieve and maintain satisfactory levels of acceptance by ecommerce and social media platforms and retail consumers. Any failure of our brands to maintain or increase acceptance or market penetration would likely have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial results.\n\n27  \n---  \n  \n**_Our brands’ images are keys to our business and any inability to maintain positive brand images could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations._**\n\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain a positive brand image for our existing products and effectively build up brand image for new products and brand extensions. We cannot predict whether our advertising, marketing and promotional programs will have the desired impact on our products’ branding and on consumer preferences. In addition, negative public relations and product quality issues, whether real or imagined, could tarnish our reputation and image of the affected brands and could cause consumers to choose other products. Our brand image can also be adversely affected by unfavorable reports, studies and articles or litigation involving our products or those of our competitors.\n\n**_If we fail to protect our trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, we may be unable to successfully market our products and compete effectively._**\n\nWe rely on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secrecy laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our brand and our reputation, and adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Further, enforcing or defending our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. We regard our intellectual property, particularly our trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, as crucial to our business and our success. However, the steps taken by us to protect these proprietary rights may not be adequate and may not prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our trademarks, copyrights trade secrets or similar proprietary rights. In addition, other parties may seek to assert infringement claims against us, and we may have to pursue litigation against other parties to assert our rights. Any such claim or litigation could be costly. Furthermore, any event that would jeopardize our proprietary rights or any claims of infringement by third parties could have a material adverse effect on our ability to market or sell our brands, profitably exploit our products or recoup our associated research and development costs.\n\n**_If we lose any of our key management personnel, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives._**\n\nOur future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our management and consultants. The Company’s operations and business strategy are dependent upon the knowledge and business experience of our executive officers and our consultants. We have entered into employment agreements with Maximiliano Ojeda, our Chief Executive Officer; Virginia Hilfiger, our Chief Brand Officer; and Julian Groves, our Chief Operating Officer. Nonetheless, if we were to lose the services of Mr. Ojeda, Ms. Hilfiger or Mr. Groves, our ability to manage our relationship with Stand Co. and create new products; as well as our ability to manage our operations, could be materially impaired. Although we hope to retain the services of all of our officers, if an officer should choose to leave us for any reason before we have hired additional personnel, our operations may suffer. If we should lose their services before we are able to engage and retain qualified employees and consultants to execute our business plan, we may not be able to continue to develop our business as quickly or efficiently.\n\nIn addition, we must be able to attract, train, motivate and retain highly skilled and experienced employees in order to successfully develop our business. Qualified employees often are in great demand and may be unavailable in the time frame required to satisfy our business requirements. We may not be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees in the future. The loss of personnel or our inability to hire or retain sufficient personnel at competitive rates of compensation could impair our ability to successfully grow our business. If we lose the services of any of our consultants, we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel, which could harm our business.\n\n**_Our management team has limited experience managing a public company, and regulatory compliance may divert its attention from the day-to-day management of our business._**\n\nThe individuals who now constitute our management team have limited experience managing a publicly-traded company and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and incremental reporting obligations under the federal securities laws. In particular, these new obligations will require substantial attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n28  \n---  \n  \n**_We depend on the continued growth of ecommerce._**\n\nThe business of selling products over the Internet is highly dynamic. If customers cease to find our website experience easy to use and offering good value, or otherwise lose interest in shopping in this manner, we may not acquire new customers at rates consistent with historical or projected periods, and existing customers’ buying patterns and levels may be less than historical or projected rates and our business, financial condition and operating results may suffer.\n\n**_If we fail to acquire new customers, we may not be able to increase net sales or achieve profitability._**\n\nWe have invested in marketing and branding related to customer acquisition and expect to continue to do so. We must continue to acquire customers in order to increase net sales and achieve profitability. In order to expand our customer base, we must appeal to and acquire customers who have historically used other means of commerce to purchase products and may prefer alternatives to our offerings, other retailers’ websites or the websites of our competitors. We cannot assure that the net sales from new customers we acquire will ultimately exceed the cost of acquiring those customers. If consumers do not perceive the products we offer to be of high value and quality, we may not be able to acquire new customers. If we are unable to acquire new customers who purchase products in numbers sufficient to grow our business, the net sales we generate may decrease, and our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe use social networking sites, such as Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, online services, search engines, affiliate marketing websites, directories and other social media websites and ecommerce businesses to advertise, market and direct potential customers to our site. As ecommerce and social networking continue to rapidly evolve, we must continue to use ecommerce and social media channels that are used by our current and prospective customers and cost-effectively drive traffic to our website. We believe that failure to utilize these channels as sources of traffic to our site to generate new customers would adversely affect our financial condition.\n\n**_Our reliance on logistics service providers, distributors, ecommerce and social media platforms, retailers and brokers could affect our ability to efficiently and profitably promote, sell, distribute and market our products, maintain our existing markets and expand our business into other geographic markets._**\n\nOur ability to maintain and expand our existing markets for our products, and to establish markets in new geographic distribution areas, is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain successful relationships with reliable logistics service providers, distributors, ecommerce and social media platforms, retailers and brokers strategically positioned to serve those areas. Most of our distributors, retailers and brokers promote, sell and distribute competing products, and our products may represent a small portion of their businesses. The success of our distribution network depends on the performance of the logistics service providers, distributors, ecommerce and social media platforms, retailers and brokers in our network. There is a risk they may not adequately perform their functions within the network by, without limitation, failing to distribute to sufficient retailers or positioning our products in localities that may not be receptive to our product. Our ability to incentivize and motivate distributors to manage and sell our products is affected by competition from other companies who have greater resources than we do. To the extent that our distributors, retailers and brokers are distracted from selling our products or do not employ sufficient efforts in managing and selling our products, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, such third parties’ financial position or market share may deteriorate, which could adversely affect our distribution, marketing and sales activities.\n\n**_We will be dependent on our suppliers and do not have supply agreements with our suppliers. Events adversely affecting our suppliers, manufacturers and contractors would adversely affect us._**\n\nIf we experience significantly increased sales and since we do not have supply agreements to ensure our requirements, there can be no assurance that additional products will be available when required or on terms that are favorable to us, or that a supplier would allocate sufficient products to us in order to meet our requirements or fill our orders in a timely manner which could lead to delays to our customers, which could hurt our relationships with our customers, result in negative publicity, damage our brand and adversely affect our business, prospects and operating results.\n\nWe intend to maintain a full supply chain for the provision of our products. Suppliers, manufacturers, service providers and contractors may elect, at any time, to decline or withdraw services necessary for our operations. Loss of these suppliers, manufacturers, service providers and contractors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, any significant interruption, negative change in the availability or economics of the supply chain or increase in the prices for the production of our products provided by any such third-party suppliers, manufacturers, service providers and contractors could materially impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Any inability to secure required supplies or to do so on appropriate terms could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n29  \n---  \n  \n**_Our sales may be adversely affected if we fail to respond to changes in consumer preferences in a timely manner or are not successful in expanding our product offerings._**\n\nOur financial performance depends on our ability to identify, originate and define retail product trends, as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner. Our products must appeal to a broad audience whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. Our business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences dictated in part by perceived product value and seasonal variations.\n\nWe may broaden our product offerings in the future. We continue to explore additional categories which may be accepted by our target customers. If we offer new products or categories that are not accepted by our customers, our sales may fall short of expectations, our brand and reputation could be adversely affected and we may incur expenses that are not offset by sales. If we expand into new categories, consumer demands may be different, and there is no assurance that we will be successful in these new categories. We may make substantial investments in such new categories in anticipation of future net sales. If the launch of a new category requires investments greater than we expect, if we are unable to attract vendors that produce sufficient high quality, value-oriented products or if the sales generated from a new category grow more slowly or produce lower gross margins than we expect, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\n\nExpansion of our brands and product lines may also strain our management and operational resources, specifically the need to hire and manage additional merchandise buyers to source these new products. We may also face greater competition in specific categories from Internet sites or retailers that are more focused on such categories. It may be difficult to differentiate our offering from other competitors as we offer additional product categories, and our customers may have additional considerations in deciding whether or not to purchase these additional product categories. In addition, the relative profitability, if any, of new product lines may be lower than what we have experienced historically, and we may not generate sufficient net sales from new product initiatives to recoup our investments in them. If any of these were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n**_Uncertainties in economic conditions and their impact on consumer spending patterns could adversely impact our operating results._**\n\nOur performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending. Some of the factors adversely affecting consumer spending include levels of unemployment, consumer debt levels, changes in net worth based on market changes and uncertainty, home foreclosures and changes in home values, fluctuating interest rates, credit availability, government actions, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty. Adverse economic changes in any of the regions in which we sell our products could reduce consumer confidence and could negatively affect net sales and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\n\n**_Failure to continue to provide our customers with merchandise from vendors will harm our business._**\n\nOur net sales depend, in part, on our ability to continue to source merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices from vendors. Offering a variety of styles, categories and products at affordable price points is important to our ability to acquire new customers and to keep our existing customers engaged and purchasing products. Growth in the number of our customers, as well as increased competition, may make it difficult to source additional brands and styles in sufficient quantities and on acceptable terms to meet the demand of our customers.\n\nWe have no contractual assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products, and vendors could change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us for future sales at any time. If we are not able to effectively promote our brand, we may lose customers to our competitors. Even if we identify new vendors, we may not be able to purchase desired merchandise in sufficient quantities on terms acceptable to us in the future, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors. An inability to purchase suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or to source new vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n30  \n---  \n  \n**_Failure of our vendors to supply high quality and compliant merchandise in a timely manner may damage our reputation and brand and harm our business._**\n\nWe depend on our vendors to supply high-quality merchandise in a timely manner. The failure of these vendors to supply merchandise which meets our quality standards or the quality standards of our customers could damage our reputation and harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nOur vendors are subject to various risks, including raw material costs, inflation, labor disputes, union organizing activities, boycotts, financial liquidity, product merchantability, safety issues, inclement weather, natural disasters, disruptions in exports, trade restrictions, trade disruptions, currency fluctuations and general economic and political conditions that could limit the ability of our vendors to provide us with high-quality merchandise on a timely basis and at prices and payment terms that are commercially acceptable. For these or other reasons, one or more of our vendors might not adhere to our vendor terms and conditions or their applicable contract or might stop providing us with high-quality merchandise. If there are any deficiencies in the products our vendors have provided to us, we might not identify such deficiencies before products ship to our customers.\n\nIn addition, our vendors may have difficulty adjusting to our changing demands and growing business. Failure of our vendors to provide us with quality merchandise that complies with all applicable laws, including product safety regulations and legislation in a timely and effective manner could damage our reputation and brand. Further, any merchandise could become subject to a recall, regulatory action or legal claim, which could result in increased legal expenses as well as damage to our reputation and brand and harm to our business. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States and other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type or effect of any such restrictions. Such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nWe purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and international manufacturers. Failure of our vendors to comply with applicable laws and regulations and contractual requirements could lead to litigation against us, resulting in increased legal expenses and costs.\n\n**_If we do not successfully optimize and manage our fulfillment processes, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed._**\n\nIf we do not optimize and manage our fulfillment processes successfully and efficiently, it could result in excess or insufficient fulfillment, an increase in costs or impairment charges or harm our business in other ways. If we do not have sufficient fulfillment capacity or experience a problem fulfilling orders in a timely manner, our customers may experience delays in receiving their purchases, which could harm our reputation and our relationship with our customers.\n\nIf we add new products or categories with different fulfillment requirements or change the mix in products that we sell, our fulfillment will become increasingly complex. Failure to successfully address such challenges in a cost-effective and timely manner could impair our ability to timely deliver our customers’ purchases and could harm our reputation and ultimately, our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nIf we grow faster than we anticipate, we may exceed our fulfillment center’s capacity, we may experience problems fulfilling orders in a timely manner or our customers may experience delays in receiving their purchases, which could harm our reputation and our relationship with our customers, and we would need to increase our capital expenditures more than anticipated.\n\n**_We are subject to payment-related risks._**\n\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, PayPal, gift cards and interest-free payments through Klarna. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with the rules or requirements of any provider of a payment method we accept, among other things, we may be subject to fines or higher transaction fees and may lose, or face restrictions placed upon, our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n31  \n---  \n  \nWe also may incur significant losses from fraud. We may incur losses from claims that the consumer did not authorize the purchase, from merchant fraud, from erroneous transmissions and from consumers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments. In addition to the direct costs of such losses, if they are related to credit card transactions and become excessive, they could potentially result in our losing the right to accept credit cards for payment. In addition, under current credit card practices, we are liable for fraudulent credit card transactions because we do not obtain a cardholder’s signature. We use a third-party fraud specialist to monitor our credit transactions. Our failure to adequately control fraudulent transactions could damage our reputation and brand and result in litigation or regulatory action, causing an increase in legal expenses and fees and substantially harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\n\n**_Government regulation of the Internet and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and results of operations._**\n\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and e-commerce. Existing and future regulations and laws could impede the growth of the Internet, ecommerce or mobile commerce. These regulations and laws may involve taxes, tariffs, privacy and data security, anti-spam, content protection, electronic contracts and communications, consumer protection and gift cards. We cannot guarantee that our practices have complied, comply or will comply fully with all such laws and regulations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation, a loss in business and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Any such proceeding or action could hurt our reputation, force us to spend significant amounts in defense of these proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, decrease the use of our site by consumers and vendors and may result in the imposition of monetary liability. We may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with any such laws or regulations.\n\n**_Failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, or the expansion of current or the enactment of new laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, could adversely affect our business and our financial condition._**\n\nA variety of laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data. Laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and other legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, including those relating to the use of data for marketing purposes. It is possible, however, that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict with other rules or our practices. We cannot guarantee that our practices have complied or will comply fully with all such laws, regulations, requirements and obligations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations, industry self-regulatory principles, industry standards or codes could adversely affect our reputations, brand and business, and may result in claims, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other liabilities. Any such claim, proceeding or action could hurt our reputation, brand and business, force us to incur significant expenses in defense of such proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, result in a loss of customers and vendors and may result in the imposition of monetary liability. We may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with any laws, regulations or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection or any inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure of data that we store or handle as part of operating our business.\n\n**_Our failure or the failure of third-party service providers to protect our site, networks and systems against security breaches, or otherwise to protect our confidential information, could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business and operating results._**\n\nWe collect, maintain, transmit and store data about our customers, vendors and others, including credit card information and personally identifiable information, as well as other confidential and proprietary information. We also employ third-party service providers that store, process and transmit proprietary, personal and confidential information on our behalf. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties in an effort to securely transmit confidential and sensitive information, including credit card numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries or other developments may result in the whole or partial failure of this technology to protect transaction data or other confidential and sensitive information from being breached or compromised. More generally, we take steps to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the information we collect, store or transmit, but there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts. Our security measures, and those of our third-party service providers, may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering, security breaches or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information. We and our service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent all types of attacks, and techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers. In addition, security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships.\n\n32  \n---  \n  \nAny compromise or breach of our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could violate applicable privacy, data security and other laws, and cause significant legal and financial exposure, adverse publicity and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse and material effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Although we maintain privacy, data breach and network security liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. We may need to devote significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches, diverting resources from the growth and expansion of our business.\n\n**_Breaches of our online commerce security could occur and could have an adverse effect on our reputation._**\n\nA significant barrier to online commerce and communications is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. There can be no assurance that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography and cybersecurity, or other events or developments will not result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by the Company to protect customer transaction data. If any such compromise of the Company’s security were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and, therefore, on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in the Company’s operations. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches. Concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the Internet and other online services and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the Internet and other online services generally, and the Web in particular, especially as a means of conducting commercial transactions. To the extent that activities of the Company involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information, security breaches could damage our reputation and expose the Company to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. There can be no assurance our security measures will prevent security breaches or that failure to prevent such security breaches will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition\n\n**_We may incur material losses and costs as a result of manufacturer’s product defects, warranty claims or product liability actions that may be brought against us._**\n\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability in the event that products that we sell fail to perform as expected or failure results in bodily injury or property damage which could cause us to lose revenues, incur increased costs associated with customer support, experience delays increased returns or discounts, and damage our reputation, all of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. If any of the products we sell are or are alleged to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products.\n\n**_Our ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from growing._**\n\nIn the future, we could be required to raise capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business. If we sell any such securities in subsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and could reduce our operational flexibility or profitability, such as covenants that could limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, liens or other encumbrances, make dividends or other distributions to holders of our capital stock, and sell or transfer assets, as well as certain financial covenants. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures.\n\n33  \n---  \n  \n**_The price of our Common Stock may rapidly fluctuate or may decline regardless of our operating performance, resulting in substantial losses for investors._**\n\nThe trading price of our Common Stock may be subject to instances of extreme stock price run-ups followed by rapid price declines and stock price volatility unrelated to both our actual and expected operating performance and financial condition or prospects, making it difficult for prospective investors to assess the rapidly changing value of our stock. Further, the trading price of our Common Stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including limited trading volume, actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations; the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections; failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our Company, changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our Company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors; announcements by us or our competitors of significant innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, operating results or capital commitments; changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other companies in our industry; price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole; changes in our Board or management; sales of large blocks of our Common Stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders; lawsuits threatened or filed against us; changes in laws or regulations applicable to our business; the expiration of lock-up agreements; changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of debt or equity securities; short sales, hedging and other derivative transactions involving our capital stock; general economic and geopolitical conditions, including the current or anticipated impact of military conflict and related sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and other countries due to Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine; and the other factors described in this section of the prospectus captioned \"_Risk Factors_.”\n\n**_Geopolitical conditions, including trade disputes and direct or indirect acts of war or terrorism, could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results._**\n\nOur operations could be disrupted by geopolitical conditions, trade disputes, international boycotts and sanctions, political and social instability, acts of war, terrorist activity or other similar events. From time to time, we could have a large number of customers located in a particular geographic region. Decreased demand from a discrete event impacting a region in which we have a concentrated exposure could negatively impact our results of operations.\n\nIn February 2022, Russia initiated significant military action against Ukraine. In response, the U.S. and certain other countries imposed significant sanctions and export controls against Russia, Belarus and certain individuals and entities connected to Russian or Belarusian political, business, and financial organizations, and the U.S. and certain other countries could impose further sanctions, trade restrictions, and other retaliatory actions should the conflict continue or worsen. It is not possible to predict the broader consequences of the conflict, including related geopolitical tensions, and the measures and retaliatory actions taken by the U.S. and other countries in respect thereof as well as any counter measures or retaliatory actions by Russia or Belarus in response, including, for example, potential cyberattacks or the disruption of energy exports, is likely to cause regional instability, geopolitical shifts, and could materially adversely affect global trade, currency exchange rates, regional economies and the global economy. In addition, the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East may further impact global economic conditions and market sentiments. This, in turn, could adversely affect the trading price of our shares of Common Stock and investor interest in us. The outcome of the Russia-Ukraine war and conflicts in the Middle East remain uncertain, and while it is difficult to predict the impact of any of the foregoing, the conflict and actions taken in response to the conflict could increase our costs, disrupt our supply chain, reduce our sales and earnings, impair our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n**_We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk._**\n\nIf the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues and operating expenses. Similarly, our net revenues and operating expenses will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies. As we expand our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations will become more pronounced. We may enter into short-term currency forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities recorded in non-functional currencies. The use of such hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates.\n\n34  \n---  \n  \n**_Climate change may negatively affect our business._**\n\nThere is growing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures may cause an adverse change in weather patterns around the globe resulting in an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions may disrupt the operation of our supply chain or impact demand for our products. In addition, the increasing concern over climate change may result in more regional, federal and global legal and regulatory requirements and could result in increased production and transportation costs. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\n**Risks Associated with MGO’s Capital Stock**\n\n**_We may not be able to maintain a listing of our Common Stock on Nasdaq._**\n\nWe must meet certain financial and liquidity criteria to maintain such listing. If we fail to meet any of Nasdaq’s continued listing standards or we violate Nasdaq listing requirements, our Common Stock may be delisted. In addition, our board of directors may determine that the cost of maintaining our listing on a national securities exchange outweighs the benefits of such listing. A delisting of our Common Stock from Nasdaq may materially impair our stockholders’ ability to buy and sell our Common Stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our Common Stock. The delisting of our Common Stock could significantly impair our ability to raise capital and the value of your investment.\n\n**_The market price of our securities may be volatile and may fluctuate in a way that is disproportionate to our operating performance._**\n\nOur securities may experience substantial volatility as a result of a number of factors, including, among others:\n\n● | sales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock;  \n---|---  \n● | announcements about us or about our competitors or new product introductions;  \n● | developments concerning our product manufacturers and suppliers;  \n● | governmental regulation and legislation;  \n● | variations in our anticipated or actual operating results;  \n● | changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our performance, or our failure to meet analysts’ expectations, if/when applicable;  \n● | foreign currency values and fluctuations; and  \n● | overall political and economic conditions.  \n  \nMany of these factors are beyond our control. The stock markets have historically experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These broad market and industry factors could reduce the market price of our securities, regardless of our actual operating performance.\n\n**_We do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our shares of Common Stock. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain._**\n\nWe intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them at a price higher than that which they initially paid for such shares. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, from the sale of our Common Stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\n\n**_We incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public reporting company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to regulatory compliance initiatives._**\n\nAs a public company, we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and other applicable securities rules and regulations. As a public reporting company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses not otherwise incurred by a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and have made some activities more time consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations will continue to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to maintain director and officer liability insurance.\n\n35  \n---  \n  \n**_If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our shares or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, the price of our securities and trading volume could decline._**\n\nThe trading market for our securities will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, the price of our securities could decline.\n\n**_We are an \"emerging growth company” and a \"smaller reporting company” under the JOBS Act, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies will make our Common Stock less attractive to investors._**\n\nWe are an \"emerging growth company” and a \"smaller reporting company” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \"emerging growth companies” and \"smaller reporting companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\n\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \"emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \"emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\n\nWe will remain an \"emerging growth company” until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our Common Stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed $1.235 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period, or if the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.\n\nWe may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as (i) the market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates is equal to or less than $250 million as of the last business day of the most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (ii) our annual revenues is equal to or less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates is equal to or less than $700 million as of the last business day of the most recently completed second fiscal quarter.\n\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our Common Stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Common Stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Common Stock and our stock price may be more volatile. In addition, taking advantage of reduced disclosure obligations may make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible. If investors are unable to compare our business with other companies in our industry, we may not be able to raise additional capital as and when we need it, which may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n36  \n---  \n  \n**Risks Related to This Offering**\n\n**_This is a reasonable best efforts offering, with no minimum amount of securities required to be sold, and we may sell fewer than all of the securities offered hereby._**\n\nThe placement agent has agreed to use its best efforts to solicit offers to purchase the shares of Common Stock and Pre-funded Warrants in this offering. The placement agent has no obligation to buy any of the securities from us or to arrange for the purchase or sale of any specific number or dollar amount of the securities. There is no required minimum number of securities that must be sold as a condition to completion of this offering. As there is no minimum offering amount required as a condition to the closing of this offering, the actual offering amount, placement agent fees and proceeds to us are not presently determinable and may be substantially less than the maximum amounts set forth above. We may sell fewer than all of the securities offered hereby, which may significantly reduce the amount of proceeds received by us, and investors in this offering will not receive a refund in the event that we do not sell all of the shares of Common Stock and Pre-funded Warrants offered in this offering. The success of this offering will impact our ability to use the proceeds to execute our business plans. We may have insufficient capital to implement our business plans and satisfy current obligations, potentially resulting in greater operating losses or dilution unless we are able to raise the required capital from alternative sources. There is no assurance that alternative capital, if needed, would be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\n\n**_You will experience immediate dilution in the net tangible book value per share of the Common Stock you purchase, and may experience additional dilution in the future._**\n\nBecause the effective price per share of Common Stock being offered hereby or issuable upon exercise of the Pre-funded Warrants being offered may be higher than the net tangible book value per share of our Common Stock, you may experience dilution to the extent of the difference between the effective offering price per share of Common Stock you pay in this offering and the net tangible book value per share of our Common Stock immediately after this offering. Assuming the sale of [*] shares of Common Stock at a public offering price of $[*] per share and our net tangible book value as of [*], 2024, assuming no sale of any Pre-funded Warrants in this offering, and after deducting the placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us, you will incur immediate dilution in as adjusted net tangible book value of approximately $[*] per share. As a result of the dilution to investors purchasing securities in this offering, investors may receive less than the purchase price paid in this offering, if anything, in the event of the liquidation of our company. See the section entitled \"**Dilution** ” below for a more detailed discussion of the dilution you will incur if you participate in this offering.\n\n**_We have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds we receive from this offering and may not use them effectively._**\n\nOur management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds we receive in this offering, including for any of the purposes described in the section entitled \"**Use of Proceeds** ,” and you will not have the opportunity as part of your investment decision to assess whether our management is using the net proceeds appropriately. Because of the number and variability of factors that will determine our use of our net proceeds from this offering, their ultimate use may vary substantially from their currently intended use. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business and cause the price of our Common Stock to decline. Pending their use, we may invest our net proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. These investments may not yield a favorable return to our stockholders.\n\n**_An active trading market for our shares may not be sustained._**\n\nAlthough our shares are listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC, the market for our shares has demonstrated varying levels of trading activity. The current level of trading may not be sustained in the future. The lack of an active market for our shares may impair investors’ ability to sell their shares at the time they wish to sell them or at a price that they consider reasonable, may reduce the fair market value of their shares and may impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire additional intellectual property assets by using our shares as consideration.\n\n**_This offering may cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decrease._**\n\nThe number of shares of Common Stock we propose to issue and ultimately will issue if this offering is completed, may result in an immediate decrease in the market price of our Common Stock. This decrease may continue after the completion of this offering. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that the availability of shares for future sale represented by the Pre-funded Warrants issued in connection with the offering will have on the market price of our Common Stock from time to time.\n\n37  \n---  \n  \n**_Future sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock._**\n\nWe may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. If additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, or perceptions that those sales could occur, the issuance of these securities could result in further dilution to investors purchasing our Common Stock in this offering or result in downward pressure on the price of our Common Stock, and our ability to raise capital in the future.\n\n**_There is no public market for the Pre-funded Warrants being offered by us in this offering._**\n\nThere is no established public trading market for the Pre-funded Warrants, and we do not expect a market to develop. In addition, we do not intend to apply to list the Pre-funded Warrants on any national securities exchange or other nationally recognized trading system. Without an active market, the liquidity of the Pre-funded Warrants will be limited.\n\n**_Except as otherwise set forth in the Pre-funded Warrants, holders of the Pre-funded Warrants offered hereby will have no rights as stockholders with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying the Pre-funded Warrants until such holders exercise their Pre-funded Warrants and acquire our Common Stock._**\n\nExcept as otherwise set forth in the Pre-funded Warrants, until holders of the Pre-funded Warrants acquire shares of our Common Stock upon exercise thereof, such holders of the Pre-funded Warrants will have no rights with respect to the shares of our Common Stock underlying such warrants, such as voting rights. Upon exercise of the Pre-funded Warrants, as the case may be, the holder will be entitled to exercise the rights of a Common Stockholder only as to matters for which the record date occurs after the exercise date.\n\n**_Purchasers who purchase our securities in this offering pursuant to a securities purchase agreement may have rights not available to purchasers that purchase without the benefit of a securities purchase agreement._**\n\nIn addition to rights and remedies available to all purchasers in this offering under federal securities and state law, the purchasers that enter into a securities purchase agreement will also be able to bring claims for breach of contract against us. The ability to pursue a claim for breach of contract provides those investors with the means to enforce the covenants uniquely available to them under the securities purchase agreement including timely delivery of shares and indemnification for breach of contract.\n\n**_Since we do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future, investors may be forced to sell their stock in order to obtain a return on their investment._**\n\nWe do not anticipate declaring or paying in the foreseeable future any cash dividends on our capital stock. Instead, we plan to retain any earnings to finance our operations and plans discussed elsewhere in this prospectus. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Common Stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any return on their investment. As a result, investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our Common Stock.\n\n**_The trading price of our Common Stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control._**\n\nOur share price is highly volatile. During the period from [*], 2024, to [*], 2024 the closing price of our Common Stock (on a post-reverse split basis) ranged from a high of $[*] per share (as adjusted for the reverse split) to a low of $[*] per share (as adjusted for the reverse split). The stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, you may not be able to sell your Common Stock at or above the public offering price and you may lose some or all of your investment.\n\n**IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE RISKS, BUSINESSES ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO RISKS NOT FORESEEN OR FULLY APPRECIATED BY MANAGEMENT. IN REVIEWING THIS FILING, POTENTIAL INVESTORS SHOULD KEEP IN MIND THAT OTHER POSSIBLE RISKS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY’S SECURITIES.**\n\n38  \n---  \n  \n**SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS**\n\nThis prospectus contains \"forward-looking statements.” Forward-looking statements reflect our management’s current view about future events. When used in this prospectus, the words \"anticipate,” \"believe,” \"estimate,” \"expect,” \"future,” \"intend,” \"plan,” or the negative of these terms and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our management, identify forward-looking statements. Such statements, include, but are not limited to, statements contained in this prospectus relating to our business strategy, our future operating results and liquidity and capital resources outlook. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward–looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees of assurance of future performance. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation:\n\n● | current economic conditions, including consumer spending levels and the price elasticity of our products;  \n---|---  \n● | the highly competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we compete;  \n● | our ability to successfully manage social, political, economic legal and other conditions affecting our operations and our supply chain sources, such as political instability and acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters, disruption of markets, operational disruptions, changes in import or export laws, currency restrictions and currency exchange rate fluctuations;  \n● | the impact of the loss of one or more of our suppliers of finished goods or raw materials;  \n● | our ability to manage our inventory effectively and reduce inventory reserves;  \n● | our ability to optimize our global supply chain;  \n● | our ability to distribute our products effectively through our ecommerce store and through our growing wholesale distribution channel;  \n● | our ability to keep pace with changing consumer preferences;  \n● | the impact of any inadequacy, interruption or failure with respect to our information technology or any data security breach;  \n● | our ability to protect our reputation and the reputation and images of our licensed and any future proprietary brand(s);  \n● | unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or a change in our ability to realize deferred tax benefits;  \n● | our ability to comply with environmental and other laws and regulations;  \n● | changes in our relationship with our employees and costs and adverse publicity from violations of labor or environmental laws by us or our suppliers;  \n● | our ability to attract and retain key personnel;   \n● | our ability to integrate and grow potential acquisitions successfully; and  \n● | other factors (including the risks contained in the section of this prospectus entitled \"_Risk Factors_ ”) relating to our industry, our operations and results of operations  \n  \nShould one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended or planned.\n\nFactors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.\n\n39  \n---  \n  \n**USE OF PROCEEDS**\n\nWe estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $[*] (assuming the sale of all share of Common Stock offered hereby at the assumed public offering price of $[*] per share, which represents the closing sale price of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC on [*],2024), after deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us, and assuming no sale of any Pre-funded Warrants offered hereunder. However, because this is a best efforts offering with no minimum number of securities or amount of proceeds as a condition to closing, the actual offering amount, placement agent fees and net proceeds to us are not presently determinable and may be substantially less than the maximum amounts set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and we may not sell all or any of the securities we are offering. As a result, we may receive significantly less in net proceeds. Based on the assumed offering price set forth above, we estimate that our net proceeds from the sale of 75% or 50% of the shares of Common Stock offered in this offering would be approximately $[*] and $[*], respectively, after deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us.\n\nThe following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will raise the full $[*] as anticipated and there is no guarantee that we will receive any proceeds from the offering. All amounts included in the table below are estimates.\n\nDescription | If 50% of securities offered are sold | If 75% of securities offered are sold | If 100% of securities offered are sold  \n---|---|---|---  \nGross proceeds | $ | $ | $  \nPlacement Agent fees  \nOffering expenses | $ | $ | $  \nNet proceeds | $ | $ | $  \nWorking Capital  \nBusiness Combination Expense  \nSeverance Payments  \nTotal  \n  \n**DIVIDEND POLICY**\n\nWe have never declared any cash dividends since inception, and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Instead, we anticipate that all of our earnings will be used to provide working capital, to support our operations, and to finance the growth and development of our business. The payment of dividends is within the discretion of the Board and will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, prospects, applicable Delaware law, which provides that dividends are only payable out of surplus or current net profits, and other factors our Board might deem relevant. There are no restrictions that currently limit our ability to pay dividends on our Common Stock other than those generally imposed by applicable state law.\n\n**MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS**\n\nOur Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq under the symbol \"MGOL.”\n\nWe have 2,904,001 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding held by 28 stockholders of record.\n\n40  \n---  \n  \n**Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Incentive Plan**\n\nOn August 15, 2022, our Board and our stockholders approved the MGO Global Inc. 2022 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2022 Plan. The 2022 Plan governs equity awards to our employees, directors, officers, consultants and other eligible participants. Initially, the maximum number of shares of our Common Stock that may be subject to awards under the 2022 Plan was 2,186,470. The maximum number of shares that are subject to awards under the 2022 Plan is subject to an annual increase equal to the lesser of (i) 500,000 shares of our Common Stock, (ii) a number of shares of our Common Stock equal to 4% of the prior year’s maximum number or (iii) such number of shares of our Common Stock as determined by the 2022 Plan administrator. The 2022 Plan was made effective on January 11, 2023.\n\nThe types of awards permitted under the 2022 Plan include nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and other awards. Each option shall be exercisable at such times and subject to such terms and conditions as the 2022 Plan administrator may specify.\n\nThe 2022 Plan administrator has the authority to amend, suspend or terminate the 2022 Plan provided such action does not impair the existing rights of any participant. The 2022 Plan automatically will terminate on August 15, 2032, unless it is terminated sooner.\n\nOn April 12, 2024, the Board unanimously authorized and approved an amendment (\"Plan Amendment”) to MGO’s 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2022 Plan”) to increase the number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock, par value $0.00001 per share, (\"Common Stock”) reserved for issuance under the 2022 Plan by an additional 182,451 shares of Common Stock. Such an increase will result in a total of 451,188 shares of Common Stock being reserved under the 2022 Plan, of which 205,071 will be available for future awards. On April 17, 2024 (the \"Record Date”), a majority of our stockholders consented to the Plan Amendment. In accordance with Rule 14c-2 of the Exchange Act, corporate actions described above went effective twenty (20) days after a Schedule 14C Information Statement was mailed to our stockholders on April 29, 2024.\n\nOn June 4, 2024, MGO issued a total of 182,869 unregistered restricted shares of the Company’s Common Stock to directors and officers of the Company, including 41,633 shares issued to Maximiliano Ojeda, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, 41,633 shares issued to Virginia Hilfiger, the Chief Brand Officer of the Company, 41,633 shares issued to Julian Groves, the Chief Operating Officer of the Company, 22,297 shares issued to Dana Perez, the Chief Financial Officer of the Company, and 8,919 shares issued to each non-employee director of the Company. The restricted shares of the Company’s Common Stock were issued pursuant to the MGO’s 2022 Equity Incentive Plan and are exempt from registration in reliance on exemption provided for under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.\n\n**CAPITALIZATION**\n\nThe following table shows our cash and cash equivalents and capitalization as of June 30, 2024 as follows:\n\n● | on an actual basis;  \n---|---  \n● | on a pro forma basis to give effect to the issuance of (i) 685,458 shares of our Common Stock issued pursuant to offerings conducted through the ATM; (ii) 26,000 shares of our restricted Common Stock issued to officers and directors of the Company pursuant to our Equity Incentive Plan; (iii) 7,500 shares of our restricted Common Stock issued pursuant to vested restricted stock units held by a consultant; (iv) 77,000 shares of our restricted Common Stock issued to two new employees; (v) 53,638 shares of our restricted Commons Stock issued to legal counsel for services rendered.  \n● | on a pro forma as adjusted basis to give further effect to our issuance and sale of [*] shares of our Common Stock in this offering (assuming the maximum amount of is sold and no sale of any Pre-Funded Warrants) at a public offering price of $[*] per share, resulting in net proceeds to us of $[*], after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable.  \n  \nThe pro forma information below is illustrative only and our capitalization following the completion of this offering is subject to adjustment based on the public offering price of our Common Stock and other terms of this offering determined at pricing. You should read the following table in conjunction with \"_Use of Proceeds_ ,” \"_Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations_ ” and our financial statements and related notes included in this prospectus.\n\n41  \n---  \n  \n**Actual as of June 30, 2024** |  **Pro Forma** | **Pro forma as Adjusted(1)**  \n---|---|---  \n**Cash and cash equivalents** | $ | 1,301,585 | $ | 2,901,804 | $  \n**Long-term debt** | $ | - | $ | - | $ | -  \n**Total long-term debt** | $ | - | $ | - | $ | -  \n**Stockholders’ equity:**  \nPreferred stock, $0.00001 par value, 20,000,000 shares authorized, and 0 shares issued and outstanding, actual; 0 issued and outstanding pro forma and pro forma as adjusted | $ | - | $ | - | $ | -  \nCommon stock, $0.00001 par value, 150,000,000 shares authorized, actual, pro forma and pro forma, as adjusted; 2,100,524 shares issued and outstanding, actual; 2,787,419 pro forma and [*], pro forma as adjusted | 21 | 27  \nAdditional paid-in capital | 17,906,846 | 19,883,979  \nAccumulated deficit | (15,576,336 | ) | (15,576,336 | )  \nTotal MGO stockholders’ equity | 2,330,534 | 4,307,670  \nNon-controlling interest | (364,600 | ) | (364,600 | )  \nTotal stockholders’ equity | 1,965,934 | ) | 3,943,070 | )  \n**Total capitalization** | $ | 3,267,519 | $ | 6,844,874 | $  \n  \n**DILUTION**\n\nIf you invest in our Common Stock in this offering, your ownership interest will be diluted immediately to the extent of the difference between the public offering price per share of our Common Stock and the as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our Common Stock immediately after this offering.\n\nOur historical net tangible book value (deficit) as of June 30, 2024, was [*]. Our historical net tangible book value (deficit) is the amount of our total tangible assets less our total liabilities. Our historical net tangible book value per share as of June 30, 2024, was [*]. Historical net tangible book value per share represents historical net tangible book value (deficit) divided by the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding as of June 30. 2024.\n\nAfter giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock after June 30, 2024 and prior to this offering, our pro forma net tangible book value as of June 30. 2024 would have been $[*] or approximately $[*] per share of our Common Stock.\n\nAfter further giving effect to the pro forma adjustments set forth above and our issuance and sale of [*] shares of Common Stock in this offering at an assumed public offering price of $[*] per share (the closing sale price of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC on October [*], 2024), assuming no sale of any Pre-Funded Warrants in this offering and after deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of June 30. 2024 would have been approximately $[*], or approximately $[*] per share. This represents an immediate increase in pro forma net tangible book value per share of $[*] to our existing stockholders and an immediate dilution in pro forma net tangible book value per share of approximately $[*] to new investors purchasing Common Stock in this offering. Dilution per share to new investors purchasing Common Stock in this offering is determined by subtracting as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering from the public offering price per share paid by new investors.\n\nThe following table illustrates this dilution on a per share basis:\n\nPublic offering price per share | $| [*]  \n---|---|---  \nPro forma net tangible book value per share as of June 30, 2024 | $| [*]  \nIncrease in pro forma net tangible book value (deficit) per share as of June 30. 2024 | [*]  \nPro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering | $| [*]  \nDilution per share to new investors purchasing shares in this offering | $ | [*]  \n  \nIf we only sell 75% or 50% of the maximum offering amount, our as adjusted net tangible book value after this offering would be $[*], or $[*], respectively, and the dilution per share to investors purchasing securities in this offering would be $[*] or $[*], respectively, assuming no Pre-Funded Warrants are sold and after deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us.\n\nThe information discussed above is illustrative only and will be adjusted based on the actual public offering price, the actual number of units that we offer in this offering, and other terms of this offering determined at the time of pricing. The foregoing discussion and table assumes no sale of Pre-Funded Warrants, which if sold, would reduce the number of shares that we are offering on a one-for-one basis. In addition, we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of these securities could result in further dilution to our stockholders.\n\n42  \n---  \n  \n**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF**\n\n**FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**\n\n_The following discussion and analysis summarize the significant factors affecting our operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of our Company as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this prospectus. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this prospectus, particularly in the sections titled \"Risk Factors” and \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”**For a discussion and analysis of the significant factors affecting Heidmar’s operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows, see Exhibit 99.1 to the registration statement which this prospectus forms a part.**_\n\n**Overview**\n\nFounded in October 2018 and headquartered in Florida with remote employees and specialty contractors in London, New York and Latin America, MGO Global Inc. (\"MGO,” \"MGO Global,” the \"Company,” \"we,” \"our” and \"us”) has built a brand acceleration platform with a focus on the acquisition, optimization and monetization of consumer brands across multiple categories. Our mission is to provide customers with unmatched variety, quality and shopping experience, while adding considerable value for MGO’s shareholders.\n\nOur accomplished leadership team encompasses decades of experience in building successful global lifestyle brands, including fashion design, marketing, technology, corporate finance and branding.

Through our end-to-end, scalable brand-building platform, backed by robust consumer behavioral data, we are engaged in nurturing digitally native brands that will thrive in the modern Direct to Consumer (\"DTC”) economy.\n\n**_Stand Flagpoles/Americana Liberty, LLC_**\n\nOn March 13, 2023, we obtained a royalty-free, worldwide and exclusive license (the \"License”) to the use of certain assets of Stand Co., LLC (\"Stand”) for all purposes in exchange for payment of $1.00 by the Company. The license is in perpetuity. Licensed assets include all rights to all stock keeping units (\"SKU”) of Stand sold under the names: \"Roosevelt Premium 25 foot Telescoping Flag Pole Kit,” \"20 Foot Telescoping Flag Pole Kit” and \"LED Solar Flag Pole Light;” any intellectual property and other intangible property related to SKUs, including but not limited to all rights to a brand name \"Stand Flagpoles,” domain and website www.standflagpoles.com, the Meta pages associated with \"Stand Flagpoles” brand name (in Facebook and Instagram); all manufacturer, distributor and customer contracts and relationships for SKUs; marketing materials; any commercialization rights; domain and administrative access to Stand’s Shopify account, Facebook Assets & Accounts; all historical digital and non-digital assets; and customer database since inception.\n\nIn support of our new flagpole business, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Americana Liberty, LLC (\"Americana Liberty”), on March 13, 2023, which was created to advertise and sell the licensed line of _Stand Flagpoles_ and other related products, along with an expanding line of patriotic-themed products to be developed and marketed to consumers under our new _Americana Liberty_ brand.\n\nIn addition, on May 11, 2023, we executed a 12-month consulting agreement with Jason Harward, the owner of Stand Co. and nephew of our former Chief Marketing Officer of the Company. The consultant shall furnish the Company with business continuity and consulting services, substantially similar to the following: providing general advice and counsel regarding establishment of systems and processes for direct-to-consumer (\"DTC”) and ecommerce sales and operations; provide subject matter and product-level expertise in the area of flag-poles, flags, and related products; provide consultation regarding product sourcing and distribution; and assist with the establishment, operation, optimization, and maintenance of DTC and ecommerce platforms on behalf of the Company.

The _Messi Brand_ is a premium lifestyle brand with a sporty edge and sold their products direct to consumers through the website www.themessistore.com.\n\nOn October 29, 2018, MGOTeam1 entered into a Trademark License Agreement with Leo Messi Management SL (\"LMM”). LMM granted MGOTeam1 a worldwide non-exclusive license in order to use Leo Messi’s trademarks with the purpose of developing, manufacturing, trading and promoting _Messi Brand_ Products.\n\nOn November 20, 2021, MGOTeam1 entered into a new Trademark License Agreement (the \"Messi License”) with LMM to have the worldwide license to use Leo Messi’s trademarks for the purpose of developing, manufacturing, marketing and promoting his products. MGOTeam1 was to pay LMM a minimum guaranteed amount on account of royalties amounting to Four Million Euros (€4,000,000) over the four-year agreement, net of taxes with the last payment due on November 15, 2024.\n\nOn March 21, 2024, MGOTeam1 assigned the Messi License to Centric Brands LLC (\"Centric”), which paid MGOTeam1 $2,000,000 in cash and assumed the obligation to pay the minimum guaranteed amount due to LMM in 2024.\n\n**_Business Combination Agreement with Heidmar, Inc._**\n\nOn June 18, 2024, MGO entered into a definitive Business Combination Agreement (the \"Business Combination Agreement” or \"BCA”) with Heidmar, Inc., (\"Heidmar”), a company organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Heidmar Maritime Holdings Corp., a company organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (\"Holdings”), HMR Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings (\"Merger Sub”), and Rhea Marine Ltd. and Maistros Shipinvest Corp (collectively, the \"Heidmar Shareholders”). The Company, Merger Sub, Holdings, Heidmar and Heidmar Shareholders are sometimes referred to herein individually as a \"Party” and, collectively, as the \"Parties.”\n\nPursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, MGO, Heidmar, Holdings, Merger Sub and the Heidmar Shareholders will effect a business combination involving the following Transactions (collectively, the \"Business Combination”):\n\n(a) | Merger Sub will merge (the \"Merger”) with and into MGO, with MGO continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings;  \n---|---  \n(b) | all of the issued and outstanding MGO Shares prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into the right to receive Holdings Shares on a one-for-one basis at the closing of the Business Combination;  \n(c) | immediately after the effective time of the Merger, the Heidmar Shareholders will transfer all their Heidmar Shares to Holdings (the \"Heidmar Share Acquisition”), with Heidmar becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings; and  \n(a) | Holdings will issue to the Heidmar Shareholders and MGO’s financial advisor: (i) at the Closing (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), the Heidmar Share Consideration (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), and (ii) after the Closing and upon the satisfaction of certain earnout conditions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement, the Earnout Shares (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement), with 2.64% of each issuance being distributed to MGO’s financial advisor.  \n  \nFollowing the Closing, both MGO and Heidmar will be wholly owned subsidiaries of Holdings, and the Holdings Shares will be publicly listed on Nasdaq. The parties expect that after the Closing, the Heidmar Shareholders will own 94.34% of Holdings (including amounts to be distributed to MGO’s financial advisor) and the MGO stockholders will own 5.66% of Holdings, without taking into account the issuance of any Earnout Shares. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, any shares of common stock that MGO issues prior to the Closing will not change these percentages.\n\n44  \n---  \n  \nThe boards of directors of both companies have unanimously approved the signing of the BCA. The Business Combination is expected to close late in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to satisfying certain customary closing conditions, including the receipt of approvals from MGO’s stockholders and the listing of Holdings registered common shares on Nasdaq.

The decrease over the prior year’s comparable period is attributable to the fact that the Company had a large marketing push at the end of the second quarter of 2023, which successfully increased revenue, however the return on marketing costs was below the Company’s desired threshold. Therefore, the Company made cognitive efforts to focus on a higher return on marketing costs subsequent to June 30, 2023. Revenues reported for the six months ended June 30, 2024 totaled $2,095,853, representing an 18% increase over revenues of $1,769,440 posted for the comparable six-month period in 2023. The increase over the prior year’s comparable three and six periods is primarily attributable to the fact that the Company did not launch sales of its _Stand Flagpole_ line of products until mid-March 2023.\n\n_Cost of Sales and Gross Profit_\n\nCost of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 decreased 32% to $346,356 from $508,861, respectively. This resulted in a gross profit of $1,079,233 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, which compared to $1,215,432 for the same three-month period in 2023. The 5% increase in gross profit was due to the Company optimizing sales prices while reducing purchasing costs.\n\n45  \n---  \n  \nFor the reason mentioned above, cost of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2024 totaled $514,088, down 2% from $526,470 reported for the same six-month period in the prior year. This resulted in a 5% increase in gross profit of $1,581,765 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $1,242,970 for the six-month ended June 30, 2023.\n\n_Operating Expenses_\n\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, total operating expenses rose 213% to $2,496,148 as compared to total operating expenses of $797,485 for the three months ended June 30, 2023, due primarily to a 213% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, which rose to $2,496,148 from $797,485, respectively; and a 22% decrease in marketing and e-commerce expenses, declining to $1,024,062 from $1,320,100, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related to workforce expansion, stock-based compensation expenses which were not occurring in the prior year, and increased costs of legal and accounting expenses pertaining to executing capital raises during the quarter and advancing the business combination process with Heidmar. The decrease in marketing expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2024 when compared to the prior year’s same three-month period is attributable to the fact that the Company had a large marketing push at the end of the second quarter of 2023, which successfully increased revenue, however the return on marketing costs was below the Company’s desired threshold. Therefore, the Company made cognitive efforts to focus on a higher return on marketing spend.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the six-month period ended June 30, 2024 was $5,887,524, representing a 107% increase compared to $2,837,685 in total operating expenses for the same six months in 2023. The increase was largely attributable to a 189% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, which rose to $4,325,832 from $1,497,811, respectively; and a 17% increase in marketing and e-commerce expenses, which climbed to $1,561,692 from $1,339,874, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related to workforce expansion, stock-based compensation expenses which were not occurring in the prior year, and increased costs of legal and accounting expenses pertaining to executing capital raises and advancing the business combination process with Heidmar during the first six months of 2024.\n\n_Other (Income) Expenses_\n\nTotal other income (expenses) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 was ($1,111) and ($464), respectively, compared to total other interest income of $29,820 and $29,876 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively.\n\n_Net Loss_\n\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, net loss from continuing operations was $2,442,088, a 180% increase from a net loss of $872,333 reported for the same three-month period in 2023. Net loss from discontinued operations decreased to $33,527 from a net loss of $525,872 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Overall, net loss totaled $2,475,615 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $1,398,205 for the same three-month period ended June 30, 2023. After factoring a net loss of $3,963 and a net loss of $60,687 for non-controlling interest for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, net loss attributable to MGO stockholders was $2,471,652, or $1.35. loss per share, and $1,337,518 or $0.94 loss per share, respectively.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, net loss from continuing operations was $4,306,223, a 175% increase from a net loss of $1,564,839 reported for the same six-month period in 2023. Net income from discontinued operations rose to $1,893,771 from a net loss of $1,053,491 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as a result of the assignment of the Messi License to Centric. Overall, net loss totaled $2,412,452 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $2,618,330 posted for the same six-month period ended June 30, 2023. After factoring net income of $223,844 and a net loss of $122,756 for non-controlling interest for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, net loss attributable to MGO stockholders was $2,636,296, or $1.57 loss per share, and $2,495,574, or $1.79 loss per share, respectively.\n\n46  \n---  \n  \n**Cash Flows**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, cash on hand from continuing operations was $1,301,585, as compared to $836,446 as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 56%. The increase was primarily attributable to the assignment of the _Messi Brand_ to Centric in exchange for $2,000,000 in cash and their assumption of our obligation to pay €1.5 million in royalty payments to LMM in 2024, as well as net proceeds aggregating $1,665,534 received from the sale of our common stock pursuant to our At-The-Market Offering (\"ATM”). Until such time that the Company fully implements its growth strategy or completes its business combination with Heidmar, it expects to continue generating operating losses in the foreseeable future, primarily due to higher corporate overhead, higher marketing and inventory expenses and costs associated with being a public company.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, cash used in operations was $3,223,920, a decrease of 20% as compared to cash used of $4,026,328 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to the assignment of the _Messi Brand_ to Centric in exchange for $2,000,000 in cash and their assumption of our obligation to pay €1.5 million in royalty payments to Leo Messi Management in 2024.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was $1,999,488, compared to cash used in investing activities of $137,614 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The 1553% decrease was due to no significant purchases of property and equipment occurring during the six months ended June 30, 2024, offset by the $2,000,000 in proceeds received from the assignment of the _Messi Brand_ to Centric.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, cash provided by financing activities was $1,689,571, a decrease of 79% as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $8,183,515 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was directly related to the completion of the Company’s initial public offering in January 2023.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had working capital of $1,700,344. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, we incurred a loss from operations of $4,305,759, inclusive of $4,325,832 for general and administrative expenses, including higher workforce expenses, stock-based compensation expense, third-party logistics services, professional fees and rent expense for office space, as well as $1,561,692 for increased marketing and ecommerce expenses.\n\nOn March 21, 2024, MGO assigned the Messi License to Centric, which paid the Company $2,000,000 in cash and assumed the obligation to pay the minimum guaranteed amount due to LMM in 2024. Effective as of that date, the Company discontinued operations on _The Messi Store_.\n\nOn February 12, 2024, the SEC deemed the Company’s shelf registration statement on Form S-3 effective. This registration statement contained two prospectuses: 1) a base prospectus that covers the potential offering, issuance, and sale from time to time of our common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities and units in one or more offerings with a total value of up to $100,000,000; and 2) a sales agreement prospectus (\"ATM”) covering the potential offering, issuance, and sale from time to time of shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1,650,000 pursuant to an equity distribution agreement with Maxim Group LLC. On June 7, 2024, MGO entered into an Amendment No. 1 (\"Amendment”) to the equity distribution agreement for the ATM whereby the offering size was amended to reflect an increase in the aggregate gross sales price from $1,650,000 to $3,389,384. As of October 4, 2024, the Company had received gross proceeds of $3,389,384 from sales of shares of our common stock pursuant to the ATM.\n\nIf the Company is unable to generate significant sales growth in the near term and raise additional capital, there is a risk that the Company could default on additional obligations; and could be required to discontinue or significantly reduce the scope of its operations if no other means of financing operations are available. Moreover, any additional equity financing that we obtain may dilute the ownership held by our existing shareholders. The economic dilution to our shareholders will be significant if our stock price does not materially increase, or if the effective price of any sale is below the price paid by a particular shareholder. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities or any other adjustment that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. As such, the aforementioned factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period.\n\n47  \n---  \n  \n**_Year Ended December 31, 2023 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022_**\n\nThe following table provides certain selected financial information for the periods presented:\n\nDecember 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | $ Change | % Change  \n---|---|---|---  \nRevenue, net | $| 3,668,926 | $| - | $| 3,668,926 | 100| %  \nCost of sales | 969,045 | - | 969,045 | 100| %  \nGross profit | 2,699,881 | - | 2,699,881 | 100| %  \nGross profit percentage | 73,58| % | 0| %  \nTotal operating expenses | 8,220,788 | 177,742 | 8,043,046 | 4,525| %  \nOperating loss | (5,520,907| ) | (177,742| ) | (5,343,165| ) | 3,006| %  \nTotal other (income) expenses | (37,281| ) | 186,760 | (224,401| ) | (120| )%  \nNet loss from continuing operations | $| (5,483,626| ) | $| (364,502| ) | $| (5,119,124| ) | 1,404| %  \nNet loss from discontinued operations | (1,886,839| ) | (2,512,855| ) | 626,016 | 25| %  \nNet loss | (7,370,465| ) | (2,877,357| ) | (4,493,108| ) | 156| %  \nLess: net loss attributable to non-controlling interest | (227,061| ) | (294,411| ) | 67,530 | (23| )%  \nNet loss attributable to MGO stockholders | $| (7,143,404| ) | $| (2,582,946| ) | $| (4,560,458| ) | 177| %  \n  \nRevenues\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net revenues were $3,668,926 as compared to $0 reported for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our brand, _Stand Flagpoles,_ was launched in mid-March 2023, accounting for $3,668,926 in sales generated through _Stand Flagpole_ ’s ecommerce website.\n\nCost of Sales\n\nCost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $969,045, compared to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our brand, Stand Flagpoles, was launched in mid-March 2023, accounting for $966,045 in cost of sales.\n\nGross Profit\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, gross profit on revenues was $2,699,881 compared to gross profit of $0 reported for the prior year.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nTotal operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased 4,525% to $8,220,788 as compared to $177,742 for the previous year. The increase was primarily due to a significant increase in marketing and e-commerce expenses coupled with payroll & independent contractor expenses related to the launch of the Stand Flagpole brand, stock-based compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock units and higher legal, accounting and specialty consulting expenses associated with public company overhead expenses resulting from the Company completing its Initial Public Offering in mid-January 2023.\n\nOther (Income) Expenses\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, total other income of $37,281 increased 120% to other expense of $186,760 reported for the prior year. Total other income was primarily associated with interest income on cash balances and remeasurement of foreign currency transactions into U.S. dollars and recorded as finance charges.\n\n48  \n---  \n  \nNet Loss\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net loss from continuing operations was $5,483,626, a 1,404% increase over the net loss of $364,502 reported for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net loss from discontinued operations declined to $1,886,839 from a net loss of $2,512,855 for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Overall, net loss totaled $7,370,465 for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is compared to a net loss of $2,877,357 posted for the year ended December 31, 2022. After factoring net loss of $227,061 and $294,411 for non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, total net loss attributable to MGO stockholders was $7,143,404 or $5.01 loss per share, and $2,582,946, or $2.45 loss per share, respectively.\n\n**Cash Flows**\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, cash on hand was $836,446 as compared to $32,275 as of December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023, cash used in operating activities was $6,978,788, an increase of $5,295,496, compared to $1,683,292 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in cash used in operating activities was mainly driven by an increase in operating loss primarily driven by additional operating costs for _Stand Flagpoles_ operating segment and public company overhead costs, purchases of inventory, decrease in accrued payroll expense and an increase in prepaid expenses over the prior year.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, cash used in our investing activities was $325,964 and $0, respectively.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, cash provided by financing activities was $8,125,711, an increase of $6,416,389 as compared to cash provided by financing activities totaling $1,709,322 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the amount of funds raised in the IPO and exercises of warrants in conjunction with the IPO in January 2023, net of expenses of $1,065,145.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had positive working capital of $602,286. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred a loss from continuing operations of $5,483,626, inclusive of $3,140,371 for marketing and e-commerce expenses, and $5,080,417 for general and administrative fees, including professional fees primarily associated with becoming a public company, namely legal, audit, accounting, SEC reporting, Nasdaq listing and specialized consultants. This compared to a loss from continuing operations as of December 31, 2022 of $364,502, inclusive of $177,742 of selling, general and administrative expenses and $186,760 for financing expenses.\n\nSubsequent to the end of 2023, we filed the S-3 in respect of the ATM. As of October 4, 2024, we have received gross proceeds from sales of our common stock pursuant to the ATM totaling an aggregate $3,389,384.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we raised capital of $1,712,564, net of $212,436 in issuance costs, as a result of the sale of 192,500 shares of common stock in connection with pre-IPO private placements.\n\nWe have continued to incur losses from operations. Moreover, we do not believe we have sufficient cash to meet our anticipated operating costs and capital expenditure requirements through the next 12 months, thus we may need to raise additional capital to fund the Company’s growth and future business operations. However, we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges, we may have to delay or reduce the scope of our planned strategic growth initiatives. Moreover, any additional equity financing that we obtain may dilute the ownership held by our existing shareholders. The economic dilution to our shareholders will be significant if our stock price does not materially increase, or if the effective price of any sale is below the price paid by a particular shareholder. Any debt financing could involve substantial restrictions on activities and creditors could seek additional pledges of some or all of our assets. If we fail to obtain additional funding as needed, we may be forced to cease or scale back operations, and our results, financial conditions and stock price would be adversely affected. As such, these factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period.\n\n49  \n---  \n  \n**Contractual Obligations**\n\nMaterial contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of royalty payments to LMM, principal and interest payments for loans made with PayPal, principal and interest payments for operating leases and other purchase obligations. See Notes 6, 10, 12 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements for amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2023 for these contractual obligations.\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments, and Use of Estimates**\n\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"US GAAP”). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our most critical estimates include those related to revenue recognition, inventories and reserves for excess and obsolescence, accounting for stock-based awards, and income taxes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our existing critical accounting policies which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Since our inception, except for standard operating leases, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.\n\n**Inflation**\n\nOver the past 18 months, inflation has adversely affected our business, financial condition, and results of operations by increasing our overall cost structure, and such affects will be further exacerbated if we are unable to achieve commensurate increases in the prices, we charge our customers. The existence of inflation in the economy has resulted in, and may continue to result in, higher interest rates and capital costs, shipping costs, supply shortages, increased costs of labor, weakening exchange rates, and other similar effects. As a result of inflation, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, cost increases. In addition, poor economic and market conditions, including a potential recession, may negatively impact market sentiment, decreasing the demand for sportswear and outerwear, which would adversely affect our operating income and results of operations. If we are unable to take effective measures in a timely manner to mitigate the impact of inflation, as well as a potential recession, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n**Climate Change**\n\nOur opinion is that neither climate change, nor governmental regulations related to climate change, have had, or are expected to have, any material effect on our operations.\n\n50  \n---  \n  \n**New Accounting Pronouncements**\n\nThere were certain updates recently issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB”), most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n**BUSINESS**\n\nFounded in October 2018 and headquartered in Florida with remote employees and specialty contractors in London, New York and Latin America, we have built a brand acceleration platform with a focus on the acquisition, optimization and monetization of consumer brands across multiple categories. Our mission is to provide customers with unmatched variety, quality and shopping experience, while adding considerable value for MGO’s shareholders.\n\nOur accomplished leadership team encompasses decades of experience in building successful global lifestyle brands, including fashion design, marketing, technology, corporate finance and branding. We strive to continually push innovation and evolution of the consumer product cycle without compromising quality and design integrity. Through our end-to-end, scalable brand-building platform, backed by robust consumer behavioral data, we are engaged in nurturing digitally native brands that will thrive in the modern Direct to Consumer (\"DTC”) economy.\n\nIn 2018, we signed a global licensing agreement with Leo Messi Management (\"LMM”), soccer legend Lionel Messi’s licensing and management company and created the \"Messi Brand” – a line of casual wear and accessories inspired by his trend-setting style and offered on The Messi Store (www.themessistore.com). Designed by the Company’s co-founder and Chief Brand Officer, Virginia Hilfiger, the Messi Brand’s DNA is rooted in Messi’s personal style and emphasizes accessibility, comfort and ease.\n\nIn March 2024, we assigned our global licensing agreement with LMM (\"LMM License Agreement”) to Centric Brands, LLC (\"Centric”). Centric is a global leading lifestyle brand collective that has expertise in product design, development and sourcing; retail and digital commerce; marketing and brand building. Centric designs, sources, markets, and sells high-quality products in the kid’s, men’s and women’s apparel, accessories, beauty, and entertainment categories. The company’s portfolio includes licenses for more than 100 iconic brands, including Calvin Klein®, Tommy Hilfiger®, Nautica®, Spyder®, and Under Armour® in the kid’s category; Joe’s Jeans®, Buffalo®, Hervé Léger®, and IZOD® in the men’s and women’s apparel category; Coach®, Kate Spade®, Michael Kors®, All Saints®, Frye®, Timberland®, Hunter®, and Jessica Simpson® in the accessories category; and in the entertainment category, Disney®, Marvel®, Nickelodeon®, and Warner Brothers® among many others. The company also owns and operates Zac Posen®, Hudson®, Robert Graham®, Avirex®, Fiorelli®, and Taste Beauty® and operates a joint venture brand, Favorite Daughter, with Sara and Erin Foster. The company’s products are sold through leading mass-market retailers, specialty and department stores, and online. The company is headquartered in New York City, with U.S. offices in Los Angeles and Greensboro, and international offices in Asia, Europe, Montreal, and Toronto. In connection with the assignment of the LMM License Agreement, Centric paid MGO $2,000,000 in cash and assumed the obligation to pay €1,500,000 in aggregate royalty payments due to LMM in 2024.\n\nWhile the _Messi Brand_ was previously the only asset in our portfolio through early 2023, our business model has remained centered on strategic expansion through collaborations, licensing, acquisitions and organic development. As our brand portfolio expands, we intend to drive the commercial value of each brand through our own DTC platform methodologies, ensuring that each brand maintains its own unique identity while remaining thoughtfully aligned with the values of our customers.\n\nIn November 2022, we formed MGO Digital LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary which leverages data analytics, advanced technology-enabled marketing and our leadership team’s industry relationships and expertise to identify, incubate and introduce to market new, authentic brand concepts.\n\nIn March 2023, we obtained a royalty-free, worldwide and exclusive license to the assets of Stand CO, LLC, a DTC digitally native brand which offers a line of high quality, residential flagpoles, American flags, solar flagpole light kits, flagpole finials, patriotic-themed apparel and other products. Stand Flagpoles brought to our brand portfolio immediate revenue generation and the opportunity to further demonstrate the benefits of its end-to-end, data-driven brand-building platform to help accelerate and optimize long-term growth. In late March 2023, the Company formed Americana Liberty, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary focused exclusively on supporting the new DTC flagpole and related product line.\n\n51  \n---  \n  \n**_Our Mission_**\n\nMGO is intent on inspiring people worldwide to express their best, most authentic selves through our distinctive lifestyle and consumer product brands; and delivering superior financial performance and value creation through the optimization of our shared services across our scalable brand-building platform.\n\n**_Our Core Values_**\n\nSince our inception, we have consciously fostered a corporate culture in which our core values are deeply ingrained in our identity and serve as a compass to guide our decision-making and business-building processes.

The hard outer shell of the pole, equipped with an advanced rope and pulley system, has been subjected to an anodization process to protect the metal from wear and tear and rusting. The flagpole system uses metal pins to lock sections in place and a pinching sleeve to keep the telescoping sections sturdy. Included in each kit sold is a 4’X6’ premium embroidered American flag, interchangeable premium aluminum gold finial ball, customer lifetime warranty and free shipping. The Roosevelt can also accommodate a solar lighting mount in lieu of the finial.\n\nOther products offered under the _Stand Flagpole_ brand include:\n\n● | Standard telescoping flagpole kit comes with a 16 gauge rustproof aluminum flagpole (20ft or 25ft) capable of flying two flags, rope and pulley system, 3’X5’ American flag, gold ball finial and clips and a ground sleeve.   \n---|---  \n● | High performance U.S. (3’x5’, 4’x6’ and 5’x8’); state (3’x5’) and military (3’x5’) flags with brass grommets  \n● | Selection of gold eagle finial or replacement gold ball finial  \n● | Hardware replacements and parts  \n● | Gift cards  \n  \n52  \n---  \n  \n_Stand Flagpole_ products are sold directly to consumers exclusively through our ecommerce store, found at _www.standflagpoles.com_.\n\nMarketing Strategy for _Stand Flagpoles_\n\nWe utilize primarily digital marketing to broadcast, amplify and showcase our _Stand Flagpole_ product line, leaning heavily into outbound email and digital mobile marketing, as well as social media marketing. Our marketing approach features core messaging focused on featured flash sales, patriotic holiday promotions (namely, President’s Day, Veteran’s Day, Memorial Day and Independence Day) and direct appeals to U.S. military families and supporters and patriotic Americans, in general. Given that 2024 is a national election year, marketing efforts have expanded to include proactive digital outreach to supporters of the national and state Republican and Democratic parties.\n\n**_Social Media Marketing_**\n\nWe use social media, including Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, as well as email, SMS and direct mail as part of our multi-channel approach to marketing our _Stand Flagpole_ line of products, and we encourage our customers to use social media while shopping.\n\n**_Supply Chain Strategy_**\n\nBased on our leadership’s experience in building global consumer product brands for many of the world’s leading companies, we have established, long-standing relationships and key industry knowledge that empowers us to best identify and leverage qualified third-party suppliers and manufacturers to produce our raw materials and finished products.\n\nFor the _Stand Flagpole_ brand, we curate our flagpoles and flagpole accessories from qualified engineering firms and manufacturers based on our stringent, high quality standards for raw materials, design and durability factors and aesthetics.\n\nWe do not own any manufacturing facilities and do not manufacture any of our products. We purchase our finished products from third-party manufacturers on a purchase-order basis and do not have any agreements requiring us to use any specific supplier or manufacturer. We have long-standing relationships with our vendors, built over decades by key members of our team. Chosen based on desired design and production specifications of a particular product or collection, our global network of valued manufacturers are based in Brazil, China, India, Latvia, Mexico, Peru, Portugal, Sri Lanka and the United States. We regularly source new suppliers and manufacturers across the world to support our ongoing innovation and growth, and we carefully evaluate all new suppliers and manufacturers to ensure they share our high standards for quality and precision in manufacturing, ethical working conditions and social and environmental sustainability practices.\n\n**_Warehousing and Logistics_**\n\nMGO manages its ecommerce order fulfillment and inventory warehousing support platform through its partnership with U.S.-based Fulfillment Strategies International (\"FSI”).

Currently, FSI provides MGO with comprehensive 3PL services in support of _Stand Flagpoles_ products sold to customers within the United States.\n\nWe regularly evaluate our distribution infrastructure and capacity to ensure that we remain positioned to timely and efficiently meet our anticipated needs and support continued growth of our brands.\n\n53  \n---  \n  \n**Market Opportunities**\n\n**_Total Addressable Market – Flagpoles_**\n\nIndustry research firm DataIntelo reports that the global flagpole market was $104 million in 2023 and will exceed $274 million by 2024, expanding at a CAGR of 13.99% during 2024-2023. DataIntelo further noted that key drivers of the anticipated growth are rising real estate development, growing tourism industry and growing nationalism and patriotism. (Source: DataIntelo, _Flagpole Market Outlook 2032_ , January 1, 2024.)\n\nVOA reported on January 16, 2024 that \"2024 will go down as one of the most politically consequential years in history, with national elections in more than 60 countries representing half of the world’s population.” 2024 is an election year in the United States and sales of American and state flags, and the flagpoles needed to fly them, are expected to be robust, serving as a source of pride and unity for Americans and embodying the ideals of liberty, justice, freedom, love of country and national purpose.\n\n**_E-Commerce Market Outlook_**\n\nGrand View Research stated in its report, titled _B2C Ecommerce Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report by Product Category, By Region and Segment Forecasts, 2024-2030_, that the global B2C ecommerce market size was valued at $5.47 trillion in 2023 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 19.1% from 2024 to 2030 to reach $17.77 trillion. Grand View notes, \"With the proliferation of technologies, the incorporation of artificial intelligence, machine learning, augmented reality and virtual reality into B2C ecommerce platforms improves the shopping experience by providing interactive product graphical representation, virtual try-ons and customized recommendations, allowing businesses to differentiate themselves and attract customers. Market globalization has created new opportunities for firms to expand their reach beyond domestic borders, tap into foreign markets, and cater to a shifted consumer base, propelling growth in the market. Due to the competitive nature of the business-to-consumer ecommerce sector, firms are compelled to innovate and differentiate themselves through distinct value propositions, creative products, customer-focused strategies, and improved shopping experiences.\n\n**_Retail Landscape Realities_**\n\nLifestyle brands, whether accessible or prestige, have faced structural shifts in the retail landscape that have made it more challenging for them to succeed. Those challenges include:\n\n● | **_Decline of Traditional Wholesale Channels:_** It is estimated by analysts at UBS that between 40,000 to 50,000 retail stores in the United States will close down over the next five years. UBS sees the most closures shaking out among clothing and accessories retailers, consumer electronics businesses and home furnishing chains, or about 23,500 stores cumulatively within these categories by 2026. (Source: CNBC, UBS Expects 50,000 Store Closures in the U.S. Over the Next 5 Years After Pandemic Pause, April 13, 2022)  \n---|---  \n● | **_Direct-to-Consumer, or DTC, as an Essential Channel for Every Brand:_** Given the growth in online and the challenges associated with traditional wholesale channels, brands are increasingly seeking DTC channels but often lack the financial or human capital to build them.  \n● | **_Larger, More Fractured Discovery Landscape:_** According to Publicis Sapient, 87% of shoppers today begin product searches online, meaning that younger customers are focused on direct search for brands they already know (Source: Publicis Sapient, \"_Shopper-First Retailing – The New Rules of Retail from the Actions, Voices and Eyes of Today’s Consumers_ ”, 2018).  \n● | **_Growing Importance of Data_** : We believe that data and data analytics is critical to helping brands assess their product and efficiently acquire customers and improve customer experience. Through traditional wholesale channels, brands receive very minimal data, and the data they do receive is often a season old.  \n  \n**Competitive Landscape**\n\nCompetition in the global consumer products industry is principally based on product quality, innovation, style, price, brand image, distribution model and definitive standards for customer experience and service. Generally speaking, our industry is intensely competitive, and many companies who may be perceived as our competitors have substantially greater financial, distribution and marketing resources, as well as greater brand awareness.\n\nCompetition within the U.S. flagpole and flagpole accessory market is comprised mainly of small specialty outdoor retailers, many of which have adopted direct-to-consumer ecommerce models to market their products to active and veteran miliary families, patriotic Americans, schools/universities and U.S., state and local government agencies. Among them are Liberty Flagpoles, United States Flag Store, American Flagpole & Flag Co. and Uncommon US. Large home and outdoor retailers, such as Home Depot and Lowes, also offer flagpole products.\n\n54  \n---  \n  \n**_Our Competitive Strengths_**\n\nWe believe that MGO Global stands to benefit from a number of competitive differentiators that serve to set our Company apart from other lifestyle brand portfolio companies. Chief among them are:\n\n● | **Proven, Premium Lifestyle Brand Builders Lead MGO.** Our Company’s design and production team is led by 30-year industry veteran Ginny Hilfiger, younger sibling of Tommy Hilfiger, a globally renowned pioneer of classic American cool style. During her 15-year tenure as EVP of Design at Tommy Hilfiger’s namesake apparel brand, Ginny was the visionary behind Tommy Jeans, the women’s sportswear and junior lines, the H Hilfiger collection for Federated Department Stores and the successful brand collaboration between Tommy and supermodel Gigi Hadid – just to name a few key achievements. Following her run of successes at Tommy, she launched her own signature brand \"Ginny H” before being recruited as Creative Director for FILA Global, charged with revamping FILA’s brand DNA globally. MGO’s C-suite also includes Julian Groves, Chief Operating Officer, who brings our Company over 25 years of experience in global brand strategy and expansion for lifestyle brands that have included J. Brand, True Religion, Guess and Burberry; and Chief Executive Officer, Maximiliano Ojeda, an international business executive and entrepreneur who, along with Ginny Hilfiger, co-founded MGO and today guides and directs our global business operations and brand-building architecture.  \n---|---  \n● | **Established Relationships with Many of the World’s Leading Consumer Product Manufacturers.** Through our team’s collective experience and sphere of influence in the global consumer product industry, we have knowledge of and direct relationships with many of the world’s best manufacturers of premium materials and finished goods. Chosen based on desired design and production specifications of a particular product or collection, our global network of valued manufacturers span the world with operations in Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Latvia, Mexico, Peru, Portugal, Sri Lanka and the United States.  \n● | **Deep Connections with Our Loyal and Passionate Customers.** Younger generations are embracing social media platforms and mobile apps, in particular, as a means for community building and discovery. This seamless exchange of community-based inspiration encourages like-minded consumers to purchase products that allow for unapologetic self-expression that reflects their passions and values.   \n● | **Data Driven, Low-Risk Merchandizing and Smarter Marketing Models.** We employ a data-driven approach to design, merchandizing and inventory planning and allocation to ensure we deliver products that meet and exceed our customers’ high expectations for quality, precision and style. We have excellent visibility into our customers’ preferences through their purchasing history and direct feedback, which we leverage to inform our purchasing decisions. Through our vertical sourcing model and global network of manufacturers, coupled with our in-house IT and marketing teams, we have the flexibility to respond quickly to prevailing sales trends and make adjustments to our current offerings, if or whenever necessary. We utilize a read and react testing approach with shallow initial buys and data-driven repurchasing decisions to iterate our new product offerings, thereby minimizing our inventory risks and optimizing our gross profit margins on sales. Further, we employ multiple digital marketing tools and machine learning technologies to identify new customers and markets, capture key customer insights, uncover hidden patterns and accelerate our creative marketing processes to achieve higher traffic volume to our ecommerce store(s), higher conversion rates and higher customer lifetime value.  \n  \n**Our Growth Strategies**\n\nThe key elements of our growth strategy are centered on:\n\n● | **Driving Leverage in Operational Efficiency**. We are focused on using our customer and market data to drive actionable insights and improve key aspects of our brand management platform’s operations. Moreover, we plan to further deepen customer relationships with personalization and customization through the development and launch of a customer loyalty program. Through this program, we expect to tailor our marketing messages, promotions and product recommendations to each unique customer’s preferences with a goal of enhancing customer engagement and capturing greater spend.  \n---|---  \n  \n55  \n---  \n  \n● | **Implement New Technologies.** We will continue to enhance our ecommerce functionality with tools for product recommendations, enhanced payment options (e.g., buy now pay later), and improved returns processes to drive conversions and increase order value. We also believe there is an opportunity to further leverage our proprietary artificial intelligence-powered and algorithm-driven DTC marketing system to drive more efficient customer acquisition, conversion and retention marketing strategies.   \n---|---  \n● | **Growing through Strategic Acquisitions and Brand Partnerships and Collaborations.** Capitalizing on the platform infrastructure we created to support the development, launch and success of _The Messi Brand_ and _Stand Flagpoles_ , we will actively look to identify and pursue new opportunities to incubate and vertically integrate other brand and brand concepts into our brand portfolio, replicating and scaling our licensing model. In addition, we aim to explore incremental growth opportunities to acquire existing lifestyle brands, products or intellectual property that will complement our brand mix and appeal to our customers. Finally, it is common practice in the consumer products industry to establish brand collaborations with other leading lifestyle brands to penetrate new product categories, enter new markets and expand into new geographic regions. In this regard, we expect to seek out opportunities to identify and pursue brand collaborations with premium lifestyle brands with the goal of leveraging and cross-marketing new co-branded products to existing and prospective customer bases of our brands to fuel our respective revenue growth.  \n  \n**Intellectual Property**\n\n**_Stand Flagpoles License_**\n\nOn March 13, 2023, MGO obtained a royalty free, worldwide and exclusive license to the use of certain assets of Stand Co., LLC (\"Stand”) for all purposes in exchange for payment of $1.00 by the Company. The license is in perpetuity.\n\nOn May 11, 2023, we executed a 12-month consulting agreement with Jason Harward (\"Consultant”), the owner of Stand and nephew of Matt Harward, MGO’s former Chief Marketing Officer. The consulting agreement compensation terms were $350,000 payable in two installments, the first installment was paid in September 2023 and second installment was paid in January 2024. The compensation terms included 15,000 restricted stock units awarded on January 31, 2024 which vest over the remaining life of the consulting agreement, which ended May 2024.\n\nLicensed assets include all rights to all stock keeping units (\"SKU”) of Stand sold under the names: \"Roosevelt Premium 25ft Telescoping Flag Pole Kit,” \"20FT Telescoping Flag Pole Kit” and \"LED Solar Flag Pole Light;” any intellectual property and other intangible property related to SKUs, including but not limited to all rights to a brand name \"Stand Flagpoles,” domain and website standflagpoles.com, the Meta pages associated with \"Stand Flagpoles” brand name (in Facebook and Instagram); all manufacturer, distributor and customer contracts and relationships for SKUs; marketing materials; any commercialization rights; domain and administrative access to Stand’s Shopify account, Facebook Assets & Accounts; all historical digital and non-digital assets; and customer database since inception.\n\n**_Other Intellectual Property_**\n\nThis Registration Statement on Form S-1 may also contain trademarks, service marks and trade names of third parties, which are the property of their respective owners. Our use or display of third parties’ trademarks, service marks and trade names or products in this Registration Statement is not intended to, and does not imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship by us. Solely for convenience, the trademarks, service marks and trade names referred to in this Registration Statement may appear without the ®, TM or SM symbols, but the omission of such references is not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or the right of the applicable owner of these trademarks, service marks and trade names.\n\n**Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters**\n\nOur business is subject to a number of laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations include federal and state consumer protection laws protecting the privacy of consumer information and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. In particular, under federal and state privacy laws and regulations, we must provide notice to consumers of our policies on sharing sensitive information with third parties, advance notice of any changes to our policies and, in some instances, we may be obligated to give customers the right to prevent sharing of their sensitive information with unaffiliated third parties. The growth and demand for e-commerce could result in more stringent consumer protection laws that impose additional compliance burdens on online companies. These consumer protection laws could result in substantial compliance costs.\n\n56  \n---  \n  \nIn many jurisdictions, there is currently great uncertainty whether or how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. In addition, new tax regulations in jurisdictions where we do not now collect state and local taxes may subject us to the obligation to collect and remit state and local taxes or subject us to additional state and local sales and income taxes, or to requirements intended to assist states with their tax collection efforts. New legislation or regulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and e-commerce could result in significant additional taxes on our business. These taxes or tax collection obligations could have an adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations. Further, there is a possibility that we may be subject to significant fines or other payments for any past failures to comply with these requirements.\n\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations that could affect our business, including those promulgated under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the Textile Fiber Product Identification Act, the rules and regulations of the Consumer Products Safety Commission and various environmental laws and regulations. Our operations also are subject to various international trade agreements and regulations. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental regulations, current governmental regulations may change or become more stringent or unforeseen events may occur, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\n\n**Our Headquarters**\n\nOur principal corporate address is 1515 SE 17th Street, Suite 121/#460596, Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33346 and our telephone number is 347-913-3316.

The information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our websites is not a part of this Registration Statement on Form S-1. We have included our website address in this S-1 solely as an inactive textual reference.\n\n**Employees**\n\nAs of September 27, 2024, we had 7 full-time employees. We also utilize 12 domestic and foreign independent contractors to supplement our workforce. We consider our relationships with our consultants and independent contractors to be good, and we have not been a party to any employment-related claims, including sexual, age, racial or other discriminatory allegations.\n\n**Legal Proceedings**\n\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\n\n**MANAGEMENT**\n\nThe following table and biographical summaries set forth information, including principal occupation and business experience about our directors and executive officers as of October 4, 2024:\n\n**Name** | **Age** | **Position**  \n---|---|---  \nMaximiliano Ojeda | 47 | Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  \nVirginia Hilfiger | 61 | Director and Chief Brand Officer  \nJulian Groves | 52 | Director and Chief Operating Officer  \nDana Perez | 47 | Chief Financial Officer  \nPing Rawson (1) (3) | 50 | Independent Director  \nObie McKenzie (1) (2) | 79 | Independent Director   \nJeffrey Lerner (2) (3) | 45 | Independent Director  \nPaul Wahlgren(1) (2) | 57 | Independent Director   \n  \n(1) Member of the audit committee\n\n(2) Member of the compensation committee\n\n(3) Member of the nominating and corporate governance committee\n\n57  \n---  \n  \n**_Maximiliano Ojeda, Co-Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer —_** Mr. Ojeda is the co-founder of MGO Global and has served as our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer since the Company’s inception in November 2021.

The risk oversight process includes receiving regular reports from board committees and members of senior management to enable our Board to understand our risk identification, risk management, and risk mitigation strategies with respect to areas of potential material risk, including operations, finance, legal, regulatory, cybersecurity, strategic, and reputational risk. Our Board recognizes that it is neither possible nor prudent to eliminate all risk. Indeed, purposeful and appropriate risk-taking is essential for our Company to be competitive on a global basis and to achieve its objectives.\n\n**Board of Directors**\n\nOur business and affairs are managed under the direction of our Board. Our Board consists of six directors, four of whom qualify as \"independent” under the listing standards of Nasdaq.\n\nDirectors serve until the next annual meeting and until their successors are elected and qualified. Officers are appointed to serve until their successors have been elected and qualified.\n\n**Director Independence**\n\nOur Board is composed of a majority of \"independent directors” as defined under the rules of Nasdaq. We use the definition of \"independence” applied by Nasdaq to make this determination. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that an \"independent director” is a person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the company’s board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Nasdaq listing rules provide that a director cannot be considered independent if:\n\n● | the director is, or at any time during the past three (3) years was, an employee of the company;  \n---|---  \n● | the director or a family member of the director accepted any compensation from the company in excess of $120,000 during any period of twelve (12) consecutive months within the three (3) years preceding the independence determination (subject to certain exemptions, including, among other things, compensation for board or board committee service);  \n● | the director or a family member of the director is a partner in, controlling shareholder of, or an executive officer of an entity to which the company made, or from which the company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed 5% of the recipient’s gross revenue for that year or $200,000, whichever is greater (subject to certain exemptions);  \n● | the director or a family member of the director is employed as an executive officer of an entity where, at any time during the past three (3) years, any of the executive officers of the company served on the compensation committee of such other entity; or  \n● | the director or a family member of the director is a current partner of the company’s outside auditor, or at any time during the past three (3) years was a partner or employee of the company’s outside auditor, and who worked on the company’s audit.  \n  \nUnder such definitions, our Board has undertaken a review of the independence of each director.

The 2022 Plan governs equity awards to our employees, directors, officers, consultants and other eligible participants. Initially, the maximum number of shares of our Common Stock that may be subject to awards under the 2022 Plan is 218,647. The maximum number of shares that are subject to awards under the 2022 Plan is subject to an annual increase equal to the lesser of (i) 50,000 shares of our Common Stock; (ii) a number of shares of our Common Stock equal to 4% of the prior year’s maximum number or (iii) such number of shares of our Common Stock as determined by the 2022 Plan administrator. The 2022 Plan was made effective on January 11, 2023.\n\nThe purpose of 2022 Plan is to attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of substantial responsibility, to provide additional incentive to employees, directors and consultants, and to promote the success of our business. The administrator of the 2022 Plan may, in its sole discretion, amend, alter, suspend or terminate the 2022 Plan, or any part thereof, at any time and for any reason. We will obtain stockholder approval of any 2022 Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the administration of equity-based awards. The 2022 Plan automatically will terminate on August 15, 2032, unless it is terminated sooner.\n\n**_Authorized Shares_**\n\nInitially, the maximum number of shares of our Common Stock that may be subject to awards under the 2022 Plan is 218,647. The maximum number of shares that are subject to awards under the 2022 Plan is subject to an annual increase equal to the lesser of (i) 50,000 shares of our Common Stock; (ii) a number of shares of our Common Stock equal to 4% of the prior year’s maximum number or (iii) such number of shares of our Common Stock as determined by the 2022 Plan administrator.\n\n68  \n---  \n  \nAdditionally, if any award issued pursuant to the 2022 Plan expires or becomes unexercisable without having been exercised in full, is surrendered pursuant to an exchange program, as provided in the 2022 Plan, or, with respect to restricted stock, restricted stock units (\"RSUs”), performance units or performance shares, is forfeited to or repurchased by us due to the failure to vest, the unpurchased shares (or for awards other than stock options or stock appreciation rights the forfeited or repurchased shares) which were subject thereto will become available for future grant or sale under the 2022 Plan (unless the 2022 Plan has terminated). With respect to stock appreciation rights, only shares actually issued pursuant to a stock appreciation right will cease to be available under the 2022 Plan; all remaining shares under stock appreciation rights will remain available for future grant or sale under the 2022 Plan (unless the 2022 Plan has terminated). Shares that have actually been issued under the 2022 Plan under any award will not be returned to the 2022 Plan and will not become available for future distribution under the 2022 Plan; provided, however, that if shares issued pursuant to awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares or performance units are repurchased by the Company or are forfeited to the Company due to the failure to vest, such shares will become available for future grant under the 2022 Plan. Shares used to pay the exercise price of an award or to satisfy the tax withholdings related to an award will become available for future grant or sale under the 2022 Plan. To the extent an award under the 2022 Plan is paid out in cash rather than shares, such cash payment will not result in reducing the number of shares available for issuance under the 2022 Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing and, subject to adjustment as provided in the 2022 Plan, the maximum number of shares that may be issued upon the exercise of incentive stock options will equal the aggregate share number stated above, plus, to the extent allowable under Section 422 of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder, any shares that become available for issuance under the 2022 Plan in accordance with the foregoing.\n\nOn April 12, 2024, the Board unanimously authorized and approved an amendment (\"Plan Amendment”) to MGO’s 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2022 Plan”) to increase the number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock, par value $0.00001 per share, (\"Common Stock”) reserved for issuance under the 2022 Plan by an additional 182,541 shares of Common Stock. Such increase resulted in a total of 451,188 shares of Common Stock being reserved under the 2022 Plan. On April 17, 2024 (the \"Record Date”), a majority of our stockholders consented to the Plan Amendment.\n\nAs of October 4, 2024, all shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 2022 Plan have been issued, leaving zero shares available for future issuance.\n\n**_Plan Administration_**\n\nOne or more committees appointed by our Board will administer the 2022 Plan. Initially, the Compensation Committee shall administer the 2022 Plan. In addition, if we determine it is desirable to qualify transactions under the 2022 Plan as exempt under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act, such transactions will be structured with the intent that they satisfy the requirements for exemption under Rule 16b-3. Subject to the provisions of the 2022 Plan, the administrator has the power to administer the 2022 Plan and make all determinations deemed necessary or advisable for administering the 2022 Plan, including the power to determine the fair market value of our Common Stock, select the service providers to whom awards may be granted, determine the number of shares covered by each award, approve forms of award agreements for use under the 2022 Plan, determine the terms and conditions of awards (including the exercise price, the time or times at which the awards may be exercised, any vesting acceleration or waiver or forfeiture restrictions and any restriction or limitation regarding any award or the shares relating thereto), construe and interpret the terms of the 2022 Plan and awards granted under it, prescribe, amend and rescind rules relating to the 2022 Plan, rules and regulations relating to sub-plans established for the purpose of facilitating compliance with applicable non-U.S. laws, easing the administration of the 2022 Plan and/or for qualifying for favorable tax treatment under applicable non-U.S. laws, in each case as the administrator may deem necessary or advisable and modify or amend each award (subject to the provisions of the 2022 Plan), including the discretionary authority to extend the post-termination exercisability period of awards and to extend the maximum term of an option or stock appreciation right (subject to the provisions of the 2022 Plan), to allow participants to satisfy withholding tax obligations in a manner permissible under the 2022 Plan, to authorize any person to execute on behalf of us any instrument required to effect the grant of an award previously granted by the administrator and to allow a participant to defer the receipt of payment of cash or the delivery of shares that would otherwise be due to such participant under an award. The administrator also has the authority to allow participants the opportunity to transfer outstanding awards to a financial institution or other person or entity selected by the administrator and to institute an exchange program by which outstanding awards may be surrendered or cancelled in exchange for awards of the same type which may have a higher or lower exercise price or different terms, awards of a different type or cash, or by which the exercise price of an outstanding award is increased or reduced. The administrator’s decisions, interpretations and other actions are final and binding on all participants.\n\n69  \n---  \n  \n**_Eligibility_**\n\nAwards under the 2022 Plan, other than incentive stock options, may be granted to employees (including officers and directors) of the Company or a parent or subsidiary, members of our Board, or consultants engaged to render bona fide services to the Company or a parent or subsidiary. Incentive stock options may be granted only to our employees of the Company or a subsidiary, provided the services (i) are not in connection with the offer or sale of securities in a capital-raising transaction, and (ii) do not directly promote or maintain a market for our securities, in each case, within the meaning of Form S-8 promulgated under the Securities Act, and provided further, that a consultant will include only those persons to whom the issuance of Shares may be registered under Form S-8 promulgated under the Securities Act.\n\n**_Stock Options_**\n\nStock options may be granted under the 2022 Plan. The exercise price of options granted under the 2022 Plan generally must at least be equal to the fair market value of our Common Stock on the date of grant. The term of each option will be as stated in the applicable award agreement; provided, however, that the term may be no more than 10 years from the date of grant. The administrator will determine the methods of payment of the exercise price of an option, which may include cash, shares or other property acceptable to the administrator, as well as other types of consideration permitted by applicable law. After the termination of service of an employee, director or consultant, they may exercise their option for the period of time stated in their option agreement. In the absence of a specified time in an award agreement, if termination is due to death or disability, the option will remain exercisable for nine months. In all other cases, in the absence of a specified time in an award agreement, the option will remain exercisable for three months following the termination of service. An option may not be exercised later than the expiration of its term. Subject to the provisions of the 2022 Plan, the administrator determines the other terms of options.\n\n**_Stock Appreciation Rights_**\n\nStock appreciation rights may be granted under the 2022 Plan. Stock appreciation rights allow the recipient to receive the appreciation in the fair market value of our Common Stock between the exercise date and the date of grant. Stock appreciation rights may not have a term exceeding 10 years. After the termination of service of an employee, director or consultant, they may exercise their stock appreciation right for the period of time stated in their stock appreciation right agreement. In the absence of a specified time in an award agreement, if termination is due to death or disability, the stock appreciation rights will remain exercisable for nine months. In all other cases, in the absence of a specified time in an award agreement, the stock appreciation rights will remain exercisable for three months following the termination of service. However, in no event may a stock appreciation right be exercised later than the expiration of its term. Subject to the provisions of the 2022 Plan, the administrator determines the other terms of stock appreciation rights, including when such rights become exercisable and whether to pay any increased appreciation in cash or with shares of our Common Stock, or a combination thereof, except that the per share exercise price for the shares to be issued pursuant to the exercise of a stock appreciation right will be no less than 100% of the fair market value per share on the date of grant.\n\n**_Restricted Stock_**\n\nRestricted stock may be granted under the 2022 Plan. Restricted stock awards are grants of shares of our Common Stock that vest in accordance with terms and conditions established by the administrator. The administrator will determine the number of shares of restricted stock granted to any employee, director or consultant and, subject to the provisions of the 2022 Plan, will determine the terms and conditions of such awards. The administrator may impose whatever conditions to vesting it determines to be appropriate (for example, the administrator may set restrictions based on the achievement of specific performance goals or continued service to us); provided, however, that the administrator, in its sole discretion, may accelerate the time at which any restrictions will lapse or be removed. Recipients of restricted stock awards generally will have voting and dividend rights with respect to such shares upon grant without regard to vesting, unless the administrator provides otherwise. Shares of restricted stock that do not vest are subject to the Company’s right of repurchase or forfeiture.\n\n**_Restricted Stock Units_**\n\nRSUs may be granted under the 2022 Plan. RSUs are bookkeeping entries representing an amount equal to the fair market value of one share of our Common Stock. Subject to the provisions of the 2022 Plan, the administrator determines the terms and conditions of RSUs, including the vesting criteria and the form and timing of payment. The administrator may set vesting criteria based upon the achievement of Company-wide, divisional, business unit or individual goals (including continued employment or service), applicable federal or state securities laws or any other basis determined by the administrator in its discretion. The administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned RSUs in the form of cash, in shares of our Common Stock or in some combination thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the administrator, in its sole discretion, may accelerate the time at which any vesting requirements will be deemed satisfied.\n\n70  \n---  \n  \n**_Performance Awards_**\n\nPerformance awards may be granted under the 2022 Plan. Performance awards are awards that will result in a payment to a participant only if performance goals established by the administrator are achieved or the awards otherwise vest. The administrator will set objectives or vesting provisions, that, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the value the payout for the performance awards. The administrator may set vesting criteria based on the achievement of company-wide, divisional, business unit, or individual goals (including, but not limited to, continued employment or service), or any other basis determined by the administrator in its discretion. Each performance award’s threshold, target, and maximum payout values are established by the administrator on or before the grant date. After the grant of a performance award, the administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any performance objectives or other vesting provisions for such performance award. The administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned performance awards in the form of cash, in shares, or in some combination thereof.\n\n**_Non-Employee Directors_**\n\nThe 2022 Plan provides that all non-employee directors will be eligible to receive all types of awards (except for incentive stock options) under the 2022 Plan. The 2022 Plan includes a maximum limit of $100,000 of equity awards that may be granted to a non-employee director in any fiscal year, increased to $200,000 in connection with his or her initial service. For purposes of this limitation, the value of equity awards is based on the grant date fair value (determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States). Any equity awards granted to a person for their services as an employee, or for their services as a consultant (other than as a non-employee director), will not count for purposes of the limitation. The maximum limit does not reflect the intended size of any potential compensation or equity awards to our non-employee directors.\n\n**_Non-transferability of Awards_**\n\nUnless the administrator provides otherwise, the 2022 Plan generally does not allow for the transfer of awards other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and only the recipient of an award may exercise an award during their lifetime. If the administrator makes an award transferrable, such award will contain such additional terms and conditions as the administrator deems appropriate.\n\n**_Certain Adjustments_**\n\nIn the event of certain changes in our capitalization, to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits available under the 2022 Plan, the administrator will adjust the number and class of shares that may be delivered under the 2022 Plan or the number, and price of shares covered by each outstanding award and the numerical share limits set forth in the 2022 Plan.\n\n**_Dissolution or Liquidation_**\n\nIn the event of our proposed liquidation or dissolution, the administrator will notify participants as soon as practicable and all awards will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed transaction.\n\n71  \n---  \n  \n**_Merger or Change in Control_**\n\nThe 2022 Plan provides that in the event of our merger with or into another corporation or entity or a \"change in control” (as defined in the 2022 Plan), each outstanding award will be treated as the administrator determines, including, without limitation, that (i) awards will be assumed, or substantially equivalent awards will be substituted, by the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof) with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and prices; (ii) upon written notice to a participant, that the participant’s awards will terminate upon or immediately prior to the consummation of such merger or change in control; (iii) outstanding awards will vest and become exercisable, realizable or payable, or restrictions applicable to an award will lapse, in whole or in part, prior to or upon consummation of such merger or change in control and, to the extent the administrator determines, terminate upon or immediately prior to the effectiveness of such merger or change in control; (iv) (A) the termination of an award in exchange for an amount of cash or property, if any, equal to the amount that would have been attained upon the exercise of such award or realization of the participant’s rights as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction the administrator determines in good faith that no amount would have been attained upon the exercise of such award or realization of the participant’s rights, then such award may be terminated by us without payment) or (B) the replacement of such award with other rights or property selected by the administrator in its sole discretion; or (v) any combination of the foregoing. The administrator will not be obligated to treat all awards, all awards a participant holds, or all awards of the same type, similarly. In the event that awards (or portion thereof) are not assumed or substituted for in the event of a merger or change in control, the participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise all of their outstanding options and stock appreciation rights, including shares as to which such awards would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on restricted stock and RSUs or performance awards will lapse and, with respect to awards with performance-based vesting, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at 100% of target levels and all other terms and conditions met, in all cases, unless specifically provided otherwise under the applicable award agreement or other written agreement between the participant and us or any of our subsidiaries or parents, as applicable. If an option or stock appreciation right is not assumed or substituted in the event of a merger or change in control, the administrator will notify the participant in writing or electronically that the option or stock appreciation right will be exercisable for a period of time determined by the administrator in its sole discretion and the vested option or stock appreciation right will terminate upon the expiration of such period.\n\nFor awards granted to an outside director, the outside director will fully vest in and have the right to exercise options and/or stock appreciation rights as to all of the shares underlying such award, including those shares which would not be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on restricted stock and RSUs will lapse, and, with respect to awards with performance-based vesting, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at one hundred percent (100%) of target levels and all other terms and conditions met, unless specifically provided otherwise under the applicable award agreement or other written agreement between the participant and us or any of our subsidiaries or parents, as applicable.\n\n**_Clawback_**\n\nAwards will be subject to any Company clawback policy that we are required to adopt pursuant to the listing standards of Nasdaq or any other national securities exchange or association on which our securities are listed or as is otherwise required by the Dodd-Frank Act or other applicable laws. The administrator also may specify in an award agreement that the participant’s rights, payments or benefits with respect to an award will be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events. The administrator may require a participant to forfeit, return or reimburse us all or a portion of the award or shares issued under the award, any amounts paid under the award and any payments or proceeds paid or provided upon disposition of the shares issued under the award in order to comply with such clawback policy or applicable laws.\n\n**_Amendment and Termination_**\n\nThe administrator has the authority to amend, suspend or terminate the 2022 Plan provided such action does not impair the existing rights of any participant. The 2022 Plan automatically will terminate on August 15, 2032, unless it is terminated sooner.\n\n**Equity Compensation Plan Information**\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, there have been no grants made under the 2022 Plan.\n\n**PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS**\n\nThe following table sets forth certain information, as of October 4, 2024 with respect to the holdings of (1) each person who is the beneficial owner of more than 5% of Company voting stock, (2) each of our directors, (3) each executive officer, and (4) all of our current directors and executive officers as a group.\n\nBeneficial ownership of the voting stock is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and includes any shares of company voting stock over which a person exercises sole or shared voting or investment power, or of which a person has a right to acquire ownership at any time within 60 days of October 4, 2024.

Because this is a summary description, it does not contain all of the information that may be important to you. For a more detailed description of our capital stock, you should refer to the applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \"DGCL”), our Certificate of Incorporation, or Charter, and our Bylaws as currently in effect. Copies of our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws are included as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part._\n\n**General**\n\nWe are authorized to issue 170,000,000 shares of capital stock, 150,000,000 shares of which are Common Stock, and 20,000,000 shares of which are preferred stock, par $0.00001 per share. As of [*], 2024, there were [*] holders of record of our Common Stock.\n\n**Common Stock**\n\nThe holders of our Common Stock are entitled to the following rights:\n\n**_Voting Rights_**. Each share of our Common Stock entitles its holder to one vote per share on all matters to be voted or consented upon by the stockholders.\n\n**_Dividend Rights_**. Subject to limitations under the DGCL, holders of our Common Stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends or other distributions, if any, as may be declared by our Board out of funds legally available therefor.\n\n**_Liquidation Rights_**. In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our business, the holders of our Common Stock are entitled to share ratably in the assets available for distribution after the payment of all of our debts and other liabilities.\n\n**_Other Matters_**. The holders of our Common Stock that are not to be issued upon conversion of the convertible promissory notes have no subscription, redemption or conversion privileges; in addition, such Common Stock does not entitle its holders to preemptive rights. All of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock are fully paid and non-assessable.\n\n74  \n---  \n  \n**Preferred Stock**\n\nAs of [*], 2024, we have not issued any shares of preferred stock. However, our Board has the authority to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more classes or series and to fix the designations, powers, preferences, and rights, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof including dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any class or series, without further vote or action by the stockholders.\n\nWhile we do not currently have any plans for the issuance of any shares of preferred stock, the issuance of shares of preferred stock could adversely affect the rights of the holders of Common Stock and, therefore, reduce the value of the Common Stock. It is not possible to state the actual effect of the issuance of any shares of preferred stock on the rights of holders of the Common Stock until the Board determines the specific rights of the holders of the preferred stock; however, these effects may include:\n\n● | Restricting dividends on the Common Stock;  \n---|---  \n● | Diluting the voting power of the Common Stock;  \n● | Impairing the liquidation rights of the Common Stock; or  \n● | Delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company without further action by the stockholders.  \n  \n**Options**\n\nNone.\n\n**Notes**\n\nNone.\n\n**Warrants**\n\nNone.\n\n**Exclusive Forum**\n\nOur Charter provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company to the Company or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to said Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage lawsuits against us or our directors or officers. The provision does not apply to any actions arising under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as is set forth in Article VII of our Certificate of Incorporation. _See_ \"_Risk Factors—Our Certificate of Incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us_.”\n\n**Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law**\n\nWe are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL regulating corporate takeovers. This statute prevents certain Delaware corporations, under certain circumstances, from engaging in a \"business combination” with:\n\n● | a stockholder who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, otherwise known as an interested stockholder;  \n---|---  \n● | an affiliate of an interested stockholder; or  \n  \n75  \n---  \n  \n● | an associate of an interested stockholder, for three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder.  \n---|---  \n  \nA \"business combination” includes a merger or sale of more than 10% of our assets. However, the above provisions of Section 203 do not apply if:\n\n● | our Board approves the transaction that made the stockholder an \"interested stockholder,” prior to the date of the transaction; or  \n---|---  \n● | after the completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, that stockholder owned at least 85% of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, other than statutorily excluded shares of Common Stock.  \n  \n**Transfer Agent and Registrar**\n\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our Common Stock is Transhare Corporation, located at Bayside Center 1, 17755 US Highway 19N, Suite 140, Clearwater, Florida 33764. Transhare’s phone number is 303-662-1112 and its website is www.transhare.com.\n\n**Listing**\n\nOur Common Stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \"MGOL.”\n\n**DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES WE ARE OFFERING**\n\n**Common Stock**\n\nThe material terms and provisions of our Common Stock are described under the caption \"Description of Securities.”\n\n**Pre-funded Warrants to be issued in this Offering**\n\nThe following summary of certain terms and conditions of the Pre-funded Warrants is not complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the provisions of Pre-funded Warrant, the form of which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. Prospective investors should carefully review the terms and provisions of the form of Pre-funded Warrant for a complete description of the terms and conditions of the Pre-funded Warrants.\n\n_General_\n\nThe term \"pre-funded” refers to the fact that the purchase price of the Pre-funded Warrants in this offering includes almost the entire exercise price that will be paid under the Pre-funded Warrants, except for a nominal remaining exercise price of $0.00001. The purpose of the Pre-funded Warrants is to enable investors that may have restrictions on their ability to beneficially own more than 4.99% (or, at the election of the holder, 9.99%) of our outstanding Common Stock following the consummation of this offering the opportunity to invest capital into the Company without triggering their ownership restrictions, by receiving Pre-funded Warrants in lieu of shares of our Common Stock which would result in such ownership of more than 4.99% (or, at the election of the holder, 9.99%), and receiving the ability to exercise their option to purchase the shares underlying the Pre-funded Warrants at a nominal price at a later date.\n\n_Form_\n\nThe Pre-funded Warrants will be issued as individual warrant agreements to the investors. You should review the form of Pre-funded Warrant, filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, for a complete description of the terms and conditions applicable to the Pre-funded Warrants.\n\n76  \n---  \n  \n_Exercisability_\n\nThe Pre-funded Warrants are exercisable at any time after their original issuance. The Pre-funded Warrants will be exercisable, at the option of each holder, in whole or in part, by delivering to us a duly executed exercise notice accompanied by payment in full in immediately available funds for the number of shares of our Common Stock purchased upon such exercise (except in the case of a cashless exercise as described below). A holder (together with its affiliates) may not exercise any portion of the Pre-funded Warrant to the extent that the holder would own more than 4.99% (or, at the election of the holder, 9.99%) of the outstanding Common Stock immediately after exercise, except that upon at least 61 days’ prior notice from the holder to us, the holder may increase the amount of ownership of outstanding stock after exercising the holder’s Pre-funded Warrants up to 9.99% of the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the Pre-funded Warrants.\n\n_Duration and Exercise Price_\n\nThe exercise price per whole share of our Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Pre-funded Warrants is $0.00001 per share of Common Stock. The Pre-funded Warrants will be immediately exercisable and may be exercised at any time until the Pre-funded Warrants are exercised in full.\n\n_Cashless Exercise_\n\nIf, at any time after the issuance of the Pre-funded Warrants, the holder exercises its pre-funded warrants and a registration statement registering the issuance of the shares of Common Stock underlying the Pre-funded Warrants under the Securities Act is not then effective or available (or a prospectus is not available for the resale of shares of Common Stock underlying the Pre-funded Warrants), then in lieu of making the cash payment otherwise contemplated to be made to us upon such exercise in payment of the aggregate exercise price, the holder shall instead receive upon such exercise (either in whole or in part) only the net number of shares of Common Stock determined according to a formula set forth in the Pre-funded Warrants. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event we do not have or maintain an effective registration statement, there are no circumstances that would require us to make any cash payments or net cash settle the Pre-funded Warrants to the holders.\n\n_Transferability_\n\nSubject to applicable laws, the Pre-funded Warrants may be offered for sale, sold, transferred or assigned at the option of the holder upon surrender of the Pre-funded Warrants to us together with the appropriate instruments of transfer.\n\n_Exchange Listing_\n\nThere is no established trading market for the Pre-funded Warrants and we do not plan on applying to list the Pre-funded Warrants on The Nasdaq Capital Market any other national securities exchange or any other nationally recognized trading system.\n\n_Fundamental Transactions_\n\nIf, at any time while the Pre-funded Warrants are outstanding, (1) we consolidate or merge with or into another corporation whether or not the Company is the surviving corporation, (2) we sell, lease, license, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, or any of our significant subsidiaries, (3) any purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by us or another individual or entity) is completed pursuant to which holders of our Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of our Common Stock, (4) we consummate a securities purchase agreement or other business combination with another person or entity whereby such other person or entity acquires more than 50% of our outstanding Common Stock, or (5) we effect any reclassification or recapitalization of our Common Stock or any compulsory exchange pursuant to which our Common Stock is converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, or each, a \"Fundamental Transaction,” then upon any subsequent exercise of pre-funded warrants, the holders thereof will have the right to receive the same amount and kind of securities, cash or property as they would have been entitled to receive upon the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction if they had been, immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction, the holder of the number of shares of Common Stock then issuable upon exercise of those pre-funded warrants, and any additional consideration payable as part of the Fundamental Transaction.\n\n77  \n---  \n  \n_Rights as a Stockholder_\n\nExcept by virtue of such holder’s ownership of shares of our Common Stock or as otherwise set forth in the Pre-Funded Warrants, the holder of a Pre-funded Warrant does not have the rights or privileges of a holder of our Common Stock, including any voting rights, until the holder exercises the Pre-funded Warrant.\n\n**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**\n\nWe are offering on a best efforts basis up to [*] shares of Common Stock or Pre-Funded Warrants, based on an assumed public offering price of $[*] per share (or $[*] Pre-funded Warrant), which represents the closing price of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC on [*], 2024, for gross proceeds of up to approximately $[*] before deduction of placement agent fees and offering expenses. There is no minimum amount of proceeds that is a condition to closing of this offering. The actual amount of gross proceeds, if any, in this offering could vary substantially from the maximum amount of securities being offered in this prospectus.\n\nPursuant to a placement agency agreement, dated as of [*], 2024, we have engaged Maxim Group LLC to act as our exclusive placement agent to solicit offers to purchase the securities offered by this prospectus. The placement agent is not purchasing or selling any securities, nor is it required to arrange for the purchase and sale of any specific number or dollar amount of securities, other than to use its \"best efforts” to arrange for the sale of the securities by us. Therefore, we may not sell the entire amount of securities being offered. Investors purchasing securities offered hereby will have the option to execute a securities purchase agreement with us. In addition to the rights and remedies available to all investors in this offering under federal and state securities laws, the investors which enter into a securities purchase agreement will also be able to bring claims of breach of contract against us.

There is no minimum number of Common Stock and Pre-funded Warrants to be sold or minimum aggregate offering proceeds for this offering to close.\n\nWe will deliver the securities being issued to the investors upon receipt of investor funds for the purchase of the securities offered pursuant to this prospectus. We expect to deliver the securities being offered pursuant to this prospectus on or about [*], 2024.\n\n**Placement Agent Fees, Commissions and Expenses**\n\nUpon the closing of this offering, we will pay the placement agent a cash transaction fee equal to 8.0% of the aggregate gross cash proceeds to us from the sale of the securities in the offering.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity(deficit), and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nExplanatory Paragraph- Going Concern\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022. The Company had a net loss of $7,370,465 and $2,877,357 and net cash used in operating activities of $6,978,788 and $1,683,292, respectively. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters to be communicated, are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\n\nWe did not identify any critical audit matters that need to be communicated.\n\n![](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001902794/000149315224039573/fin_002.jpg)\n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2023.\n\nCoral Springs, Florida\n\nJune 3, 2024, except for discontinued operations and Note 8, specifically the reverse stock split, as to which the date is August 13, 2024\n\n**ASSURANCE DIMENSIONS, LLC**\n\n**also d/b/a McNAMARA and ASSOCIATES, LLC**\n\n**TAMPA BAY:** 4920 W Cypress Street, Suite 102 **|** Tampa, FL 33607 **|** Office: 813.443.5048 **|** Fax: 813.443.5053\n\n**JACKSONVILLE:** 7800 Belfort Parkway, Suite 290 **|** Jacksonville, FL 32256 **|** Office: 888.410.2323 **|** Fax: 813.443.5053\n\n**ORLANDO:** 1800 Pembrook Drive, Suite 300 **|** Orlando, FL 32810 **|** Office: 888.410.2323 **|** Fax: 813.443.5053\n\n**SOUTH FLORIDA:** 3111 N.

(\"MGO,” \"MGO Global,” the \"Company,” \"we,” \"our” and \"us”) has built a brand acceleration platform with a focus on the acquisition, optimization and monetization of consumer brands across multiple categories. Our mission is to provide customers with unmatched variety, quality and shopping experience, while adding considerable value for MGO’s shareholders.\n\nOur accomplished leadership team encompasses decades of experience in building successful global lifestyle brands, including fashion design, marketing, technology, corporate finance and branding. We strive to continually push innovation and evolution of the consumer product cycle without compromising quality and design integrity. Through our end-to-end, scalable brand-building platform, backed by robust consumer behavioral data, we are engaged in nurturing digitally native brands that will thrive in the modern Direct to Consumer (\"DTC”) economy.\n\nWe operate our business through three subsidiaries: MGOTeam1, LLC (\"MGOTeam1”); Americana Liberty, LLC and MGO Digital LLC.\n\nOn July 18, 2024, the Company effected a reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock at a ratio of 1-for-10.\n\n**_The Messi Store/MGOTeam 1 LLC_**\n\nMGOTeam1 designs, manufactures, licenses, distributes, advertises and sells a range of products under the soccer legend Lionel (‘Leo”) Messi brand, _Messi Brand_. The _Messi Brand_ is a premium lifestyle brand with a sporty edge and sells their products under their website www.themessistore.com.\n\nOn October 29, 2018, the Company entered into a Trademark License Agreement with Leo Messi Management SL (\"LMM”). LMM granted the Company a worldwide non-exclusive license in order to use Leo Messi’s trademarks with the purpose of developing, manufacturing, trading and promoting The Messi Brand products.\n\nOn November 20, 2021, the Company entered into a new Trademark License Agreement with LMM to have the worldwide license to use Leo Messi’s trademarks for the purpose of developing, manufacturing, marketing, and promoting his products. The Company is to pay LMM a minimum guaranteed amount on account of royalties amounting to Four Million Euros (4,000,000 €) over the four-year agreement, net of taxes with the last payment due on November 15, 2024.\n\nOn March 21, 2024, MGO assigned the Messi License to Centric Brands, which paid the Company $2,000,000 in cash and assumed the obligation to pay the minimum guaranteed amount due to LMM in 2024. The Company accounted for The Messi Store segment as discontinued operations. _See Notes 2, 13 and 14._\n\n**_Stand Flagpoles/Americana Liberty, LLC_**\n\nOn March 13, 2023, we obtained a royalty-free, worldwide and exclusive license (the \"License”) to the use of certain assets of Stand Co., LLC (\"Stand”) for all purposes in exchange for payment of $1.00 by the Company. The license is in perpetuity. Licensed assets include all rights to all stock keeping units (\"SKU”) of Stand sold under the names: \"Roosevelt Premium 25 foot Telescoping Flag Pole Kit,” \"20 Foot Telescoping Flag Pole Kit” and \"LED Solar Flag Pole Light;” any intellectual property and other intangible property related to SKUs, including but not limited to all rights to a brand name \"Stand Flagpoles,” domain and website www.standflagpoles.com, the Meta pages associated with \"Stand Flagpoles” brand name (in Facebook and Instagram); all manufacturer, distributor and customer contracts and relationships for SKUs; marketing materials; any commercialization rights; domain and administrative access to Stand’s Shopify account, Facebook Assets & Accounts; all historical digital and non-digital assets; and customer database since inception.\n\nF-7  \n---  \n  \nIn support of our new flagpole business, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Americana Liberty, LLC (\"Americana Liberty”), on March 13, 2023, which was created to advertise and sell the licensed line of Stand Flagpoles and other related products, along with an expanding line of patriotic-themed products to be developed and marketed to consumers under our new Americana Liberty brand.\n\nIn addition, on May 11, 2023, we executed a 12-month consulting agreement with Jason Harward, the owner of Stand Co. and nephew of our former Chief Marketing Officer of the Company. The consultant shall furnish the Company with business continuity and consulting services, substantially similar to the following: providing general advice and counsel regarding establishment of systems and processes for direct-to-consumer (\"DTC”) and ecommerce sales and operations; provide subject matter and product-level expertise in the area of flag-poles, flags, and related products; provide consultation regarding product sourcing and distribution; and assist with the establishment, operation, optimization, and maintenance of DTC and ecommerce platforms on behalf of the Company. Consultant will be compensated for services through a combination of cash or immediately available funds and restricted stock units or shares of the Company’s stock as follows: (1) cash in the amount of $150,000, paid on September 30, 2023; (2) cash in the amount of $200,000, paid on January 10, 2024, upon satisfactory performance of the consultant’s obligations under the agreement; (3) 15,000 restricted stock units of the Company issuable on May 11, 2023 and subject to vesting in equal quarterly installments throughout the term of the agreement commencing on January 31, 2024. $109,679 was recorded as stock-based compensation for the fair value of the restricted stock units awarded as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**_MGO Digital LLC_**\n\nIn November 2022, we formed MGO Digital LLC to leverage data analytics, advanced technology-enabled marketing and our leadership team’s industry relationships and expertise to identify, incubate and test market new proprietary brands and brand concepts.\n\n**NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\nBasis of Presentation \n\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP”) and include all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s financial position for the periods presented.\n\nMGOTeam1 was formed on October 11, 2018, and the Company entered into a Rollover Agreement by and among MGOTeam1 and members of MGOTeam1 on December 6, 2021. All of the members of MGOTeam1, except for one member who owns a 11.82% membership interest in MGOTeam1, exchanged all of their membership interests in MGOTeam1 for 8,881,800 shares of the Company’s common stock. A sole MGOTeam1’s member did not rollover its 11.82% membership interest in MGOTeam1 to the Company as of December 6, 2021, and remains a member in MGOTeam1.\n\nF-8  \n---  \n  \nWe account for the 11.82% remaining minority interest in MGOTeam1 as non-controlling interest. Both the Company and MGOTeam1 were under common control, the series of contractual arrangements between the Company and MGOTeam1 in December 6, 2021 constituted a reorganization under common control and are required to be retrospectively applied to the consolidated financial statements at their historical amounts.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nReclassifications\n\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to reflect the impact of the discontinued operations treatment in order to conform to the current period presentation. In addition, on July 18, 2024, the Company effected a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-10. Accordingly, the financial statements presented in this Form 10-K/A have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split historically.\n\nEstimates\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our most critical estimates include those related to stock-based compensation, inventory and inventory allowance valuation. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company maintains its cash with high credit quality financial institutions; at times, such balances with any one financial institution may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC”) insured limit of $250,000. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $586,013 and $0 in excess of the federal insurance limit, respectively.\n\nAccounts Receivable\n\nAccounts receivables are carried at their estimated collectible amounts, net of any estimated allowances for credit losses. We grant unsecured credit to our wholesale customers which are deemed creditworthy. Ongoing credit evaluations are performed and potential credit losses estimated by management are charged to operations on a regular basis. At the time any particular account receivable is deemed uncollectible, the balance is charged to the allowance for credit losses. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had no allowance for credit losses.\n\nInventory\n\nInventory consists of raw materials and finished goods ready for sale and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We value inventories using the weighted average costing method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. We regularly review inventory and consider forecasts of future demand, market conditions and product obsolescence. If the estimated realized value of our inventory is less than cost, we make provisions in order to reduce its carrying value to its estimated net realizable value. The write downs are recognized as a component of cost of sales. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had no allowances for inventory obsolescence.\n\nF-9  \n---  \n  \nProperty and Equipment, Net\n\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures for renewals and improvements that significantly add to the productivity capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed. When equipment is retired or sold, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resultant gain or loss is reflected in income. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method, based on useful lives of the assets which is three years for computers, equipment and software. Depreciation expense from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, was $6,502 and $0, respectively. Accumulated depreciation from continuing operations as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $6,503 and $0, respectively.\n\nSCHEDULE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET USEFUL LIFE\n\nUseful Life | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---|---  \nComputer equipment and software | 3 years | $| 308,774 | $|  -  \nFurniture | 3 years | 17,191 | -  \nTotal property and equipment | 325,965  \nLess: Accumulated depreciation | (6,503| ) | -  \nProperty and equipment, net | $| 319,462 | $| -  \n  \nLeases\n\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception or modification of the arrangement. An arrangement is or contains a lease if there are identified assets and the right to control the use of an identified asset is conveyed for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control over the use of the identified asset means the lessee has both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and the right to direct the use of the asset. The Company executed a one-year office lease in February 2023. Due to the short-term nature of the lease, the Company did not account for the lease as a right of use asset. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, the Company renewed the office lease for an additional one-year term.\n\nAccounts Payable\n\nThe composition of accounts payable and accrued expenses from continuing operations are as follows:\n\nSCHEDULE OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES\n\nDecember 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \nAccounts payable | $| 184,677 | $| -  \nAccounts payable, related party | 5,678 | -  \nAccrued liabilities | 216,297 | 9,972  \nAccrued payroll | 533,643 | -  \nTotal accounts payable and accrued expenses | $| 940,295 | $| 9,972  \n  \nF-10  \n---  \n  \nWarrants\n\nThe Company accounts for a warrant as an equity instrument, liability or share-based compensation in accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, and/or ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation, depending on the specific terms of the agreement.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nStock-based compensation expense reflects the fair value of stock-based awards measured at the grant date and recognized over the requisite service period. The Company estimates the fair value of each stock-based option award on the measurement date using the Black-Scholes option valuation model which incorporates assumptions as to stock price volatility, the expected life of the options, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. For restricted stock awards, the Company records the value of the Company stock at the date of the grant as stock-based compensation expense.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nThe Company recognizes revenues when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which it expects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company recognizes revenues following the five step model prescribed under ASU No. 2014-09: (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation.\n\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of _Messi Brand_ and _Stand Flagpoles_ products comprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through direct wholesale or online sales through our websites _www.themessistore.com_ and _www.standflagpole.com_. We satisfy the performance obligation and record revenues when transfer of control to the customer has occurred, based on the terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product. Control is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Control transfers to online customers at the time upon receipt of the goods. The transactions price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 30 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of sale for direct wholesale and online transactions.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company generated revenues of $3,668,926 and $0, respectively, directly from consumers via our website.\n\nThe following table presents net revenue by geographic location which is recognized at a point in time:\n\nSCHEDULE OF NET REVENUE BY GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 | Total  \n---|---  \nUnited States | $| 3,667,176  \nRest of the World | 1,750  \nTotal Revenues | $| 3,668,926  \nYear Ended December 31, 2022 | **Total**  \n---|---  \nUnited States | $|  -  \nRest of the World | -  \nTotal Revenues | $| -  \n  \nF-11  \n---  \n  \nNon-Controlling Interest\n\nAs of December 6, 2021, one shareholder did not rollover its 11.82% membership interest from MGOTEAM LLC to MGOTEAM 1 LLC. According to ASC 810, _Consolidation_ , the carrying amount of the non-controlling interest (\"NCI”) will be adjusted to reflect the change in the NCI’s ownership interest in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the NCI is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized in additional paid in capital and attributed to the equity holders of the parent. The Company accounted for this portion of shares as non-controlling interest in net loss of $227,061 and $294,411 from the net loss for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nForeign currency\n\nThe Company’s functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. The resulting monetary assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the subsequent balance sheet date. Revenue and expense components are translated to U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates in effect during the period. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recognized in other income, net within the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nSegment Reporting\n\nOn March 21, 2024, the Company discontinued operations of The Messi Store due to the Deed executed with Centric, LMM and the Company. As such, the Company is no longer required to provide segment reporting, as the Company has only one reportable segment as of June 30, 2024.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, the Company generally considers all expected future events other than enactments of changes in the tax law. For deferred tax assets, management evaluates the probability of realizing the future benefits of such assets. The Company establishes valuation allowances if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon its ability to realize the deferred tax assets. Management has considered the Company’s history of cumulative net losses incurred and has concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of the deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established against the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022\n\nF-12  \n---  \n  \nThe Company recognizes the tax effects of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date and then only in an amount more likely than not to be sustained upon review by the tax authorities. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. The Company classifies potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as income tax expense. As of the year ended December 31, 2023 there was no income tax expense reported by the Company.\n\nNet Loss Per Share\n\nBasic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss available to ordinary shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted net loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential common shares had been issued if such additional common shares were dilutive. Since the Company had net losses for all the periods presented, basic and diluted loss per share are the same, and additional potential common shares have been excluded, as their effect would be anti-dilutive. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, total stock options of 114,000 and 0, respectively, and warrants of 15,198 and 70,000, respectively, were not included in the net loss per share calculation as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.\n\nFair Value Measurements\n\nThe Company has determined the fair value of certain assets and liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which provides a framework for measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques should maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nA fair value hierarchy has been established, which prioritizes the valuation inputs into three broad levels. Level 1 inputs consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the related asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs related to the asset or liability. \n\n**Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements**\n\nIn June 2016 and subsequently amended in March 2022, the FASB issued ASC 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurements of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\"ASC 326”), which replaces the existing incurred loss model with a current expected credit loss (\"CECL”) model that requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The Company would be required to use a forward-looking CECL model for accounts receivables, guarantees and other financial instruments. The Company adopted ASC 326 on January 1, 2023 and ASC 326 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07 – Segment Reporting (Topic ASC 280) Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The ASU improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosure about significant segment expenses. The enhancements under this update require disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM”) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, require disclosure of _other segment items_ by reportable segment and a description of the composition of _other segment items_ , require annual disclosures under ASC 280 to be provided in interim periods, clarify use of more than one measure of segment profit or loss by the CODM, require that the title of the CODM be disclosed with an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of segment profit or loss to make decisions, and require that entities with a single reportable segment provide all disclosures required by this update and required under ASC 280. ASU 2023-07 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect that this guidance will have a material impact upon our financial position and results of operations.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09 – Income Taxes (Topic ASC 740) Income Taxes. The ASU improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 will become effective beginning of our 2025 fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. We do not expect that this guidance will have a material impact upon our financial position and results of operations.\n\nF-13  \n---  \n  \n**NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN**\n\nIn the pursuit of MGO’s long-term growth strategy and the development of its growing portfolio of brands, the Company has incurred continued operating losses. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had a working capital surplus of $602,286. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred losses from continuing operations of $5,483,626 and $364,502 respectively, and cash used in continuing operating activities of $7,244,305 and $1,675,571, respectively. We believe the cash on hand, in connection with cash generated from future revenue, may not be sufficient to sustain continued operating losses.\n\nOn February 8, 2024, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (\"S-3”) to provide our Company with the flexibility to issue and sell securities if and when deemed appropriate to support our ongoing business operations and in the best interest of our shareholders. The S-3 contained two prospectuses: i) a base prospectus that covers the potential offering, issuance and sale from time to time of our common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities and units in one or more offerings with a total value of up to $100,000,000; and ii) a sales agreement prospectus covering the potential offering, issuance and sale from time to time of shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1,650,000 pursuant to an equity distribution agreement entered into with the New York-based investment banking firm, Maxim Group LLC (\"At-the-Market Offering” or \"ATM”). On June 7, 2024, MGO entered into an Amendment No. 1 (\"Amendment”) to the equity distribution agreement for the ATM whereby the offering size was amended to reflect an increase in the aggregate gross sales price from $1,650,000 to $3,389,384. As of June 30, 2024, we have received net proceeds from sales of our common stock pursuant to the ATM totaling an aggregate of $1,665,533. See Note 14 _._\n\nThe Company is continually evaluating strategies to obtain required additional funding to support our future operations. These strategies may include, but are not limited to, equity financing, issuing or restructuring debt, entering into other financing arrangements, and restructuring operations to increase revenues and decrease expenses. Any additional equity financing that we obtain may dilute the ownership held by our existing shareholders. The economic dilution to our shareholders will be significant if our stock price does not materially increase, or if the effective price of any sale is below the price paid by a particular shareholder. The Company may be unable to access further equity or debt financing when needed or obtain additional liquidity under acceptable terms, if at all. As such, these factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve (12) months from the date these financial statements are issued.\n\n**NOTE 4 – INVENTORY **\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, net inventories amounted to $607,022 and $0, respectively.\n\nSCHEDULE OF INVENTORY\n\nDecember 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \nFinished goods | $| 607,022 | $|  -  \nTotal | $| 607,022 | $| -  \n  \n**NOTE 5 – PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS**\n\nBALANCE SHEET ITEMS\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, prepaid expenses amounted to $185,925 and $0, respectively. \n\nSCHEDULE OF PREPAID EXPENSES\n\nDecember 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \nPrepaid expenses | $| 178,425 | $|  -  \nPrepaid rent | 7,500 | -  \nTotal | $| 185,925 | $| -  \n  \nF-14  \n---  \n  \n**NOTE 6 – LOAN PAYABLE**\n\nOn May 25, 2022, the Company entered into a loan with PayPal with an interest rate of 6.51%, principal balance of $25,000 and a monthly payment of $539 over the term of the loan.

See Note 14. $150,000 was paid in cash to the Consultant, $70,000 was accrued in selling, general, administrative expense and $109,679 related to stock-based compensation expense for the fair value of the 15,000 restricted stock units awarded per the consulting agreement were recorded as of December 31, 2023.\n\nF-15  \n---  \n  \n**NOTE 8 – STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY (DEFICIT)**\n\nSTOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n\n**_Common Stock_**\n\nOn January 12, 2023, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the \"Underwriting Agreement”) with Boustead Securities, LLC, as representative of the underwriters, relating to the Company’s initial public offering (the \"Offering”) of 172,000 shares (the \"Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (\"common stock”), which included the exercise by the underwriters in full of the over-allotment option to purchase an additional 22,500 shares of the Company’s common stock, at an Offering price of $50.00 per share. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, in exchange for the Representative’s firm commitment to purchase the Shares, the Company agreed to sell the Shares to the Representative at a purchase price of $46.50 (93% of the public offering price per Share of $50.00) and issue the underwriters three year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 8,625 shares of the Company’s common stock, which is equal to five percent (5%) of the Shares sold in the Offering. Such warrants have an exercise price of $62.50, which is equal to 125% of the Offering price (the \"Warrant”).\n\nThe Shares were offered and sold pursuant to the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-268484), as amended (the \"Registration Statement”), and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"Commission”) the final prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act”). The Registration Statement was declared effective by the Commission on January 12, 2023. The closing of the Offering for the Shares took place on January 18, 2023 with proceeds of $7,560,354, net of $1,064,646 of issuance costs, which included 22,500 shares sold by the Company upon the exercise by the underwriters of the over-allotment option in full. The Company used the net proceeds from the Offering for team expansion, marketing, general and administrative corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures.\n\nIn January 2023, the Company issued 70,000 shares to the Pre-IPO funding investors pursuant to the exercise of their warrants at fair value of $10.00 per share.\n\nIn January 2023, the Company issued 12,731 shares to Boustead Securities, LLC pursuant to the cashless exercise of their 16,448 warrants.\n\nOn January 13, 2023, in connection with the Offering, the Company commenced trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under ticker symbol \"MGOL.”\n\nIn November and December 2023, the Company issued 1,125 shares of common stock for consulting services at fair value of $5,281.\n\nIn November and December 2023, the Company issued 1,334 shares for the vested Restricted Stock Units issued to directors at fair value of $6,666.\n\nOn July 18, 2024, the Company effected a reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock at a ratio of 1-for-10.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had the following common stock transactions:\n\nThe Company issued 192,500 shares with proceeds of $1,712,564 from Pre-IPO funding, net of issuance costs of $212,436, 14,123 shares were issued to consultants for services at fair value of $141,731 and 3,000 shares were issued to a consultant for services at fair value of $30,000.

The 2022 Plan governs equity awards to our employees, directors, officers, consultants and other eligible participants. Initially, the maximum number of shares of our Common Stock that may be subject to awards under the 2022 Plan is 218,647. The maximum number of shares that are subject to awards under the 2022 Plan is subject to an annual increase equal to the lesser of (i) 50,000 shares of our Common Stock; (ii) a number of shares of our Common Stock equal to 4% of the prior year’s maximum number or (iii) such number of shares of our Common Stock as determined by the 2022 Plan administrator.\n\nOn April 12, 2024, the Board unanimously authorized and approved an amendment (\"Plan Amendment”) to MGO’s 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2022 Plan”) to increase the number of shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, (\"Common Stock”) reserved for issuance under the 2022 Plan by an additional 182,451 shares of Common Stock. Such an increase resulted in a total of 451,188 shares of Common Stock being reserved under the 2022 Plan, of which 205,071 will be available for future awards. On April 17, 2024 (the \"Record Date”), a majority of our stockholders consented to the Plan Amendment. In accordance with Rule 14c-2 of the Exchange Act, corporate actions described above will be effective no earlier than twenty (20) days after a Schedule 14C Information Statement has been mailed to our stockholders, which was mailed on April 29, 2024.\n\nThe types of awards permitted under the 2022 Plan include nonqualified stock options, qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units and other awards. Each option shall be exercisable at such times and subject to such terms and conditions as the Board may specify.\n\nEquity awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s ordinary shares at the date of grant; those options have ten-year contractual terms and vest according to the vesting plan as designated by management, generally between immediate vesting to three-year continued service term. Certain equity awards provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control, as defined in the plans.\n\nThe fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black Scholes option-pricing model. The Company uses historical option exercise and termination data to estimate the term the options are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

The Company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $10,059,777 for both U.S. federal and state tax purposes as of December 31, 2023 with no expiration date. Utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the \"ownership change” limitations provided by Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and other similar state provisions. Any annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization.\n\nThe Company has not recorded any income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022, due to the benefit of net operating losses in these periods. The reconciliation between the federal statutory income tax rate of 21% and the blended state income tax rate of 5.5% to the Company’s effective tax for the periods presented is as follows:\n\nSCHEDULE OF EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE\n\nAmount | Percent | Amount | Percent  \n---|---|---|---  \nYear Ended December 31,  \n2023 | 2022  \nAmount | Percent | Amount | Percent  \nFederal provision at statutory rate | $| (1,409,660| ) | 21.0| % | $| (604,245| ) | 21.0| %  \nState income taxes | (390,684| ) | 5.5| % | - | -  \nNon-deductible expenses | (116,921| ) | - | 21,226 | (0.7| )%  \nChange in valuation allowance | 1,917,265 | - | 583,019 | (20.3| )%  \nEffective tax rate | $| - | 0| % | $| - | 0.0| %  \n  \nThe Company’s effective tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance.\n\nThe Company periodically evaluates the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and adjusts the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets by the valuation allowance to the extent the future realization of the deferred tax assets is not judged to be more likely than not. The Company considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of its deferred tax assets, including its recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income or loss, the carryforward periods available to the Company for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors.\n\nFuture changes in the unrecognized tax benefit will have no impact on the effective tax rate due to the existence of the valuation allowance. The Company estimates that the unrecognized tax benefit will not change significantly within the next twelve months. The Company classifies income tax penalties and interest as part of general and administrative expense in its consolidated statements of operations. There were no interest or penalties accrued as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities generally for a period of three years from the later of each return due date or date filed.\n\n**NOTE 11 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**\n\nThe Company is subject to credit, liquidity and market risks, as well as other payment-related risks, such as risks associated with the fraudulent use of credit or debit cards and customer banking information, which could have adverse effects on our business and revenues due to chargebacks from customers.\n\nF-19  \n---  \n  \n**_Legal Proceedings_**\n\nWe are not currently involved in any litigation that we believe could have a materially adverse effect in our financial condition or results of operations. From time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings, asserted claims and investigations in the ordinary course of business, including commercial claims, employment and other matters, which management considers immaterial, individually and in the aggregate. The Company makes a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The requirement for these provisions is reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and costly. Protracted litigation and/or an unfavorable resolution of one or more of proceedings, claims or investigations against the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations.\n\n**NOTE 12 – SEGMENT INFORMATION**\n\n_Removed in its entirety due to the recast of discontinued operations of The Messi Store._\n\n**NOTE 13 – DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS**\n\nIn accordance with ASC 205-20 Presentation of Financial Statements: Discontinued Operations, a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported as discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major impact on an entity’s operations and financial results when the components of an entity meet the criteria in ASC paragraph 205-20-45-10. In the period in which the component meets the held for sale or discontinued operations criteria the major assets, other assets, current liabilities and non-current liabilities shall be reported as a component of total assets and liabilities separate from those balances of the continuing operations. At the same time, the results of all discontinued operations, less applicable income taxes (benefit), shall be reported as components of net income (loss) separate from the income (loss) of continuing operations.\n\nOn March 21, 2024, the Company, Centric and LMM signed a Deed of Novation, Assignment and Assumption (the \"Deed”) providing for MGOTeam1 to assign all of its rights and obligations under the existing Trademark License Agreement to Centric, and Centric has agreed to assume all of MGO’s rights and obligations in respect of the License Agreement, and the minimum guaranteed royalty amount due to LMM, with effect on and from March 21, 2024.\n\nAs a result of the Deed, the Company ceased operations of _The Messi Store_. The historical results of this business segment have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.\n\nSubsequent to the receipt of the $2,000,000 in proceeds from Centric, MGOTeam1 paid MGO Global, Inc. $2,000,000 for payment on a $2,658,635 Intercompany Demand Note.

The amendment became effective May 19th, 2024.\n\n**_Nasdaq Deficiency Notices and Request for Hearing_**\n\nOn April 17, 2024, the Company received a notice (the \"Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market (\"Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that 180 calendar day period that it had been provided by Nasdaq to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) on April 16, 2024 did not result in the Company regaining compliance. As a consequence, the Company is not eligible for a second 180 day period, because the Company does not meet the $5,000,000 minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for initial listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. In addition, the Notice informed the Company that in light of the foregoing and in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(A), the Nasdaq staff could no longer accept a plan for the Company to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) and this matter has become an additional and separate basis for delisting the Company’s securities from Nasdaq.\n\nThe Notice further stated unless the Company requests an appeal of the above determination by April 24, 2024, Nasdaq has determined that the Company’s securities will be scheduled for delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market and will be suspended at the opening of business on April 26, 2024, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the SEC, which will remove the Company’s securities from listing and registration on The Nasdaq Stock Market.\n\nOn April 18, 2024, the Company formally requested a hearing before Nasdaq’s Hearings Panel (the \"Panel”) and such request was granted by Nasdaq on April 19, 2024. The hearing date is scheduled for May 30, 2024.\n\nOn May 30, 2024, senior members of MGO’s executive team and the Company’s SEC counsel participated in the hearing before the Nasdaq’s Hearings Panel and endeavored to address all questions and concerns posed by the panelists relating to the Company’s plan to regain compliance with the continued listing standards (the \"Plan”) – the Plan was formally submitted to the members of the Nasdaq Hearings Panel on May 8, 2024. In accordance with the Plan, MGO requested at least until August 15, 2024 to evidence compliance with the Equity Rule and Bid Price Rule for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market through execution of the Plan.\n\nOn June 14, 2024, MGO received notice from Nasdaq confirming that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the \"Panel”) has determined to grant the request of MGO to continue its listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market subject to the following:\n\n1. On or before July 15, 2024, the Company will effect a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-10. _See Note 1 and 11_.\n\n2. On or before August 15, 2024, the Company will (a) complete the transactions described to the Panel to achieve compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (or its alternatives) and (b) demonstrate compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) by evidencing a closing bid price of $1.00 or more per share for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive trading sessions;\n\n3. On or before August 21, 2024, the Company must file a Form 8-K describing these transactions and indicating its post-transaction equity. The Company may do so with a balance sheet no older than 60 days containing pro forma adjustments for significant transactions or events occurring on or before the report date. Alternatively, the Company can provide an affirmative statement that, as of the date of the report, it believes it has regained compliance with the stockholders’ equity requirement based upon the specific transactions or events described; and\n\n4. At the time of filing the Form 8-K, the Company must demonstrate compliance with all other applicable requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company filed an 8-K on August 12, 2024, stating its compliance with the minimum equity requirement on August 9, 2024.\n\n**_Business Combination Agreement with Heidmar, Inc._**\n\nOn June 18, 2024, MGO entered into a definitive Business Combination Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Business Combination Agreement”) with Heidmar, Inc., (\"HMI”), a company organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands; Heidmar Maritime Holdings Corp., a company organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (\"Holdings”); HMR Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings (\"Merger Sub”); and Rhea Marine Ltd. and Maistros Shipinvest Corp (the \"HMI Shareholders”). The Company, Merger Sub, Holdings, HMI and HMI Shareholders are sometimes referred to herein individually as a \"Party” and, collectively, as the \"Parties.”\n\nPursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, the Parties will effect a business combination involving the following transactions (collectively, the \"Business Combination”):\n\n(a) | Merger Sub will merge (the \"Merger”) with and into the MGO, with MGO continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings;  \n---|---  \n(b) | all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of MGO (the \"MGO Common Stock”) prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into the right to receive common shares of Holdings (the \"Holdings Common Shares”) on a one-for-one basis;  \n(c) | immediately after the effective time of the Merger, the HMI Shareholders will transfer all the outstanding shares of common stock of HMI (the \"HMI Shares”) to Holdings (the \"HMI Share Acquisition”), with HMI becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings; and  \n(d) | Holdings shall issue to the HMI Shareholders (i) at the closing of the Business Combination (the \"Closing”), a number of Holdings Common Shares equal to (x) the number of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted and as-converted basis immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, times (y) 16.6667, divided by (z) the number of outstanding HMI Shares immediately prior to the HMI Share Acquisition and (ii) after the Closing and upon the satisfaction of certain earnout conditions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement, additional Holdings Common Shares equal to 10% of the shares issued to the Heidmar Shareholders on the Closing.  \n  \nMGO expects that the holders of MGO Common Stock and the Heidmar Shareholders will hold 5.66% and 94.34% (inclusive of shares to be distributed to advisors), respectively, of the Holdings Common Shares after the Closing, which is expected to occur late in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nF-22  \n---  \n  \n**MGO GLOBAL INC.**\n\n**CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS**\n\n**As of** **June 30, 2024 (Unaudited)** | **As of** **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---  \nAssets  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents | $| 1,301,585 | $| 836,446  \nAccounts receivable | 60,869 | 25,352  \nInventories | 844,719 | 607,022  \nPrepaid expenses | 314,567 | 178,425  \nOther current assets | 7,500 | 7,500  \nCurrent assets from discontinued operations | 8,851 | 267,703  \nTotal current assets | 2,538,091 | 1,922,448  \nProperty and equipment, net | 265,590 | 319,462  \nTotal assets | 2,803,681 | 2,241,910  \nLiabilities and stockholders’ equity  \nCurrent liabilities:  \nAccounts payable | 314,304 | 281,861  \nAccounts payable -

We strive to continually push innovation and evolution of the consumer product cycle without compromising quality and design integrity. Through our end-to-end, scalable brand-building platform, backed by robust consumer behavioral data, we are engaged in nurturing digitally native brands that will thrive in the modern Direct to Consumer (\"DTC”) economy.\n\nWe operate our business through three subsidiaries: Americana Liberty, LLC; MGO Digital LLC and MGOTeam1, LLC (\"MGOTeam1”).\n\nOn July 18, 2024, the Company effected a reverse stock split on the Company’s common stock at a ratio of 1-for-10.\n\n**_Stand Flagpoles/Americana Liberty, LLC_**\n\nOn March 13, 2023, we obtained a royalty-free, worldwide and exclusive license (the \"License”) to the use of certain assets of Stand Co., LLC (\"Stand”) for all purposes in exchange for payment of $1.00 by the Company. The license is in perpetuity. Licensed assets include all rights to all stock keeping units (\"SKU”) of Stand sold under the names: \"Roosevelt Premium 25 foot Telescoping Flag Pole Kit,” \"20 Foot Telescoping Flag Pole Kit” and \"LED Solar Flag Pole Light;” any intellectual property and other intangible property related to SKUs, including but not limited to all rights to the brand name _Stand Flagpoles_ , domain and website www.standflagpoles.com, the Meta pages associated with _Stand Flagpoles_ brand name (in Facebook and Instagram); all manufacturer, distributor and customer contracts and relationships for SKUs; marketing materials; any commercialization rights; domain and administrative access to Stand’s Shopify account, Facebook Assets & Accounts; all historical digital and non-digital assets; and customer database since inception.\n\nIn support of our flagpole business, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Americana Liberty, LLC (\"Americana Liberty”), on March 13, 2023, which was created to advertise and sell the licensed line of _Stand Flagpoles_ and other related products, along with an expanding line of patriotic-themed products to be developed and marketed to consumers under our new _Americana Liberty_ brand.\n\nIn addition, on May 11, 2023, we executed a 12-month consulting agreement with Jason Harward, the owner of Stand Co. and nephew of our former Chief Marketing Officer of the Company. The consultant shall furnish the Company with business continuity and consulting services, substantially similar to the following: provide general advice and counsel regarding the establishment of systems and processes for direct-to-consumer (\"DTC”) and e-commerce sales and operations; provide subject matter and product-level expertise in the area of flag-poles, flags, and related products; provide consultation regarding product sourcing and distribution; and assist with the establishment, operation, optimization, and maintenance of DTC and e-commerce platforms on behalf of the Company. Consultant was compensated for services through a combination of cash or immediately available funds and restricted stock units or shares of the Company’s stock as follows: (1) cash in the amount of $150,000, paid on September 30, 2023; (2) cash in the amount of $200,000, paid on January 10, 2024, upon satisfactory performance of the consultant’s obligations under the agreement; and (3) 15,000 restricted stock units of the Company issuable on May 11, 2023. $51,587 and $109,679 were recorded as stock-based compensation expense for the fair value of the restricted stock units awarded as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The consulting agreement ended May 2024.\n\nF-27  \n---  \n  \n**_MGO Digital LLC_**\n\nIn November 2022, we formed MGO Digital LLC to leverage data analytics, advanced technology-enabled marketing and our leadership team’s industry relationships and expertise to identify, incubate and test market new proprietary brands and brand concepts.\n\n**_The Messi Store/MGOTeam 1 LLC_**\n\nMGOTeam1 designed, manufactured, licensed, distributed, advertised and sold a range of products under the soccer legend Lionel (\"Leo”) Messi brand, _Messi Brand_. The _Messi Brand_ is a premium lifestyle brand with a sporty edge and sold its products direct to consumers through the website www.themessistore.com.\n\nIn October 2018, the Company entered into a Trademark License Agreement with Leo Messi Management SL (\"LMM”). LMM granted the Company a worldwide non-exclusive license in order to use Leo Messi’s trademarks with the purpose of developing, manufacturing, trading and promoting the _Messi Brand_ products.\n\nOn November 20, 2021, the Company entered into a new Trademark License Agreement (\"Messi License”) with LMM to have the worldwide license to use Leo Messi’s trademarks for the purpose of developing, manufacturing, marketing and promoting his products. The Company is to pay LMM a minimum guaranteed amount on account of royalties amounting to Four Million Euros (€4,000,000) over the four-year agreement, net of taxes with the last payment due on November 15, 2024.\n\nOn March 21, 2024, MGOTeam1 assigned the Messi License to Centric Brands, LLC (\"Centric”), which paid MGOTeam1 $2,000,000 in cash and assumed the obligation to pay the minimum guaranteed amount due to LMM in 2024. The Company accounted for _The Messi Store_ segment as discontinued operations. _See Note 10._\n\n**_Business Combination Agreement with Heidmar, Inc._**\n\nOn June 18, 2024, MGO entered into a definitive Business Combination Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Business Combination Agreement”) with Heidmar, Inc., (\"HMI”), a company organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands; Heidmar Maritime Holdings Corp., a company organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (\"Holdings”); HMR Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings (\"Merger Sub”); and Rhea Marine Ltd. and Maistros Shipinvest Corp (the \"HMI Shareholders”). The Company, Merger Sub, Holdings, HMI and HMI Shareholders are sometimes referred to herein individually as a \"Party” and, collectively, as the \"Parties.”\n\nPursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, the Parties will effect a business combination involving the following transactions (collectively, the \"Business Combination”):\n\n(a) | Merger Sub will merge (the \"Merger”) with and into the MGO, with MGO continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings;  \n---|---  \n(b) | all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of MGO (the \"MGO Common Stock”) prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into the right to receive common shares of Holdings (the \"Holdings Common Shares”) on a one-for-one basis;  \n(c) | immediately after the effective time of the Merger, the HMI Shareholders will transfer all the outstanding shares of common stock of HMI (the \"HMI Shares”) to Holdings (the \"HMI Share Acquisition”), with HMI becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings; and  \n(d) | Holdings shall issue to the HMI Shareholders (i) at the closing of the Business Combination (the \"Closing”), a number of Holdings Common Shares equal to (x) the number of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted and as-converted basis immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, times (y) 16.6667, divided by (z) the number of outstanding HMI Shares immediately prior to the HMI Share Acquisition and (ii) after the Closing and upon the satisfaction of certain earnout conditions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement, additional Holdings Common Shares equal to 10% of the shares issued to the Heidmar Shareholders on the Closing.  \n  \nF-28  \n---  \n  \nMGO expects that the holders of MGO Common Stock and the Heidmar Shareholders will hold 5.66% and 94.34% (inclusive of shares to be distributed to advisors), respectively, of the Holdings Common Shares after the Closing, which is expected to occur late in the fourth quarter of 2024. \n\n**NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\n**_Basis of Presentation_**\n\nThese unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP”) and include all normal reoccurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s financial position for the periods presented.\n\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and Form 10-K/A filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2024 and June 3, 2024, respectively. Interim results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.\n\nMGOTeam1 was formed on October 11, 2018, and the Company entered into a Rollover Agreement by and among MGOTeam1 and members of MGOTeam1 on December 6, 2021. All of the members of MGOTeam1, except for one member who owns a 11.82% membership interest in MGOTeam1, exchanged all of their membership interests in MGOTeam1 for 881,800 shares of the Company’s common stock. A sole MGOTeam1 member did not rollover its 11.82% membership interest in MGOTeam1 to the Company as of December 6, 2021, and remains a member in MGOTeam1.\n\nWe account for the 11.82% minority interest in MGOTeam1 as non-controlling interest. Both the Company and MGOTeam1 were under common control, the series of contractual arrangements between the Company and MGOTeam1 on December 6, 2021 constituted a reorganization under common control and are required to be retrospectively applied to the consolidated financial statements at their historical amounts.\n\n**_Principles of Consolidation_**\n\nThe unaudited consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n**_Reclassifications_**\n\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to reflect the impact of the discontinued operations treatment in order to conform to the current period presentation. In addition, on July 18, 2024, the Company effected a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-10. Accordingly, the financial statements presented in this Form 10-Q have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split historically.\n\nF-29  \n---  \n  \n**_Discontinued Operations_**\n\nOn March 20, 2024, MGOTeam1 entered into a term sheet with Centric, providing for the terms and conditions for MGOTeam1 to assign and Centric to assume the existing Trademark License Agreement (\"License Agreement”), dated November 21, 2021, with an expiration date of December 31, 2024 (\"Expiration Date”), between Leo Messi Management SL (\"LMM”) and MGOTeam1. Pursuant to the term sheet, Centric assumed the Company’s minimum guarantee obligation to LMM under the License Agreement for payment due dates in 2024 amounting to €1,500,000. MGO received full payment of the $2,000,000 consideration on March 22, 2024.\n\nOn March 21, 2024, the Company, Centric and LMM signed a Deed of Novation, Assignment and Assumption (the \"Deed”) providing for MGOTeam1 to assign all of its rights and obligations under the License Agreement to Centric, and Centric has agreed to assume all of MGO’s rights and obligations in respect of the License Agreement with effect on and from March 21, 2024. No other assets or liabilities were assumed. _See Note 10_\n\n**_Use of Estimates_**\n\nThe preparation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our most critical estimates include those related to stock-based compensation, inventory and inventory allowance valuation. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n**_Cash and Cash Equivalents_**\n\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company maintains its cash with high credit quality financial institutions; at times, such balances with any one financial institution may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC”) insured limits. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $870,992 and $586,446 in excess of the FDIC limit for cash from continuing operations, respectively.\n\n**_Accounts Receivable_**\n\nAccounts receivables are carried at their estimated collectible amounts, net of any estimated allowances for credit losses. We grant unsecured credit to our wholesale customers who are deemed creditworthy. Ongoing credit evaluations are performed, and potential credit losses estimated by management are charged to operations on a regular basis. At the time any particular account receivable is deemed uncollectible, the balance is charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no allowance for credit losses from continuing operations.\n\n**_Inventory_**\n\nInventory consists of raw materials and finished goods ready for sale and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We value inventories using the weighted average costing method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. We regularly review inventory and consider forecasts of future demand, market conditions and product obsolescence. If the estimated realized value of our inventory is less than cost, we make provisions in order to reduce its carrying value to its estimated net realizable value. The write downs are recognized as a component of cost of sales. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no reserve for inventory obsolescence impairment from continuing operations.\n\nF-30  \n---  \n  \n**_Property and Equipment, Net_**\n\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures for renewals and improvements that significantly add to the productivity capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed. When equipment is retired or sold, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resultant gain or loss is reflected in income. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method, based on useful lives of the assets which is three years for computers, equipment and software. Depreciation expense from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was $54,384 and $21,817, respectively.\n\nSCHEDULE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET USEFUL LIFE\n\nClassification | Useful Life | June 30, 2024 (unaudited) | December 31, 2023  \n---|---|---|---  \nComputer equipment and software | 3 years | $| 309,286 | $| 308,774  \nFurniture | 3 years | 17,191 | 17,191  \nProperty and equipment, gross | 325,965  \nLess: Accumulated depreciation | (60,887| ) | (6,503| )  \nProperty and equipment, net | $| 265,590 | $| 319,462  \n  \n**_Revenue Recognition_**\n\nThe Company recognizes revenues when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which it expects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company recognizes revenues following the five step model prescribed under ASU No. 2014-09: (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation.\n\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of _Stand Flagpoles_ products comprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through direct wholesale or online sales through our website _www.standflagpoles.com_. We satisfy the performance obligation and record revenues when transfer of control to the customer has occurred, based on the terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product. Control is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Control transfers to online customers at the time upon receipt of the goods. The transactions price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 30 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of sale for direct wholesale and online transactions.\n\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company generated revenues of $1,425,589 and $2,095,853 and $1,724,293 and $1,769,440, respectively, directly from consumers via our website. The Company does not have any major customers as revenue is primarily direct to individual consumers. All revenues for June 30, 2024 and 2023 were generated by customers within the United States. There were no sales to customers outside of the United States during either reporting period.\n\n_Non-Controlling Interest_\n\nAs of December 6, 2021, one shareholder did not rollover its 11.82% membership interest in MGOTeam1. According to ASC 810, _Consolidation_ , the carrying amount of the non-controlling interest (\"NCI”) will be adjusted to reflect the change in the NCI’s ownership interest in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the NCI is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized in additional paid in capital and attributed to the equity holders of the parent. The Company accounted for this portion of shares as non-controlling interest in net loss of $3,963 and $60,687 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; and net income of $223,844 and a net loss of $122,756 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nF-31  \n---  \n  \n_Foreign Currency_\n\nThe Company’s functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. The resulting monetary assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the subsequent balance sheet date. Revenue and expense components are translated to U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates in effect during the period. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recognized in other income, net within the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n_Segment Reporting_\n\nOn March 21, 2024, the Company discontinued operations of _The Messi Store_ due to the Deed executed with Centric, LMM and the Company. As such, the Company is no longer required to provide segment reporting, as the Company has only one reportable segment as of June 30, 2024.\n\n_Income Taxes_\n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, the Company generally considers all expected future events other than enactments of changes in the tax law. For deferred tax assets, management evaluates the probability of realizing the future benefits of such assets. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets when evidence suggests it is unlikely that the assets will be fully realized.\n\nThe Company recognizes the tax effects of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date and then only in an amount more likely than not to be sustained upon review by the tax authorities. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold is recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold is derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. The Company classifies potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as income tax expense.\n\n_Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements_\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07 – Segment Reporting (Topic ASC 280) Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The ASU improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosure about significant segment expenses. The enhancements under this update require disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM”) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, require disclosure of _other segment items_ by reportable segment and a description of the composition of _other segment items_ , require annual disclosures under ASC 280 to be provided in interim periods, clarify use of more than one measure of segment profit or loss by the CODM, require that the title of the CODM be disclosed with an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of segment profit or loss to make decisions, and require that entities with a single reportable segment provide all disclosures required by this update and required under ASC 280. ASU 2023-07 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASC 280 on January 1, 2024 and ASC 280 does not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n_Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted_\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09 – Income Taxes (Topic ASC 740) Income Taxes. The ASU improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 will become effective at the beginning of our 2025 fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. We do not expect that this guidance will have a material impact upon our financial position and results of operations.\n\nF-32  \n---  \n  \n**NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN**\n\nIn the pursuit of MGO’s long-term growth strategy and the development of its growing portfolio of brands, the Company has incurred continued operating losses. As of June 30, 2024, we had working capital of $1,700,344. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred losses from continuing operations of $4,306,223 and $1,564,839, respectively, and cash used in operating activities of $3,223,920 and $4,026,327, respectively. We believe the cash on hand, in connection with cash generated from future revenue, may not be sufficient to sustain continued operating losses. These factors cause substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date these financial statements were made available.\n\nOn February 8, 2024, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (\"S-3”) to provide our Company with the flexibility to issue and sell securities if and when deemed appropriate to support our ongoing business operations and in the best interest of our shareholders. The S-3 contained two prospectuses: i) a base prospectus that covers the potential offering, issuance and sale from time to time of our common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities and units in one or more offerings with a total value of up to $100,000,000; and ii) a sales agreement prospectus covering the potential offering, issuance and sale from time to time of shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1,650,000 pursuant to an equity distribution agreement entered into with the New York-based investment banking firm, Maxim Group LLC (\"At-the-Market Offering” or \"ATM”). On June 7, 2024, MGO entered into an Amendment No. 1 (\"Amendment”) to the equity distribution agreement for the ATM whereby the offering size was amended to reflect an increase in the aggregate gross sales price from $1,650,000 to $3,389,384. As of June 30, 2024, we received net proceeds from sales of our common stock pursuant to the ATM totaling an aggregate of $1,665,533.\n\n**NOTE 4 – BALANCE SHEET ITEMS**\n\n**_Inventory_**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, inventory amounted to $844,719 and $607,022, respectively.\n\n**_Prepaid Expenses_**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, prepaid expenses amounted to $314,567 and $178,425, respectively.\n\nSCHEDULE OF PREPAID EXPENSES\n\n**June 30, 2024** **(unaudited)** | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nPrepaid expenses | $| 58,693 | $| 5,577  \nPrepaid rent | 7,500 | 7,500  \nPrepaid inventories | 248,374 | 165,348  \nTotal | $| 314,567 | $| 178,425  \n  \nF-33  \n---  \n  \n**_Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities (Including Related Parties)_**\n\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities were $666,093 and $940,295 as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Accounts payable are mainly payables to vendors and accrued liabilities consist of mainly credit card payable and sales tax payable.\n\nSCHEDULE OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES\n\n**June 30, 2024** **(unaudited)** | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nAccounts payable | $| 314,304 | $| 281,861  \nAccounts payable, related party | 5,678 | 50,881  \nAccounts payable | 5,678 | 50,881  \nAccrued liabilities | 254,632 | 240,324  \nAccrued payroll | 91,479 | 367,230  \nTotal | $| 666,093 | $| 940,296  \n  \n**_Commitments and Contingencies_**\n\nIn January 2024, the Company entered into a financing agreement for the Company’s Directors and Officers insurance policy with First Insurance Funding at an interest rate of 7.58%, a principal balance of $225,185 and a monthly payment of $23,308 over the nine-month term of the promissory note. The policy term is January 2024 through December 2024. The loan will mature on October 12, 2024. \n\n**_Nasdaq Deficiency Notices, Hearings Panel Determinations and Reverse Stock Split_**\n\nOn April 17, 2024, the Company received a notice (the \"Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market (\"Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that 180 calendar day period that it had been provided by Nasdaq to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) on April 16, 2024 did not result in the Company regaining compliance. As a consequence, the Company is not eligible for a second 180 day period, because the Company does not meet the $5,000,000 minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for initial listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. In addition, the Notice informed the Company that in light of the foregoing and in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(A), the Nasdaq staff could no longer accept a plan for the Company to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) and this matter has become an additional and separate basis for delisting the Company’s securities from Nasdaq.\n\nThe Notice further stated unless the Company requests an appeal of the above determination by April 24, 2024, Nasdaq has determined that the Company’s securities will be scheduled for delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market and will be suspended at the opening of business on April 26, 2024, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the SEC, which will remove the Company’s securities from listing and registration on The Nasdaq Stock Market.\n\nOn April 18, 2024, the Company formally requested a hearing before Nasdaq’s Hearings Panel (the \"Panel”) and such request was granted by Nasdaq on April 19, 2024. The hearing date is scheduled for May 30, 2024.\n\nOn May 30, 2024, senior members of MGO’s executive team and the Company’s SEC counsel participated in the hearing before the Nasdaq’s Hearings Panel and endeavored to address all questions and concerns posed by the panelists relating to the Company’s plan to regain compliance with the continued listing standards (the \"Plan”) – the Plan was formally submitted to the members of the Nasdaq Hearings Panel on May 8, 2024. In accordance with the Plan, MGO requested at least until August 15, 2024 to evidence compliance with the Equity Rule and Bid Price Rule for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market through execution of the Plan. \n\nOn June 14, 2024, MGO received notice from Nasdaq confirming that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the \"Panel”) has determined to grant the request of MGO to continue its listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market subject to the following:\n\n1. On or before July 15, 2024, the Company will effect a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-10. _See Note 1 and 11_.\n\n2. On or before August 15, 2024, the Company will (a) complete the transactions described to the Panel to achieve compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (or its alternatives) and (b) demonstrate compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) by evidencing a closing bid price of $1.00 or more per share for a minimum of ten (10) consecutive trading sessions;\n\nF-34  \n---  \n  \n3. On or before August 21, 2024, the Company must file a Form 8-K describing these transactions and indicating its post-transaction equity. The Company may do so with a balance sheet no older than 60 days containing pro forma adjustments for significant transactions or events occurring on or before the report date. Alternatively, the Company can provide an affirmative statement that, as of the date of the report, it believes it has regained compliance with the stockholders’ equity requirement based upon the specific transactions or events described; and\n\n4. At the time of filing the Form 8-K, the Company must demonstrate compliance with all other applicable requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. _See Note 11_.\n\nThe Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K on August 12, 2024, stating that the Company believes that it is in compliance with the Nasdaq minimum stockholders’ equity requirement as of August 9, 2024. \n\n**NOTE 5 – LOAN PAYABLE**\n\nOn January 24, 2024, MGO entered into a 52-week loan with PayPal for $85,000 and a $10,312 fixed loan fee, aggregating $95,312. Weekly payments are $1,833 over the life of the loan. The outstanding balance of this loan was $49,038 as of June 30, 2024.\n\nSCHEDULE OF LOAN PAYABLE\n\nJune 30, 2024 (unaudited) | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nCurrent portion of loans payable | $| 49,038 | $| -  \nTotal notes payable | $| 49,038 | $| -  \n  \n**NOTE 6 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**\n\nThe accounts payable owed to our related parties as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $5,678 and $50,881, respectively, and was comprised of employee reimbursements for June 30, 2024 and expense reports, contractor payments and board fees for December 31, 2023.\n\nThe accrued payroll owed to our executives and staff as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $91,479 and $367,230, respectively, inclusive of bonuses.\n\nOn May 11, 2023, we executed a 12-month consulting agreement with Jason Harward (\"Consultant”), the owner of Stand and nephew of Matt Harward, MGO’s former Chief Marketing Officer. The consulting agreement compensation terms were $350,000 payable in two installments, the first installment was paid in September 2023 and second installment was paid in January 2024. The compensation terms included 15,000 restricted stock units awarded on January 31, 2024 which vest over the remaining life of the consulting agreement. The Company recognized $51,587 of stock-based compensation for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and $123,914 for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nOn April 2, 2024, the Board of Directors (the \"Board”) of MGO, at the recommendation of the Compensation Committee (the \"Committee”), approved an increase in the base salary of Ms. Dana Perez, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, from $165,000 to $200,000 per annum. This salary increase is effective as of April 2, 2024. In addition, the Board approved an increase in the annual cash bonus which Ms. Perez will be entitled to receive based on her and the Company’s continued satisfaction of a combination of personal and Company’s goals. The annual cash bonus has been increased from ‘up to 20%’ to ‘up to 25%’ of Ms. Perez’s base salary. The Board also approved the immediate granting of 5,000 restricted stock units (\"RSUs”) in accordance with the MGO 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"Plan”). Subject to any acceleration provisions contained in the Plan or any other written agreement authorized by the Committee governing the terms of this award, these RSUs will vest on the one-year anniversary of their grant date, or April 2, 2025.\n\nF-35  \n---  \n  \n**NOTE 7 – STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY**\n\n**_Common Stock_**\n\nOn January 12, 2023, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the \"Underwriting Agreement”) with Boustead Securities, LLC, as representative of the underwriters, relating to the Company’s initial public offering (the \"Offering”) of 172,500 shares (the \"Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (\"common stock”), which included the exercise by the underwriters in full of the over-allotment option to purchase an additional 22,500 shares of the Company’s common stock at an Offering price of $50.00 per share. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, in exchange for the Representative’s firm commitment to purchase the Shares, the Company agreed to sell the Shares to the Representative at a purchase price of $46.50 (93% of the public offering price per Share of $50.00) and issue the underwriters three-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 8,625 shares of the Company’s common stock, which is equal to five percent (5%) of the Shares sold in the Offering.

Our charter provides that no director of the Company shall be personally liable to it or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director, notwithstanding any provision of law imposing such liability, except to the extent that the DGCL prohibits the elimination or limitation of liability of directors for breaches of fiduciary duty.\n\nSection 145 of the DGCL provides that a Company has the power to indemnify a director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company, or a person serving at the request of the Company for another Company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise in related capacities against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with an action, suit or proceeding to which he was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, ending or completed action, suit or proceeding by reason of such position, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, in any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, except that, in the case of actions brought by or in the right of the Company, no indemnification shall be made with respect to any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Company unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or other adjudicating court determines that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all of the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.\n\nOur charter and bylaws provide for the indemnification, to the fullest extent permitted from time to time by the DGCL or any other applicable laws as presently or hereafter in effect, any person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Company or, while a director or officer of the Company, is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and reasonably incurred by such person.\n\nII-1  \n---  \n  \nOur bylaws provide that if an indemnification claim made by an officer or director of the Company is not paid in full by the Company within thirty (30) days after a written claim has been received by the Company, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Company to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where any required undertaking has been tendered to the Company) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the DGCL for the Company to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Company. Neither the failure of the Company (including its board of directors (\"Board”), legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Company (including its Board, legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.\n\nThe right of our directors and officers to indemnification under our charter and bylaws is not exclusive of any other right which they may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, our charter, our bylaws, any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.\n\nThe Company may also maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL or under the provisions of our bylaws.\n\nIn any underwriting agreement we enter into in connection with the sale of Common Stock being registered hereby, the underwriters will agree to indemnify, under certain conditions, us, our directors, our officers and persons who control us within the meaning of the Securities Act, against certain liabilities.\n\n**ITEM 15.** | **RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES**  \n---|---  \n  \nSince the Company’s incorporation on November 30,

registration statement:\n\n(i) To include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act;\n\n(ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than a 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the \"Calculation of Registration Fee” table in the effective registration statement; and\n\n(iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement; provided, however, that paragraphs (1)(i), (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above do not apply if the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission by the registrant pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are incorporated by reference in the registration statement, or is contained in a form of prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) that is part of the registration statement.\n\n(2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\n\n(3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.\n\n(4) That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act to any purchaser:\n\n(A) Each prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) shall be deemed to be part of the registration statement as of the date the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration statement; and\n\n(B) Each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.\n\n(5) That for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act to any purchaser in the initial distribution of securities, the undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:\n\n(i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;\n\nII-8  \n---  \n  \n(ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;\n\n(iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and\n\n(iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.\n\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to any charter provision, by law or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.\n\nThe undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that:\n\n(1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.\n\n(2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.\n\nII-9  \n---  \n  \n**SIGNATURES**\n\nPursuant to the

Rule 457(o) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).  \n---|---  \n(2) | Pursuant to Rule 416 under the Securities Act, this registration statement shall also cover any additional shares of the registrant’s securities that become issuable by reason of any share splits, share dividends or similar transactions.  \n(3) | No separate registration fee is payable pursuant to Rule 457(g) under the Securities Act.  \n(4) | The registrant may issue pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock in the offering. The purchase price of each pre-funded warrant will be equal to the price per share at which shares are being sold to the public in this offering, minus $0.00001, which constitutes the pre-funded portion of the exercise price of the pre-funded warrants, and the remaining unpaid exercise price of the pre-funded warrants will equal $0.00001 per share (subject to adjustment as provided for therein). The proposed maximum aggregate offering price of the shares will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis based on the offering price of any pre-funded warrants issued in the offering, and the proposed maximum aggregate offering price of the shares to be issued in the offering will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis based on the offering price of any pre-funded warrants issued in the offering. Accordingly, the proposed maximum aggregate offering price of the shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants is $3,000,000.  \n  \n**Exhibit 23.1**\n\nCONSENT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS\n\nWe hereby consent to the incorporation in this Registration Statement on Form S-1 of MGO Global, Inc. and Subsidiaries. of our report dated June 3, 2024, except for discontinued operations and Note 8, specifically the reverse stock split, as to which the date is August 13, 2024, relating to our audits of the consolidated financial statements, which appears herein, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nWe also consent to the reference to our firm under the caption “Experts” in the Prospectus, which is part of this Registration Statement.\n\n_/s/ Assurance Dimensions, Inc._  \n---  \nAssurance Dimensions  \nCoral Springs, Florida  \nOctober 4, 2024\n"

Statements made in this report that are not statements of historical fact, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements and should be evaluated as such. Investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management and involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions, which are subject to change at any time at our discretion. Forward-looking statements include information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business plan and strategies. Forward-looking statements include our assessment, from time to time of our competitive position, the industry environment, potential growth opportunities, the effects and events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, wars, epidemics or pandemics. Forward-looking statements often include words such as \"anticipates,” \"believes,” \"could,” \"forecast,” \"estimates,” \"expects,” \"suggest,” \"hopes,” \"intends,” \"may,” \"might,” \"plans,” \"potential,” \"predicts,” \"targets,” \"projects,” \"projections,” \"should,” \"could,” \"will,” \"would” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions.\n\nWhere in any forward-looking statement we express an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of our management, expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis. However, there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or will be achieved or accomplished. The following include some, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated:\n\n● | current economic conditions, including consumer spending levels and the price elasticity of our products;  \n---|---  \n● | the highly competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we compete;  \n● | our ability to successfully manage social, political, economic, legal and other conditions affecting our operations and our supply chain sources, such as political instability and acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters, disruption of markets, operational disruptions, changes in import or export laws, currency restrictions and currency exchange rate fluctuations;  \n● | the impact of the loss of one or more of our suppliers of finished goods or raw materials;  \n● | our ability to manage our inventory effectively and reduce inventory reserves;  \n● | our ability to optimize our global supply chain;  \n● | our ability to distribute our products effectively through our ecommerce store and through our growing wholesale distribution channel;  \n● | our ability to keep pace with changing consumer preferences;  \n● | the impact of any inadequacy, interruption or failure with respect to our information technology or any data security breach;  \n● | our ability to protect our reputation and the reputation and images of our licensed and any future proprietary brand(s);  \n● | unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or a change in our ability to realize deferred tax benefits;  \n● | our ability to comply with environmental and other laws and regulations;  \n● | changes in our relationship with our employees and costs and adverse publicity from violations of labor or environmental laws by us or our suppliers;  \n---|---  \n● | our ability to attract and retain key personnel; and  \n● | our ability to integrate and grow potential acquisitions successfully.  \n  \nThe reader should understand that the uncertainties and other factors listed above or identified elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in our Annual Report are not a comprehensive list of all the uncertainties and other factors that may affect forward-looking statements. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or the list of uncertainties and other factors that could affect those statements. You should, however, consult further disclosures and risk factors we include in Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports filed on Form 8-K.\n\n3  \n---  \n  \nPART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\n**Item 1.

(\"MGO,” \"MGO Global,” the \"Company,” \"we,” \"our” and \"us”) has built a brand acceleration platform with a focus on the acquisition, optimization and monetization of consumer brands across multiple categories. Our mission is to provide customers with unmatched variety, quality and shopping experience, while adding considerable value for MGO’s shareholders.\n\nOur accomplished leadership team encompasses decades of experience in building successful global lifestyle brands, including fashion design, marketing, technology, corporate finance and branding. We strive to continually push innovation and evolution of the consumer product cycle without compromising quality and design integrity. Through our end-to-end, scalable brand-building platform, backed by robust consumer behavioral data, we are engaged in nurturing digitally native brands that will thrive in the modern Direct to Consumer (\"DTC”) economy.\n\nWe operate our business through three subsidiaries: Americana Liberty, LLC; MGO Digital LLC and MGOTeam1, LLC (\"MGOTeam1”).\n\nOn July 18, 2024, the Company effected a reverse stock split on the Company’s common stock at a ratio of 1-for-10.\n\n**_Stand Flagpoles/Americana Liberty, LLC_**\n\nOn March 13, 2023, we obtained a royalty-free, worldwide and exclusive license (the \"License”) to the use of certain assets of Stand Co., LLC (\"Stand”) for all purposes in exchange for payment of $1.00 by the Company. The license is in perpetuity. Licensed assets include all rights to all stock keeping units (\"SKU”) of Stand sold under the names: \"Roosevelt Premium 25 foot Telescoping Flag Pole Kit,” \"20 Foot Telescoping Flag Pole Kit” and \"LED Solar Flag Pole Light;” any intellectual property and other intangible property related to SKUs, including but not limited to all rights to the brand name _Stand Flagpoles_ , domain and website www.standflagpoles.com, the Meta pages associated with _Stand Flagpoles_ brand name (in Facebook and Instagram); all manufacturer, distributor and customer contracts and relationships for SKUs; marketing materials; any commercialization rights; domain and administrative access to Stand’s Shopify account, Facebook Assets & Accounts; all historical digital and non-digital assets; and customer database since inception.\n\nIn support of our flagpole business, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Americana Liberty, LLC (\"Americana Liberty”), on March 13, 2023, which was created to advertise and sell the licensed line of _Stand Flagpoles_ and other related products, along with an expanding line of patriotic-themed products to be developed and marketed to consumers under our new _Americana Liberty_ brand.\n\nIn addition, on May 11, 2023, we executed a 12-month consulting agreement with Jason Harward, the owner of Stand Co. and nephew of our former Chief Marketing Officer of the Company. The consultant shall furnish the Company with business continuity and consulting services, substantially similar to the following: provide general advice and counsel regarding the establishment of systems and processes for direct-to-consumer (\"DTC”) and e-commerce sales and operations; provide subject matter and product-level expertise in the area of flag-poles, flags, and related products; provide consultation regarding product sourcing and distribution; and assist with the establishment, operation, optimization, and maintenance of DTC and e-commerce platforms on behalf of the Company. Consultant was compensated for services through a combination of cash or immediately available funds and restricted stock units or shares of the Company’s stock as follows: (1) cash in the amount of $150,000, paid on September 30, 2023; (2) cash in the amount of $200,000, paid on January 10, 2024, upon satisfactory performance of the consultant’s obligations under the agreement; and (3) 15,000 restricted stock units of the Company issuable on May 11, 2023. $51,587 and $109,679 were recorded as stock-based compensation expense for the fair value of the restricted stock units awarded as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The consulting agreement ended May 2024.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \n**_MGO Digital LLC_**\n\nIn November 2022, we formed MGO Digital LLC to leverage data analytics, advanced technology-enabled marketing and our leadership team’s industry relationships and expertise to identify, incubate and test market new proprietary brands and brand concepts.\n\n**_The Messi Store/MGOTeam 1 LLC_**\n\nMGOTeam1 designed, manufactured, licensed, distributed, advertised and sold a range of products under the soccer legend Lionel (\"Leo”) Messi brand, _Messi Brand_. The _Messi Brand_ is a premium lifestyle brand with a sporty edge and sold its products direct to consumers through the website www.themessistore.com.\n\nIn October 2018, the Company entered into a Trademark License Agreement with Leo Messi Management SL (\"LMM”). LMM granted the Company a worldwide non-exclusive license in order to use Leo Messi’s trademarks with the purpose of developing, manufacturing, trading and promoting the _Messi Brand_ products.\n\nOn November 20, 2021, the Company entered into a new Trademark License Agreement (\"Messi License”) with LMM to have the worldwide license to use Leo Messi’s trademarks for the purpose of developing, manufacturing, marketing and promoting his products. The Company is to pay LMM a minimum guaranteed amount on account of royalties amounting to Four Million Euros (€4,000,000) over the four-year agreement, net of taxes with the last payment due on November 15, 2024.\n\nOn March 21, 2024, MGOTeam1 assigned the Messi License to Centric Brands, LLC (\"Centric”), which paid MGOTeam1 $2,000,000 in cash and assumed the obligation to pay the minimum guaranteed amount due to LMM in 2024. The Company accounted for _The Messi Store_ segment as discontinued operations. _See Note 10._\n\n**_Business Combination Agreement with Heidmar, Inc._**\n\nOn June 18, 2024, MGO entered into a definitive Business Combination Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Business Combination Agreement”) with Heidmar, Inc., (\"HMI”), a company organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands; Heidmar Maritime Holdings Corp., a company organized under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (\"Holdings”); HMR Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings (\"Merger Sub”); and Rhea Marine Ltd. and Maistros Shipinvest Corp (the \"HMI Shareholders”). The Company, Merger Sub, Holdings, HMI and HMI Shareholders are sometimes referred to herein individually as a \"Party” and, collectively, as the \"Parties.”\n\nPursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, the Parties will effect a business combination involving the following transactions (collectively, the \"Business Combination”):\n\n(a) | Merger Sub will merge (the \"Merger”) with and into the MGO, with MGO continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings;  \n---|---  \n(b) | all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of MGO (the \"MGO Common Stock”) prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into the right to receive common shares of Holdings (the \"Holdings Common Shares”) on a one-for-one basis;  \n(c) | immediately after the effective time of the Merger, the HMI Shareholders will transfer all the outstanding shares of common stock of HMI (the \"HMI Shares”) to Holdings (the \"HMI Share Acquisition”), with HMI becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings; and  \n(d) | Holdings shall issue to the HMI Shareholders (i) at the closing of the Business Combination (the \"Closing”), a number of Holdings Common Shares equal to (x) the number of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted and as-converted basis immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, times (y) 16.6667, divided by (z) the number of outstanding HMI Shares immediately prior to the HMI Share Acquisition and (ii) after the Closing and upon the satisfaction of certain earnout conditions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement, additional Holdings Common Shares equal to 10% of the shares issued to the Heidmar Shareholders on the Closing.  \n  \n9  \n---  \n  \nMGO expects that the holders of MGO Common Stock and the Heidmar Shareholders will hold 5.66% and 94.34% (inclusive of shares to be distributed to advisors), respectively, of the Holdings Common Shares after the Closing, which is expected to occur late in the fourth quarter of 2024. \n\n**NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\n**_Basis of Presentation_**\n\nThese unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP”) and include all normal reoccurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s financial position for the periods presented.\n\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and Form 10-K/A filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2024 and June 3, 2024, respectively. Interim results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.\n\nMGOTeam1 was formed on October 11, 2018, and the Company entered into a Rollover Agreement by and among MGOTeam1 and members of MGOTeam1 on December 6, 2021. All of the members of MGOTeam1, except for one member who owns a 11.82% membership interest in MGOTeam1, exchanged all of their membership interests in MGOTeam1 for 881,800 shares of the Company’s common stock. A sole MGOTeam1 member did not rollover its 11.82% membership interest in MGOTeam1 to the Company as of December 6, 2021, and remains a member in MGOTeam1.\n\nWe account for the 11.82% minority interest in MGOTeam1 as non-controlling interest. Both the Company and MGOTeam1 were under common control, the series of contractual arrangements between the Company and MGOTeam1 on December 6, 2021 constituted a reorganization under common control and are required to be retrospectively applied to the consolidated financial statements at their historical amounts.\n\n**_Principles of Consolidation_**\n\nThe unaudited consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n**_Reclassifications_**\n\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to reflect the impact of the discontinued operations treatment in order to conform to the current period presentation. In addition, on July 18, 2024, the Company effected a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-10. Accordingly, the financial statements presented in this Form 10-Q have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split historically.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \n**_Discontinued Operations_**\n\nOn March 20, 2024, MGOTeam1 entered into a term sheet with Centric, providing for the terms and conditions for MGOTeam1 to assign and Centric to assume the existing Trademark License Agreement (\"License Agreement”), dated November 21, 2021, with an expiration date of December 31, 2024 (\"Expiration Date”), between Leo Messi Management SL (\"LMM”) and MGOTeam1. Pursuant to the term sheet, Centric assumed the Company’s minimum guarantee obligation to LMM under the License Agreement for payment due dates in 2024 amounting to €1,500,000. MGO received full payment of the $2,000,000 consideration on March 22, 2024.\n\nOn March 21, 2024, the Company, Centric and LMM signed a Deed of Novation, Assignment and Assumption (the \"Deed”) providing for MGOTeam1 to assign all of its rights and obligations under the License Agreement to Centric, and Centric has agreed to assume all of MGO’s rights and obligations in respect of the License Agreement with effect on and from March 21, 2024. No other assets or liabilities were assumed. _See Note 10_\n\n**_Use of Estimates_**\n\nThe preparation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our most critical estimates include those related to stock-based compensation, inventory and inventory allowance valuation. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n**_Cash and Cash Equivalents_**\n\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company maintains its cash with high credit quality financial institutions; at times, such balances with any one financial institution may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC”) insured limits. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $870,992 and $586,446 in excess of the FDIC limit for cash from continuing operations, respectively.\n\n**_Accounts Receivable_**\n\nAccounts receivables are carried at their estimated collectible amounts, net of any estimated allowances for credit losses. We grant unsecured credit to our wholesale customers who are deemed creditworthy. Ongoing credit evaluations are performed, and potential credit losses estimated by management are charged to operations on a regular basis. At the time any particular account receivable is deemed uncollectible, the balance is charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no allowance for credit losses from continuing operations.\n\n**_Inventory_**\n\nInventory consists of raw materials and finished goods ready for sale and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We value inventories using the weighted average costing method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. We regularly review inventory and consider forecasts of future demand, market conditions and product obsolescence. If the estimated realized value of our inventory is less than cost, we make provisions in order to reduce its carrying value to its estimated net realizable value. The write downs are recognized as a component of cost of sales. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no reserve for inventory obsolescence impairment from continuing operations.\n\n11  \n---  \n  \n**_Property and Equipment, Net_**\n\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures for renewals and improvements that significantly add to the productivity capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed. When equipment is retired or sold, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resultant gain or loss is reflected in income. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method, based on useful lives of the assets which is three years for computers, equipment and software. Depreciation expense from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was $54,384 and $21,817, respectively.\n\nSCHEDULE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET USEFUL LIFE\n\nClassification | Useful Life | June 30, 2024 (unaudited) | December 31, 2023  \n---|---|---|---  \nComputer equipment and software | 3 years | $| 309,286 | $| 308,774  \nFurniture | 3 years | 17,191 | 17,191  \nProperty and equipment, gross  \nLess: Accumulated depreciation | (60,887| ) | (6,503| )  \nProperty and equipment, net | $| 265,590 | $| 319,462  \n  \n**_Revenue Recognition_**\n\nThe Company recognizes revenues when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which it expects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company recognizes revenues following the five step model prescribed under ASU No. 2014-09: (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation.\n\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of _Stand Flagpoles_ products comprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through direct wholesale or online sales through our website _www.standflagpoles.com_. We satisfy the performance obligation and record revenues when transfer of control to the customer has occurred, based on the terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product. Control is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Control transfers to online customers at the time upon receipt of the goods. The transactions price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 30 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of sale for direct wholesale and online transactions.\n\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company generated revenues of $1,425,589 and $2,095,853 and $1,724,293 and $1,769,440, respectively, directly from consumers via our website. The Company does not have any major customers as revenue is primarily direct to individual consumers. All revenues for June 30, 2024 and 2023 were generated by customers within the United States. There were no sales to customers outside of the United States during either reporting period.\n\n_Non-Controlling Interest_\n\nAs of December 6, 2021, one shareholder did not rollover its 11.82% membership interest in MGOTeam1. According to ASC 810, _Consolidation_ , the carrying amount of the non-controlling interest (\"NCI”) will be adjusted to reflect the change in the NCI’s ownership interest in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the NCI is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized in additional paid in capital and attributed to the equity holders of the parent. The Company accounted for this portion of shares as non-controlling interest in net loss of $3,963 and $60,687 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; and net income of $223,844 and a net loss of $122,756 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively\n\n12  \n---  \n  \n_Foreign Currency_\n\nThe Company’s functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. The resulting monetary assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the subsequent balance sheet date. Revenue and expense components are translated to U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates in effect during the period. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recognized in other income, net within the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n_Segment Reporting_\n\nOn March 21, 2024, the Company discontinued operations of _The Messi Store_ due to the Deed executed with Centric, LMM and the Company. As such, the Company is no longer required to provide segment reporting, as the Company has only one reportable segment as of June 30, 2024.\n\n_Income Taxes_\n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, the Company generally considers all expected future events other than enactments of changes in the tax law. For deferred tax assets, management evaluates the probability of realizing the future benefits of such assets. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets when evidence suggests it is unlikely that the assets will be fully realized.\n\nThe Company recognizes the tax effects of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date and then only in an amount more likely than not to be sustained upon review by the tax authorities. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold is recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold is derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. The Company classifies potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as income tax expense.\n\n_Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements_\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07 – Segment Reporting (Topic ASC 280) Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The ASU improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosure about significant segment expenses. The enhancements under this update require disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM”) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, require disclosure of _other segment items_ by reportable segment and a description of the composition of _other segment items_ , require annual disclosures under ASC 280 to be provided in interim periods, clarify use of more than one measure of segment profit or loss by the CODM, require that the title of the CODM be disclosed with an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of segment profit or loss to make decisions, and require that entities with a single reportable segment provide all disclosures required by this update and required under ASC 280. ASU 2023-07 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASC 280 on January 1, 2024 and ASC 280 does not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n_Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted_\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09 – Income Taxes (Topic ASC 740) Income Taxes. The ASU improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 will become effective at the beginning of our 2025 fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. We do not expect that this guidance will have a material impact upon our financial position and results of operations.\n\n13  \n---  \n  \n**NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN**\n\nIn the pursuit of MGO’s long-term growth strategy and the development of its growing portfolio of brands, the Company has incurred continued operating losses. As of June 30, 2024, we had working capital of $1,700,344. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred losses from continuing operations of $4,306,223 and $1,564,839, respectively, and cash used in operating activities of $3,223,920 and $4,026,327, respectively. We believe the cash on hand, in connection with cash generated from future revenue, may not be sufficient to sustain continued operating losses. These factors cause substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date these financial statements were made available.\n\nOn February 8, 2024, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (\"S-3”) to provide our Company with the flexibility to issue and sell securities if and when deemed appropriate to support our ongoing business operations and in the best interest of our shareholders. The S-3 contained two prospectuses: i) a base prospectus that covers the potential offering, issuance and sale from time to time of our common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities and units in one or more offerings with a total value of up to $100,000,000; and ii) a sales agreement prospectus covering the potential offering, issuance and sale from time to time of shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1,650,000 pursuant to an equity distribution agreement entered into with the New York-based investment banking firm, Maxim Group LLC (\"At-the-Market Offering” or \"ATM”). On June 7, 2024, MGO entered into an Amendment No. 1 (\"Amendment”) to the equity distribution agreement for the ATM whereby the offering size was amended to reflect an increase in the aggregate gross sales price from $1,650,000 to $3,389,384. As of June 30, 2024, we received net proceeds from sales of our common stock pursuant to the ATM totaling an aggregate of $1,665,533.\n\n**NOTE 4 – BALANCE SHEET ITEMS**\n\n**_Inventory_**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, inventory amounted to $844,719 and $607,022, respectively.\n\n**_Prepaid Expenses_**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, prepaid expenses amounted to $314,567 and $178,425, respectively.\n\nSCHEDULE OF PREPAID EXPENSES\n\n**June 30, 2024** **(unaudited)** | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nPrepaid expenses | $| 58,693 | $| 5,577  \nPrepaid rent | 7,500 | 7,500  \nPrepaid inventories | 248,374 | 165,348  \nTotal | $| 314,567 | $| 178,425  \n  \n14  \n---  \n  \n**_Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities (Including Related Parties)_**\n\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities were $666,093 and $940,295 as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Accounts payable are mainly payables to vendors and accrued liabilities consist of mainly credit card payable and sales tax payable.\n\nSCHEDULE OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES\n\n**June 30, 2024** **(unaudited)** | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nAccounts payable | $| 314,304 | $| 281,861  \nAccounts payable, related party | 5,678 | 50,881  \nAccounts payable | 5,678 | 50,881  \nAccrued liabilities | 254,632 | 240,324  \nAccrued payroll | 91,479 | 367,230  \nTotal | $| 666,093 | $| 940,296  \n  \n**_Commitments and Contingencies_**\n\nIn January 2024, the Company entered into a financing agreement for the Company’s Directors and Officers insurance policy with First Insurance Funding at an interest rate of 7.58%, a principal balance of $225,185 and a monthly payment of $23,308 over the nine-month term of the promissory note. The policy term is January 2024 through December 2024. The loan will mature on October 12, 2024. \n\n**_Nasdaq Deficiency Notices, Hearings Panel Determinations and Reverse Stock Split_**\n\nOn April 17, 2024, the Company received a notice (the \"Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market (\"Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that 180 calendar day period that it had been provided by Nasdaq to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) on April 16, 2024 did not result in the Company regaining compliance. As a consequence, the Company is not eligible for a second 180 day period, because the Company does not meet the $5,000,000 minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for initial listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. In addition, the Notice informed the Company that in light of the foregoing and in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(A), the Nasdaq staff could no longer accept a plan for the Company to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) and this matter has become an additional and separate basis for delisting the Company’s securities from Nasdaq.\n\nThe Notice further stated unless the Company requests an appeal of the above determination by April 24, 2024, Nasdaq has determined that the Company’s securities will be scheduled for delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market and will be suspended at the opening of business on April 26, 2024, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the SEC, which will remove the Company’s securities from listing and registration on The Nasdaq Stock Market.\n\nOn April 18, 2024, the Company formally requested a hearing before Nasdaq’s Hearings Panel (the \"Panel”) and such request was granted by Nasdaq on April 19, 2024.

The parties expect that after the Closing, the Heidmar Shareholders will own 94.34% of Holdings (including shares that Holdings will distribute to MGO’s financial advisor) and the MGO stockholders will own 5.66% of Holdings, without taking into account the issuance of any Earnout Shares. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, any shares of common stock that MGO issues prior to the Closing will not change these percentages.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \nThe boards of directors of both companies have unanimously approved the signing of the BCA. The Business Combination is expected to close late in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to satisfying certain customary closing conditions, including the receipt of approvals from MGO’s stockholders and the listing of Holdings registered common shares on Nasdaq. For a more detailed description of the Business Combination, Heidmar, Holdings and the risk factors related to the Business Combination, please see our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on June 20, 2024.\n\n**_Nasdaq Deficiency Notices, Hearings Panel Determinations and Reverse Stock Split_**\n\nOn October 19, 2023, the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\"Nasdaq”) therein stating that for the 30 consecutive business day period between September 7, 2023 through October 18, 2023, the common stock of the Company had not maintained a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \"Bid Price Rule”). Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company was provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until April 16, 2024 (the \"Compliance Period”), to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule.\n\nOn April 5, 2024, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq stating that the Company is no longer in compliance with the equity standard for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) requires listed companies to maintain stockholders’ equity of at least $2,500,000 under the equity standard. Because the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023 reported stockholders’ equity of $921,747, and as of April 5, 2024 the Company does not meet the alternative standards for market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations, the Company no longer complies with Nasdaq’s Listing Rule. Nasdaq provided the Company with 45 calendar days, or until May 20, 2024, to submit a plan to regain compliance.\n\nOn April 17, 2024, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq notifying the Company that 180 calendar day period that it had been provided by Nasdaq to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) on April 16, 2024 without the Company regaining compliance and is not eligible for a second 180 day period, because the Company does not meet the $5,000,000 minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for initial listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. In addition, Nasdaq informed the Company that in light of the foregoing and in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(A), the Nasdaq staff could no longer accept a plan for the Company to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) and this matter has become an additional and separate basis for delisting the Company’s securities from Nasdaq. On April 18, 2024, the Company formally requested a hearing before Nasdaq’s Hearings Panel and such request was granted by Nasdaq on April 19, 2024. A hearing before Nasdaq’s Hearings Panel was scheduled for May 30, 2024.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \nOn May 30, 2024, Nasdaq held a hearing to make a determination on MGO’s continued listing in light of its non-compliance with above-referenced Nasdaq rules, which continued listing was granted subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including:\n\n● | on or before July 15, 2024, MGO will effect a reverse stock split at a ratio between 1-for-10 and 1-for-25, unless prior to such date MGO has been informed in writing by Nasdaq that it has regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2);  \n---|---  \n● | on or before August 15, 2024, MGO will (x) complete the transactions described to Nasdaq Hearings Panel to achieve compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (or its alternatives) and (y) demonstrate compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) by evidencing a closing bid price of $1.00 or more per share for a minimum of ten consecutive trading sessions; and  \n● | on or before August 21, 2024, MGO will file a Current Report on Form 8-K describing the transactions that have increased its stockholders’ equity and either (x) indicate that, through a balance sheet that is not older than 60 days and contains pro forma adjustments for the transactions, stockholders equity has increased to at least $2.5 million or (y) an affirmative statement that, as of the date of such report, it believes it has regained compliance with the stockholders’ equity requirement based upon the specific transactions or events described in such report.  \n  \nOn July 18, 2024, MGO effected a reverse stock split at a 1-for-10 ratio that resulted in 2,122,607 MGO shares of common stock being outstanding after the reverse stock split.\n\nOn August 12, 2024, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K stating that it believes that it is in compliance with the Nasdaq minimum stockholders’ equity requirement as of August 9, 2024.\n\n**Results of Operations for Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 as Compared to Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2023**\n\n_Revenues_\n\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, revenues decreased 17% to $1,425,589 from $1,724,293. The decrease over the prior year’s comparable period is attributable to the fact that the Company had a large marketing push at the end of the second quarter of 2023, which successfully increased revenue, however the return on marketing costs was below the Company’s desired threshold. Therefore, the Company made cognitive efforts to focus on a higher return on marketing costs subsequent to June 30, 2023. Revenues reported for the six months ended June 30, 2024 totaled $2,095,853, representing an 18% increase over revenues of $1,769,440 posted for the comparable six-month period in 2023. The increase over the prior year’s comparable three and six periods is primarily attributable to the fact that the Company did not launch sales of its _Stand Flagpole_ line of products until mid-March 2023.\n\n_Cost of Sales and Gross Profit_\n\nCost of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 decreased 32% to $346,356 from $508,861, respectively. This resulted in a gross profit of $1,079,233 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, which compared to $1,215,432 for the same three-month period in 2023. The 5% increase in gross profit was due to the Company optimizing sales prices while reducing purchasing costs.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \nFor the reason mentioned above, cost of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2024 totaled $514,088, down 2% from $526,470 reported for the same six-month period in the prior year. This resulted in a 5% increase in gross profit of $1,581,765 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $1,242,970 for the six-month ended June 30, 2023.\n\n_Operating Expenses_\n\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, total operating expenses rose 213% to $2,496,148 as compared to total operating expenses of $797,485 for the three months ended June 30, 2023, due primarily to a 213% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, which rose to $2,496,148 from $797,485, respectively; and a 22% decrease in marketing and e-commerce expenses, declining to $1,024,062 from $1,320,100, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related to workforce expansion, stock-based compensation expenses which were not occurring in the prior year, and increased costs of legal and accounting expenses pertaining to executing capital raises during the quarter and advancing the business combination process with Heidmar. The decrease in marketing expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2024 when compared to the prior year’s same three-month period is attributable to the fact that the Company had a large marketing push at the end of the second quarter of 2023, which successfully increased revenue, however the return on marketing costs was below the Company’s desired threshold. Therefore, the Company made cognitive efforts to focus on a higher return on marketing spend.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the six-month period ended June 30, 2024 was $5,887,524, representing a 107% increase compared to $2,837,685 in total operating expenses for the same six months in 2023. The increase was largely attributable to a 189% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, which rose to $4,325,832 from $1,497,811, respectively; and a 17% increase in marketing and e-commerce expenses, which climbed to $1,561,692 from $1,339,874, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related to workforce expansion, stock-based compensation expenses which were not occurring in the prior year, and increased costs of legal and accounting expenses pertaining to executing capital raises and advancing the business combination process with Heidmar during the first six months of 2024.\n\n_Other (Income) Expenses_\n\nTotal other income (expenses) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 was ($1,111) and ($464), respectively, compared to total other interest income of $29,820 and $29,876 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively.\n\n_Net Loss_\n\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, net loss from continuing operations was $2,442,088, a 180% increase from a net loss of $872,333 reported for the same three-month period in 2023. Net loss from discontinued operations decreased to $33,527 from a net loss of $525,872 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Overall, net loss totaled $2,475,615 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $1,398,205 for the same three-month period ended June 30, 2023. After factoring a net loss of $3,963 and a net loss of $60,687 for non-controlling interest for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, net loss attributable to MGO stockholders was $2,471,652, or $1.35. loss per share, and $1,337,518 or $0.94 loss per share, respectively.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, net loss from continuing operations was $4,306,223, a 175% increase from a net loss of $1,564,839 reported for the same six-month period in 2023. Net income from discontinued operations rose to $1,893,771 from a net loss of $1,053,491 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as a result of the assignment of the Messi License to Centric. Overall, net loss totaled $2,412,452 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $2,618,330 posted for the same six-month period ended June 30, 2023. After factoring net income of $223,844 and a net loss of $122,756 for non-controlling interest for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, net loss attributable to MGO stockholders was $2,636,296, or $1.57 loss per share, and $2,495,574, or $1.79 loss per share, respectively.\n\n25  \n---  \n  \n**Cash Flows**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, cash on hand from continuing operations was $1,301,585, as compared to $836,446 as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 56%. The increase was primarily attributable to the assignment of the _Messi Brand_ to Centric in exchange for $2,000,000 in cash and their assumption of our obligation to pay €1.5 million in royalty payments to LMM in 2024, as well as net proceeds aggregating $1,665,534 received from the sale of our common stock pursuant to our At-The-Market Offering (\"ATM”). Until such time that the Company fully implements its growth strategy or completes its business combination with Heidmar, it expects to continue generating operating losses in the foreseeable future, primarily due to higher corporate overhead, higher marketing and inventory expenses and costs associated with being a public company.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, cash used in operations was $3,223,920, a decrease of 20% as compared to cash used of $4,026,328 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to the assignment of the _Messi Brand_ to Centric in exchange for $2,000,000 in cash and their assumption of our obligation to pay €1.5 million in royalty payments to Leo Messi Management in 2024.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was $1,999,488, compared to cash used in investing activities of $137,614 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The 1553% decrease was due to no significant purchases of property and equipment occurring during the six months ended June 30, 2024, offset by the $2,000,000 in proceeds received from the assignment of the _Messi Brand_ to Centric.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, cash provided by financing activities was $1,689,571, a decrease of 79% as compared to cash provided by financing activities of $8,183,515 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease was directly related to the completion of the Company’s initial public offering in January 2023.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had working capital of $1,700,344. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, we incurred a loss from operations of $4,305,759, inclusive of $4,325,832 for general and administrative expenses, including higher workforce expenses, stock-based compensation expense, third-party logistics services, professional fees and rent expense for office space, as well as $1,561,692 for increased marketing and ecommerce expenses.\n\nOn March 21, 2024, MGO assigned the Messi License to Centric, which paid the Company $2,000,000 in cash and assumed the obligation to pay the minimum guaranteed amount due to LMM in 2024. Effective as of that date, the Company discontinued operations on _The Messi Store_.\n\nOn February 12, 2024, the SEC deemed the Company’s shelf registration statement on Form S-3 effective. This registration statement contained two prospectuses: 1) a base prospectus that covers the potential offering, issuance, and sale from time to time of our common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities and units in one or more offerings with a total value of up to $100,000,000; and 2) a sales agreement prospectus (\"ATM”) covering the potential offering, issuance, and sale from time to time of shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $1,650,000 pursuant to an equity distribution agreement with Maxim Group LLC. On June 7, 2024, MGO entered into an Amendment No. 1 (\"Amendment”) to the equity distribution agreement for the ATM whereby the offering size was amended to reflect an increase in the aggregate gross sales price from $1,650,000 to $3,389,384. As of August 19, 2024, the Company had received gross proceeds of $2,2,788,588 from sales of shares of our common stock pursuant to the ATM.\n\nIf the Company is unable to generate significant sales growth in the near term and raise additional capital, there is a risk that the Company could default on additional obligations; and could be required to discontinue or significantly reduce the scope of its operations if no other means of financing operations are available. Moreover, any additional equity financing that we obtain may dilute the ownership held by our existing shareholders. The economic dilution to our shareholders will be significant if our stock price does not materially increase, or if the effective price of any sale is below the price paid by a particular shareholder. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities or any other adjustment that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. As such, the aforementioned factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period.\n\n26  \n---  \n  \n**Critical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments, and Use of Estimates**\n\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"US GAAP”). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our most critical estimates include those related to revenue recognition, inventories and reserves for excess and obsolescence, accounting for stock-based awards, and income taxes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our existing critical accounting policies which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Since our inception, except for standard operating leases, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.\n\n**Inflation**\n\nOver the past 18 months, inflation has adversely affected our business, financial condition, and results of operations by increasing our overall cost structure, and such affects will be further exacerbated if we are unable to achieve commensurate increases in the prices, we charge our customers. The existence of inflation in the economy has resulted in, and may continue to result in, higher interest rates and capital costs, shipping costs, supply shortages, increased costs of labor, weakening exchange rates, and other similar effects. As a result of inflation, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, cost increases. In addition, poor economic and market conditions, including a potential recession, may negatively impact market sentiment, decreasing the demand for sportswear and outerwear, which would adversely affect our operating income and results of operations. If we are unable to take effective measures in a timely manner to mitigate the impact of inflation, as well as a potential recession, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n**Climate Change**\n\nOur opinion is that neither climate change, nor governmental regulations related to climate change, have had, or are expected to have, any material effect on our operations.\n\n27  \n---  \n  \n**New Accounting Pronouncements**\n\nThere were certain updates recently issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB”), most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n**ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK**\n\nAs a \"smaller reporting company” as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this Item.\n\n**ITEM 4.
