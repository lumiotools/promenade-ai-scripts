(NASDAQ: GPCR), a clinical-stage global biopharmaceutical company developing novel oral small molecule therapeutics for metabolic and cardiopulmonary diseases, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and highlighted recent corporate achievements.\n\n“We are in a period of great momentum and execution at Structure Therapeutics, having begun our next phase of development with GSBR-1290,” said Raymond Stevens, Ph.D., Founder and CEO of Structure Therapeutics. “The ACCESS and ACCESS II studies are designed to generate a comprehensive data set that we believe will provide additional insights into the differentiated profile of GSBR-1290 as a potential best-in-class oral small molecule GLP-1 receptor (GLP1-R) agonist. We also plan to declare our first oral small molecule amylin development candidate later this quarter. We look forward to 2025 as a pivotal year for Structure.”\n\n**Recent and Upcoming Milestones**\n\n**_Oral Small Molecule Selective GLP-1R agonist for Obesity (GSBR-1290)_**\n\n  * Structure announced today a comprehensive development program to further evaluate GSBR-1290 in adults living with obesity or overweight, consisting of the Phase 2b ACCESS study and the Phase 2 ACCESS II study. Structure designed the ACCESS and ACCESS II studies to generate a robust dataset to enable optimized Phase 3 clinical development with the goal of bringing GSBR-1290 to patients as rapidly as possible. \n    * ACCESS aims to enroll approximately 220 adults living with obesity, or overweight with a weight-related comorbidity, and is designed to evaluate doses up to 120 mg and optimize titration regimens of GSBR-1290 over 36 weeks, following a four-week titration schedule.\n    * ACCESS II aims to enroll approximately 82 adults living with obesity, or overweight with a weight-related comorbidity, and is designed to evaluate higher doses (180 mg and 240 mg) of GSBR-1290 over 36 weeks.\n  * The first patients have been dosed in the Phase 2b ACCESS study and Structure expects to dose the first patient in ACCESS II by the end of 2024. Topline data from the ACCESS and ACCESS II studies are expected in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\n**_Oral Small Molecule GLP-1R Combination Programs: Amylin, GIPR, Apelin Receptor (APJR)_**\n\n  * _Oral Small Molecule Amylin Program_ : Structure Therapeutics is also developing amylin receptor agonists (dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonists) for potential use either alone or in combination with GLP-1R agonists to treat obesity and associated diseases. Structure recently presented preclinical data related to its amylin program at ObesityWeek® and expects to select a development candidate by the end of 2024.\n  * _Oral Small Molecule GIPR Program_ : Structure Therapeutics is developing a GIPR selective agonist and GLP‑1R/GIPR combinations to treat obesity and associated diseases, and expects to select a development candidate in the first half of 2025.\n  * _Oral Small Molecule APJR Program_ : Structure Therapeutics is evaluating ANPA-0073, a Phase 2 ready biased APJR agonist for potential selective or muscle-sparing weight loss. ANPA-0073 is also being evaluated for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Structure Therapeutics has completed a Phase 1 single-ascending and multiple-ascending dose study, in which ANPA-0073 was generally well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. Structure Therapeutics is conducting long term chronic GLP-toxicology studies expected to be completed in 2025.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n**Cash Position:** Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $915.3 million on September 30, 2024. The Company expects its current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to fund projected operations and key clinical milestones through at least 2027, including all GSBR-1290 studies for Phase 3 readiness but excluding Phase 3 registrational studies.\n\n**Research and Development (R &D) Expenses:** R&D expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $32.6 million, as compared to $17.5 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in research programs and employee expenses related to increases in personnel, as well as the advancement of the Company’s GLP-1R agonist franchise.\n\n**General and Administrative (G &A) Expenses:** G&A expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $13.2 million, as compared to $8.6 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases in employee related expenses and professional services as the Company expanded its infrastructure to drive the growth in its operations as a publicly-traded company.\n\n**Net Loss:** Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 totaled $34.0 million, with non-cash share-based compensation expense of $6.0 million, compared to $23.9 million for the third quarter of 2023 with non-cash share-based compensation expense of $1.9 million.\n\n**ACCESS and ACCESS II Conference Call and Webcast Information** Structure Therapeutics will host a conference call and webcast today, November 13, 2024 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the ACCESS and ACCESS II clinical studies.

(NASDAQ: GPCR), a clinical-stage global biopharmaceutical company developing novel oral small molecule therapeutics for metabolic and pulmonary diseases, today announced the first patients have been dosed in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b ACCESS clinical study evaluating GSBR-1290 in participants living with obesity, or overweight with a weight-related comorbidity. GSBR-1290 is an orally-available, nonpeptide small molecule glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist that has demonstrated competitive weight loss and generally favorable safety and tolerability results in previous studies with once-daily dosing.\n\nThe Phase 2b ACCESS study is part of a comprehensive development program that also includes the Phase 2 ACCESS II study. ACCESS aims to enroll approximately 220 adults living with obesity, or overweight with a weight-related comorbidity, and is designed to evaluate multiple doses (up to 120 mg) of GSBR-1290 with an optimized “low and slow” titration regimen over 36 weeks. ACCESS II aims to enroll approximately 82 adults living with obesity, or overweight with a weight-related comorbidity, and is designed to evaluate two additional higher doses of GSBR-1290 (180 and 240 mg) over 36 weeks, following the same titration scheme as the ACCESS study. Topline data from both the ACCESS and ACCESS II studies are expected in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\n“We have designed the ACCESS and ACCESS II studies to generate a robust dataset to determine the target doses to move into Phase 3 clinical development with the goal of bringing GSBR-1290 to patients as rapidly as possible,” said Raymond Stevens, Ph.D., Founder and CEO of Structure Therapeutics. “In addition to its very competitive efficacy and tolerability profile, as an oral, nonpeptide small molecule GLP-1R agonist, we believe GSBR-1290 offers attractive manufacturing scalability advantages over peptide-based GLP-1R therapies, and we are excited to advance GSBR-1290 as our lead program. GSBR-1290 is just one of many compounds in our oral small molecule obesity portfolio, followed by our oral small molecule amylin development candidate which we expect to announce later this quarter.”\n\n“Our 36-week ACCESS study is designed to assess multiple therapeutic doses of GSBR-1290 with a start low and go slow 4-week titration approach to optimize tolerability and increase the likelihood of maximizing weight loss,” said Blai Coll, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer of Structure Therapeutics. “Based on the data from our earlier studies, clean safety profile and proportional exposure of GSBR-1290, we are also initiating the ACCESS II study to evaluate higher doses of GSBR-1290. We look forward to data from both studies expected in the fourth quarter of 2025.”\n\n**About the Phase 2b ACCESS Study** ACCESS is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2b dose-range finding study of GSBR-1290 in approximately 220 adult participants living with obesity (body mass Index ≥ 30 kg/m2), or overweight (body mass index ≥ 27 kg/m2) with at least one weight-related comorbidity. Participants will start at 5mg of GSBR-1290 (or placebo) with a 4-week titration schedule, reaching target doses of 45 mg, 90 mg and 120 mg. The primary endpoint is percent change in body weight from baseline to week 36. Secondary endpoints include safety and tolerability of the monthly titration scheme, as well as pharmacokinetics of GSBR-1290.\n\n**About the Phase 2 ACCESS II Study** ACCESS II is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 dose-range finding study of GSBR-1290 in approximately 82 adult participants living with obesity, or overweight with at least one weight-related comorbidity. The study is designed to evaluate two higher doses of GSBR-1290. Participants will start at 5mg of GSBR-1290 (or placebo) and will follow a 4-week titration schedule up to target doses of 120 mg, 180 mg and 240 mg.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Information** Structure Therapeutics will host a conference call and webcast today, November 13, 2024 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

Through Structure Therapeutics’ structure-based drug discovery platform, GSBR-1290 was designed to be a biased GPCR agonist, which selectively activates the G-protein signaling pathway. Beyond GSBR-1290, Structure Therapeutics is developing next generation oral small molecules including amylin receptor agonists, and other combination GLP-1 receptor agonists candidates such as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucagon and apelin oral small molecules.\n\n**About Structure Therapeutics** Structure Therapeutics is a science-driven clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing innovative oral small molecule treatments for chronic metabolic and cardiopulmonary conditions with significant unmet medical needs. Utilizing its next generation structure-based drug discovery platform, the Company has established a robust GPCR-targeted pipeline, featuring multiple wholly-owned proprietary clinical-stage small molecule compounds designed to surpass the manufacturing scalability limitations of traditional biologic and peptide therapies and be accessible to more patients around the world.
