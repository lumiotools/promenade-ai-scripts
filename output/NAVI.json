          "content": "NEWS RELEASE\nFor immediate release\nNavient announces strategic actions following in-depth business review\n• Will outsource student loan servicing and create variable expense model\n• Initiates exploration of strategic options for business processing division, including\npotential divestment\n• Intends to streamline shared service infrastructure and corporate footprint\nHERNDON, Va., Jan. 30, 2024 — Navient (Nasdaq: NAVI) today announced strategic actions\nto simplify the company, reduce its expense base, and enhance its flexibility as a result of the\nin-depth review overseen by the Board of Directors over the past several months.\nThe strategic actions include outsourcing the servicing of its student loan portfolio to a third\nparty; exploring strategic options for its business processing division—including potential\ndivestment; and streamlining the company’s corporate functions to align with a simplified\nbusiness model.\n“After a thorough review, we are announcing targeted actions intended to simplify our business,\nreduce our expense base, and increase our financial and operating flexibility,” said David\nYowan, president and CEO of Navient. “Over the longer-term, we believe these actions will\nincrease the value shareholders derive from our loan portfolios and the returns we can achieve\non business-building investments. As we embark on this important work, we also remain\nfocused on running and growing our business and meeting the needs of our borrowers and\nclients. We look forward to continuing to provide updates as we establish a new foundation for\nNavient’s future success.”\nKey elements of the steps announced today include the following.\nAdopt a variable, outsourced servicing model\nNavient has entered into a binding letter of intent that will transition its student loan servicing to\nMOHELA, a leading provider of student loan servicing for government and commercial\nenterprises. This transaction is intended to create a variable cost structure for the servicing of\nour student loan portfolios and provides attractive unit economics across a wide range of\nservicing volume scenarios. Navient and MOHELA will work toward ensuring a seamless\ntransition in the coming months and providing customers with uninterrupted servicing of their\nloans.\nExplore strategic options for the business processing division\nIn addition, Navient has launched a process to explore a range of value-creating options for its\nbusiness processing division. Through various subsidiary brands, this division provides high-\nquality business processing services for a variety of government and healthcare clients,\nincluding hospitals, toll-road authorities, state revenue divisions, and federal agencies. With the\ndecision to outsource student loan servicing, exploring options for the business processing\ndivision increases the opportunities for shared cost reduction. Navient is working with financial\nand legal advisors to assist the company in exploring strategic options for this division, which\nmay include a sale of the division in whole or in part.\nStreamline shared services infrastructure and corporate footprint\nAs it implements these actions, Navient also plans to reshape its shared services functions and\ncorporate footprint to align with the needs of a more focused, flexible and streamlined company.\nBased on full-year 2023 operating expenses, approximately $400 million, which is net of\nexpected outsourced servicing expenses, could be eliminated under a scenario in which the\nthree steps announced today were completed. That scenario would also not include business\nprocessing revenue under a full-business divestiture scenario. Actual future expense reductions\nwill depend on a number of factors including the details of the servicing outsourcing transaction\nand the potential strategic options for the business processing division.\nImplementation of these transactions is expected to begin in 2024 and is expected to be largely\ncomplete over the next 18 to 24 months.\nSupplemental materials and fourth quarter 2023 earnings\nSupplemental materials about these strategic actions will be posted on Navient.com/investors\ntomorrow morning, Jan. 31, by 7 a.m.\nAs previously announced, Navient’s fourth quarter 2023 earnings results will be released\ntomorrow by 7 a.m. on Navient.com/investors. In addition to being available on the company’s\ninvestor website, the results will be furnished on a Form 8-K available at SEC.gov.\nIn addition, Navient will hold a live audio webcast tomorrow at 8 a.m. ET to provide in-depth\ncommentary on results of the business review and discuss its financial results. The webcast will\nbe hosted by David Yowan, president and CEO, Edward Bramson, vice chair of the Navient\nBoard of Directors, and Joe Fisher, CFO.\nAnalysts and investors who wish to ask questions are requested to pre-register at\nNavient.com/investors at least 15 minutes ahead of start time to receive their personal dial-in\naccess details.

Definitions for capitalized terms in this presentation not defined herein can be found in\nthe 2022 Form 10-K. This presentation contains “forward-looking statements,” within the meaning of the federal securities law, about our business, and prospects and other information that is based on management’s current expectations as of the\ndate of this presentation. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about the company’s beliefs, opinions or expectations and statements that assume or are dependent upon future events, are forward-looking statements and\noften contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “see,” “will,” “would,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “goal,” or “target.” Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that\nmay cause actual results to be materially different from those reflected in such forward-looking statements.\nFor Navient, these factors include, among others, the risks and uncertainties associated with:\n• the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n• changes in the macroeconomic environment, and volatility in market conditions including interest rates, the value of equities and other financial assets;\n• the risks and uncertainties associated with increases in financing costs;\n• the availability of financing or limits on our liquidity resulting from disruptions in the capital markets or other factors;\n• unanticipated increases in costs associated with compliance with federal, state or local laws and regulations;\n• changes in the demand for education finance and business processing solutions or other changes in marketplaces in which we compete (including increased competition);\n• changes in accounting standards including but not limited to changes pertaining to loan loss reserves and estimates or other accounting standards that may impact our operations;\n• adverse outcomes in any significant litigation to which the company is a party;\n• credit risk associated with the company’s underwriting standards or exposure to third parties, including counterparties to hedging transactions; and\n• changes in the terms of education loans and the educational credit marketplace (including changes resulting from the CARES Act or other new laws and the implementation of existing laws).\nThe company could also be affected by, among other things:\n• unanticipated repayment trends on education loans including prepayments or deferrals resulting from new interpretations of current laws, rules or regulations or future laws, executive orders or other policy initiatives which operate to encourage or\nrequire consolidation, abolish existing or create additional income-based repayment or debt forgiveness programs or establish other policies and programs which may increase the prepayment rates on education loans and accelerate repayment of\nthe bonds in our securitization trusts;\n• reductions to our credit ratings, the credit ratings of asset-backed securitizations we sponsor or the credit ratings of the United States of America;\n• failures of our operating systems or infrastructure or those of third-party vendors;\n• risks related to cybersecurity including the potential disruption of our systems or those of our third-party vendors or customers or potential disclosure of confidential customer information;\n• damage to our reputation resulting from cyber-breaches or litigation;\n• failure to successfully implement cost-cutting initiatives and adverse effects of such initiatives on our business;\n• failure to adequately integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions including delays or errors in converting portfolio acquisitions to our servicing platform;\n• changes in law and regulations whether new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations applicable to any of our businesses or activities or those of our vendors, suppliers or customers;\n• changes in the general interest rate environment, including the availability of any relevant money-market index rate, including LIBOR or SOFR, or the relationship between the relevant money-market index rate and the rate at which our assets are\npriced;\n• our ability to successfully effectuate any acquisitions and other strategic initiatives;\n• activities by shareholder activists, including a proxy contest or any unsolicited takeover proposal;\n• changes in general economic conditions, including the potential impact of persistent inflation; and\n• the other factors that are described in the “Risk Factors” section of Navient’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, and in our other reports filed with the SEC.\nThe preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements also requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions including estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates or assumptions may prove to\nbe incorrect and actual results could differ materially. All forward-looking statements contained in this release are qualified by these cautionary statements and are made only as of the date of this release. The company does not undertake any\nobligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements except as required by law.\nNavient reports financial results on a GAAP basis and also provides certain non-GAAP performance measures, including Core Earnings, Adjusted Tangible Equity Ratio, and various other non-GAAP financial measures derived from Core\nEarnings. When compared to GAAP results, Core Earnings exclude the impact of: (1) mark-to-market gains/losses on derivatives; and (2) goodwill and acquired intangible asset amortization and impairment. Navient provides Core Earnings\nmeasures because this is what management uses when making management decisions regarding Navient’s performance and the allocation of corporate resources. Navient Core Earnings are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be\ncomparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. See pages 18 to 28 of Navient’s fourth quarter 2023 earnings release available at Navient.com/investors for descriptions and reconciliations related to 2023 results. See pages\n46 to 63 of Navient’s 2014 Form 10-K available at SEC.gov for 2014 descriptions and reconciliations related to 2014 results.Reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures are not provided because the company is unable to\nprovide such reconciliations without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting the occurrence and financial impact of certain items, including, but not limited to, the impact of any mark-to-market gains/losses\nresulting from our use of derivative instruments to hedge our economic risks.\nConfidential and proprietary information © 2024 Navient Solutions, LLC.

Definitions for capitalized terms in this presentation not defined herein can\nbe found in the 2023 Form 10-K. This presentation contains “forward-looking statements,” within the meaning of the federal securities law, about our business, and prospectus and other information that is based on management’s current\nexpectations as of the date of this presentation. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs, opinions, or expectations and statements that assume or are dependent upon future events, are forward-looking\nstatements and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “see,” “will,” “would,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “goals,” or “target.” Such statements are based on management's expectations as of the date of\nthis release and involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements.\nFor Navient, these factors include, among other things:\n• general economic conditions, including the potential impact of inflation and interest rates on Navient and its clients and customers and on the creditworthiness of third parties; and\n• increased defaults on education loans held by us.\nThe company could also be affected by, among other things:\n• unanticipated repayment trends on education loans including prepayments or deferrals resulting from new interpretations or the timing of the execution and implementation of current laws, rules or regulations or future laws, executive orders or\nother policy initiatives that operate to encourage or require consolidation, abolish existing or create additional income-based repayment or debt forgiveness programs or establish other policies and programs or extensions of previously\nannounced deadlines which may increase or decrease the prepayment rates on education loans and accelerate or slow down the repayment of the bonds in our securitization trusts;\n• a reduction in our credit ratings;\n• changes to applicable laws, rules, regulations and government policies and expanded regulatory and governmental oversight;\n• changes in the general interest rate environment, including the availability of any relevant money-market index rate or the relationship between the relevant money-market index rate and the rate at which our assets are priced;\n• the interest rate characteristics of our assets do not always match those of our funding arrangements;\n• adverse market conditions or an inability to effectively manage our liquidity risk or access liquidity could negatively impact us;\n• the cost and availability of funding in the capital markets; our ability to earn Floor Income and our ability to enter into hedges relative to that Floor Income are dependent on the future interest rate environment and therefore is variable;\n• our use of derivatives exposes us to credit and market risk;\n• our ability to continually and effectively align our cost structure with our business operations;\n• a failure or breach of our operating systems, infrastructure or information technology systems;\n• failure by any third party providing us material services or products or a breach or violation of law by one of these third parties;\n• our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment;\n• acquisitions, strategic initiatives and investments or divestitures that we pursue;\n• shareholder activism; reputational risk and social factors; and\n• the other factors that are described in the “Risk Factors” section of Navient’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in our other reports filed with the SEC.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements also requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions including estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates or assumptions may prove to be\nincorrect and actual results could differ materially. All forward-looking statements contained in this release are qualified by these cautionary statements and are made only as of the date of this release. The company does not undertake any\nobligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements except as required by law.\nNavient reports financial results on a GAAP basis and also provides certain non-GAAP performance measures, including Core Earnings, Adjusted Tangible Equity Ratio, and various other non-GAAP financial measures derived from Core\nEarnings. When compared to GAAP results, Core Earnings exclude the impact of: (1) mark-to-market gains/losses on derivatives; and (2) goodwill and acquired intangible asset amortization and impairment. Navient provides Core Earnings\nmeasures because this is what management uses when making management decisions regarding Navient’s performance and the allocation of corporate resources. Navient Core Earnings are not defined terms within GAAP and may not be\ncomparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. For additional information, see Core Earnings in Navient’s third quarter 2024 earnings release and pages 13 – 14 of this presentation for a complete reconciliation between\nGAAP net income and Core Earnings.\nConfidential and proprietary information © 2024 Navient Solutions, LLC.

In addition to financial results reported on a GAAP basis, Navient also provides certain performance measures which are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. Definitions for the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations are provided below and in the body of the company’s quarterly earnings release, except\nthat reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures are not provided because the company is unable to provide such reconciliations without unreasonable effort\ndue to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting the occurrence and financial impact of certain items, including, but not limited to, the impact of any mark-to-market\ngains/losses resulting from our use of derivative instruments to hedge our economic risks. The following non-GAAP financial measures are presented within this presentation; for\nfurther detail and reconciliations, see pages 13 – 14 of this presentation and pages 18 – 29 of Navient’s third quarter 2024 earnings release:\nCore Earnings – The difference between the company’s Core Earnings and its GAAP results is that Core Earnings excludes the impacts of: (1) mark-to-market gains/losses on\nderivatives and (2) goodwill and acquired intangible asset amortization and impairment. Management uses Core Earnings in making decisions regarding the company’s\nperformance and the allocation of corporate resources and, as a result, our segment results are presented using Core Earnings. In addition, Navient’s equity investors, credit\nrating agencies and debt capital investors use these Core Earnings measures to monitor the company’s business performance.\nAdjusted Tangible Equity Ratio (ATE) – The Adjusted Tangible Equity Ratio measures Navient’s tangible equity, relative to its tangible assets. We adjust this ratio to exclude\nthe assets and equity associated with our FFELP portfolio because FFELP Loans are no longer originated and the FFELP portfolio bears a 3% maximum loss exposure under the\nterms of the federal guaranty. Management believes that excluding this portfolio from the ratio enhances its usefulness to investors. To determine Adjusted Tangible Equity\nRatios, we calculate the Adjusted Tangible Equity (GAAP Total Equity less Goodwill & Acquired Intangible Assets less Equity held for FFELP Loans) and divide by Adjusted\nTangible Assets (Total Assets less Goodwill & Acquired Intangible Assets less FFELP Loans).\nEarnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization Expense (“EBITDA”) – This metric measures the operating performance of the Business Processing\nsegment and is used by management and our equity investors to monitor operating performance and determine the value of those businesses.\nAllowance for Loan Losses Excluding Expected Future Recoveries on Previously Fully Charged-off Loans – This metric excludes the expected future recoveries on\npreviously fully charged-off loans to better reflect the current expected credit losses remaining in connection with the loans on balance sheet that have not charged off.\n2. Projections are based on internal estimates and assumptions and are subject to ongoing review and modification. Education loan portfolio projections are forecasted as of the\nend of the quarter using a SOFR forward curve, are agnostic to timing discrepancies, and assume funding spreads remain static. These projections may prove to be incorrect.\nConfidential and proprietary information © 2024 Navient Solutions, LLC.
