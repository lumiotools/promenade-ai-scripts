Platform refers to the performance of CWD itself, excluding the performance of certain assets & funds that are included in our consolidated results, as required by the United States generally accepted accounting standards (“GAAP”). Management believes that Platform performance offers the most meaningful information needed to understand the value of CWD. The assets and funds that are consolidated into our GAAP presentation are included because Caliber is a guarantor of debt held by these assets and funds. \n\nWhile GAAP consolidation rules require CWD to include the performance and cash flows of these assets & funds in our consolidated financial information, CWD does not benefit from the performance of those assets & funds, except to the extent that CWD earns fees from managing the assets and funds (which are included in the Platform results). Management believes presenting Platform results, which exclude consolidated assets, directly shows the business performance that CWD stockholders benefit from. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Platform Financial Highlights (compared to third quarter 2023)**\n\n  * Platform revenue of $7.4 million, a 98.9% increase \n    * Asset management revenue of $7.2 million drove the stated results \n    * Performance allocations of $0.2 million \n  * Platform earnings of $0.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to Platform loss of $3.4 million, or $0.16 per diluted share \n  * Platform Adjusted EBITDA of $2.4 million, a 259.6% increase compared to Platform Adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.5 million \n  * Fair value assets under management (“FV AUM”) of $807.0 million, an 8.9% increase compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to the acquisitions of our West Ridge property in Colorado and Canyon Corporate Plaza property in Arizona, net market appreciation, and construction activity; partially offset by land parcel sales at Johnstown, the sale of a school property, and the sale of a self-storage property \n  * Managed capital of $485.3 million, a 10.9% increase compared to December 31, 2023, with originations of $61.4 million, offset by redemptions of $13.8 million \n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n\"We delivered strong third quarter results with a 98.9% increase nearly doubling Platform revenue, primarily driven by higher fee income from loan placements and offerings,” said Chris Loeffler, CEO of Caliber. “This top-line growth, paired with the impact of our recent cost-reduction initiatives, has boosted our performance, resulting in positive Platform adjusted EBITDA and Platform earnings during the third quarter, ahead of our fourth-quarter 2024 target.” \n\n“While fundraising and commercial real estate remain volatile, for reasons I look forward to discussing on today’s call, our strategic and tactical progress towards consistent, profitable growth is clear.” \n\n**Business Update**\n\nThe following are key milestones completed both during and subsequent to the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n  * On July 2, 2024, Caliber announced the sale of 24-7 Automated Storage, a 348-unit self-storage facility in Casa Grande, Ariz., for $4.6 million. \n  * On October 1, 2024, Caliber announced the launch of its innovative new Qualified Opportunity Zone Fund Roll-Up program and completed its first merger with a third-party fund resulting in a $14 million increase in managed capital in Caliber’s existing qualified opportunity zone fund (“QOF”), the Caliber Tax Advantaged Opportunity Zone Fund, LP (CTAF I). \n  * On October 8, 2024, Caliber announced that it reached a definitive agreement with Satori Collective where Satori will contribute seven hotel properties to Caliber subsidiary Caliber Hospitality Trust (CHT), an externally advised private hospitality corporation. The contribution, when closed, is expected to increase assets under management (“AUM”) by approximately $120 million. \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Consolidated Financial Results (compared to third quarter 2023)**\n\nCaliber’s GAAP consolidated financial statements have been impacted by the deconsolidation of certain variable interest entities’ assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These entities were deconsolidated because Caliber was no longer a guarantor on the respective entities’ third party debt. Caliber’s GAAP financial metrics are impacted by the timing of deconsolidation. As such, prior periods presented may not be comparable due to the deconsolidation of certain entities in the current period. \n\n  * Total consolidated revenue of $11.3 million, a 33.6% decrease reflecting the deconsolidation of Caliber Hospitality, LP and CHT, in March 2024. Caliber estimates total revenue would have increased had the deconsolidated asset results not been included in the Q3 2023 comparison period. \n  * Consolidated net income attributable to Caliber of $0.1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to net loss attributable to Caliber of $3.4 million or $0.16 per diluted share \n  * Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $4.2 million, compared to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA loss of $3.2 million. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nCaliber will host a conference call today, Tuesday, November 12, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results and business outlook. To access this call, dial 1-800-717-1738 (domestic) or 1-646-307-1865 (international).

Management believes that the Platform view of Caliber’s performance is more meaningful to a CWD shareholder since it includes all revenues and expenses generated by Caliber and its wholly owned subsidiaries. \n\n**ASSET MANAGEMENT PLATFORM SEGMENT(1)** **(AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS) (UNAUDITED)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**  \n**Platform** |  **Impact of Consolidated Fund

As a result of these guarantor commitments, Caliber is required under GAAP to include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of those entities even though a shareholder of CWD stock is neither entitled to nor exposed by those entities’ benefits or obligations. This accounting outcome also removes revenues that we earn from those entities, which a shareholder of CWD stock would be entitled to.

We monitor two types of information with regard to our AUM: \n\n  1. Managed Capital – we define this as the total capital we fundraise from our customers as investments in our funds. It also includes fundraising into our corporate note program, the proceeds of which were used, in part, to invest in or loan to our funds. We use this information to monitor, among other things, the amount of ‘preferred return’ that would be paid at the time of a distribution and the potential to earn a performance fee over and above the preferred return at the time of the distribution. Our fund management fees are based on a percentage of managed capital or a percentage of assets under management, and monitoring the change and composition of managed capital provides relevant data points for Caliber management to further calculate and predict future earnings. \n  2. Fair Value (“FV”) AUM – we define this as the aggregate fair value of the real estate assets we manage and from which we derive management fees, performance revenues and other fees and expense reimbursements. We estimate the value of these assets quarterly to help make sale and hold decisions and to evaluate whether an existing asset would benefit from refinancing or recapitalization. This also gives us insight into the value of our carried interest at any point in time. We also utilize FV AUM to predict the percentage of our portfolio which may need development services in a given year, fund management services (such as refinance), and brokerage services. As we control the decision to hire for these services, our service income is generally predictable based upon our current portfolio AUM and our expectations for AUM growth in the year forecasted. \n\n\n\n**Non-GAAP Measures**\n\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, make strategic decisions, and for other discretionary purposes. We believe that these measures enhance the understanding of ongoing operations and comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they provide investors a view of the performance attributable to CaliberCos Inc. When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use these measures in addition to, and not as an alternative for, their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our presentation of non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly identified measures of other companies because not all companies use the same calculations. These measures may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments. \n\n_Asset Management Platform or Platform_\n\nPlatform refers to the performance of the Caliber asset management platform segment, which generates revenues and expenses from managing our investment portfolio, which does not include any consolidated assets or funds. These activities include asset management, transaction services, and performance allocations. Management believes that this is an important view of the Company because it communicates performance of the Company that would be most useful for understanding the value of CWD. \n\n_Fee-Related Earnings and Related Components_\n\nFee-Related Earnings is a supplemental non-GAAP performance measure used to assess our ability to generate profits from fee-based revenues, focusing on whether our core revenue streams are sufficient to cover our core operating expenses. Fee- Related Earnings represents the Company’s net income (loss) before income taxes adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, interest expense and extraordinary or non-recurring revenue and expenses, including performance allocation revenue and gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, public registration direct costs related to aborted or delayed offerings and our Reg A+ offering, the share repurchase costs related to the Company’s Buyback Program, litigation settlements, and expenses recorded to earnings relating to investment deals which were abandoned or closed. Fee-Related Earnings is presented on a basis that deconsolidates our consolidated funds (intercompany eliminations) and eliminates noncontrolling interest. Eliminating the impact of consolidated funds and noncontrolling interest provides investors a view of the performance attributable to CaliberCos Inc. and is consistent with performance models and analysis used by management. \n\n_Distributable Earnings_\n\nDistributable Earnings is a supplemental non-GAAP performance measure equal to Fee-Related Earnings plus performance allocation revenue and less interest expenses and provision for income taxes. We believe that Distributable Earnings can be useful as a supplemental performance measure to our GAAP results assessing the amount of earnings available for distribution. \n\n_Platform Earnings_\n\nPlatform Earningsrepresentsthe performance of the Caliber asset management platform segment, which generates revenues and expenses from managing our investment portfolio, excluding any consolidated assets or funds. \n\n_Platform Earnings per Share_\n\nPlatform Earnings per Share is calculated as Platform Earnings divided by weighted average CWD common shares outstanding. \n\n_Platform Adjusted EBITDA_\n\nPlatform Adjusted EBITDA represents the Company’s Distributable Earnings adjusted for interest expense, the share repurchase costs related to the Company’s Buyback Program, other income (expense), and provision for income taxes on a basis that deconsolidates our consolidated funds (intercompany eliminations), Loss on CRAF Investment Redemption, Gain on extinguishment of Payroll Protection Program loans, and eliminates noncontrolling interest. Eliminating the impact of consolidated funds and noncontrolling interest provides investors a view of the performance attributable to the CaliberCos Inc. Platform and is consistent with performance models and analysis used by management. \n\n_Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA_\n\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA represents the Company’s and the consolidated funds’ earnings before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, transaction fees, expenses and other public registration direct costs related to aborted or delayed offerings and our Reg A+ offering, the share repurchase costs related to the Company’s Buyback Program, litigation settlements, expenses recorded to earnings relating to investment deals which were abandoned or closed, any other non-cash expenses or losses, as further adjusted for extraordinary or non-recurring items. \n\n**NON-GAAP ADJUSTED EBITDA** **(AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS) (UNAUDITED)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n**Net****income (****loss) attributable to CaliberCos Inc.** |  $  | 146 |  $  |  (3,409  |  )   \nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests  |  (145  |  )  |  (8,813  |  )   \n**Net income (loss)** |  1  |  (12,222  |  )   \nProvision for income taxes  |  —  |  —   \n**Net income (loss) before income taxes** |  1  |  (12,222  |  )   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  145  |  140   \nConsolidated funds' impact on fee-related earnings  |  45  |  8,477   \nStock-based compensation  |  738  |  393   \nSeverance  |  25  |  6   \nPerformance allocations  |  (175  |  )  |  (36  |  )   \nOther expenses (income), net  |  (425  |  )  |  (414  |  )   \nInterest expense, net  |  1,289  |  587   \n**Fee-related earnings** |  1,643  |  (3,069  |  )   \nPerformance allocations  |  175  |  36   \nInterest expense, net  |  (1,289  |  )  |  (587  |  )   \nProvision for income taxes  |  —  |  —   \n**Distributable earnings** |  529  |  (3,620  |  )   \nInterest expense  |  1,349  |  1,316   \nOther expenses (income), net  |  425  |  414   \nProvision for income taxes  |  —  |  —   \nConsolidated funds' impact on Caliber adjusted EBITDA  |  109  |  379   \n**Platform adjusted EBITDA** |  2,412  |  (1,511  |  )   \nConsolidated funds' EBITDA adjustments  |  1,836  |  (1,646  |  )   \n**Consolidated adjusted EBITDA** |  $  |  4,248  |  $  |  (3,157  |  )   \n  \nView source version on businesswire.com: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241112815135/en/>\n\n_Caliber_ : Victoria Rotondo +1 480-295-7600 Victoria.Rotondo@caliberco.com\n\n_Investor Relations_ : Lisa Fortuna, Financial Profiles +1 310-622-8251 ir@caliberco.com\n\n_Media Relations_ : Kelly McAndrew, Financial Profiles +1 310-622-8239 KMcAndrew@finprofiles.com\n\nSource: Caliber\n\nReleased November 12, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/news/email-alerts)\n  * [Contacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://ir.caliberco.com/news/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n\n### Overview\n\n[ Overview ](/)\n\n### News\n\n  * [ Press Releases ](/news/press-releases)\n  * [ Email Alerts ](/news/email-alerts)\n  * [ Video ](/news/video)\n\n\n\n### Company Info\n\n  * [ Overview ](/company-information)\n  * [ Management Team ](/company-information/management-team)\n  * [ Presentations ](/company-information/presentations)\n  * [ IR Calendar ](/company-information/ir-calendar)\n  * [ Contacts ](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [ FAQ ](/company-information/faq)\n\n\n\n### Financial Info\n\n  * [ Overview ](/financial-information)\n  * [ Financial Results ](/financial-information/financial-results)\n  * [ Income Statement ](/financial-information/income-statement)\n  * [ Balance Sheet ](/financial-information/balance-sheet)\n  * [ Cash Flow ](/financial-information/cash-flow)\n\n\n\n### Stock Data\n\n  * [ Quote ](/stock-data/quote)\n  * [ Charts ](/stock-data/charts)\n  * [ Historical Data ](/stock-data/historical-data)\n  * [ Analyst Coverage ](/stock-data/analyst-coverage)\n\n\n\n### SEC Filings\n\n  * [ Overview ](/sec-filings)\n  * [ All SEC Filings ](/sec-filings/all-sec-filings)\n  * [ Annual Reports ](/sec-filings/annual-reports)\n  * [ Quarterly Reports ](/sec-filings/quarterly-reports)\n  * [ Section 16 Filings ](/sec-filings/section-16-filings)\n\n\n\n### Governance\n\n  * [ Overview ](/corporate-governance)\n  * [ Board of Directors ](/corporate-governance/board-of-directors)\n  * [ Board Committees ](/corporate-governance/board-committees)\n  * [ Governance Documents ](/corporate-governance/governance-documents)\n\n\n\nBy browsing this website you agree to our [cookie policy](https://www.caliberco.com/cookie-policy \"Opens in a new window\")\n\nAccept\n"

Platform refers to the performance of CWD itself, excluding the performance of certain assets & funds that are included in our consolidated results, as required by the United States generally accepted accounting standards (“GAAP”). Management believes that Platform performance offers the most meaningful information needed to understand the value of CWD. The assets and funds that are consolidated into our GAAP presentation are included because Caliber is a guarantor of debt held by these assets and funds. \n\nWhile GAAP consolidation rules require CWD to include the performance and cash flows of these assets & funds in our consolidated financial information, CWD does not benefit from the performance of those assets & funds, except to the extent that CWD earns fees from managing the assets and funds (which are included in the Platform results). Management believes presenting Platform results, which exclude consolidated assets, directly shows the business performance that CWD stockholders benefit from. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Platform Financial Highlights (compared to third quarter 2023)**\n\n  * Platform revenue of $7.4 million, a 98.9% increase \n    * Asset management revenue of $7.2 million drove the stated results \n    * Performance allocations of $0.2 million \n  * Platform earnings of $0.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to Platform loss of $3.4 million, or $0.16 per diluted share \n  * Platform Adjusted EBITDA of $2.4 million, a 259.6% increase compared to Platform Adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.5 million \n  * Fair value assets under management (“FV AUM”) of $807.0 million, an 8.9% increase compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to the acquisitions of our West Ridge property in Colorado and Canyon Corporate Plaza property in Arizona, net market appreciation, and construction activity; partially offset by land parcel sales at Johnstown, the sale of a school property, and the sale of a self-storage property \n  * Managed capital of $485.3 million, a 10.9% increase compared to December 31, 2023, with originations of $61.4 million, offset by redemptions of $13.8 million \n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n\"We delivered strong third quarter results with a 98.9% increase nearly doubling Platform revenue, primarily driven by higher fee income from loan placements and offerings,” said Chris Loeffler, CEO of Caliber. “This top-line growth, paired with the impact of our recent cost-reduction initiatives, has boosted our performance, resulting in positive Platform adjusted EBITDA and Platform earnings during the third quarter, ahead of our fourth-quarter 2024 target.” \n\n“While fundraising and commercial real estate remain volatile, for reasons I look forward to discussing on today’s call, our strategic and tactical progress towards consistent, profitable growth is clear.” \n\n**Business Update**\n\nThe following are key milestones completed both during and subsequent to the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n  * On July 2, 2024, Caliber announced the sale of 24-7 Automated Storage, a 348-unit self-storage facility in Casa Grande, Ariz., for $4.6 million. \n  * On October 1, 2024, Caliber announced the launch of its innovative new Qualified Opportunity Zone Fund Roll-Up program and completed its first merger with a third-party fund resulting in a $14 million increase in managed capital in Caliber’s existing qualified opportunity zone fund (“QOF”), the Caliber Tax Advantaged Opportunity Zone Fund, LP (CTAF I). \n  * On October 8, 2024, Caliber announced that it reached a definitive agreement with Satori Collective where Satori will contribute seven hotel properties to Caliber subsidiary Caliber Hospitality Trust (CHT), an externally advised private hospitality corporation. The contribution, when closed, is expected to increase assets under management (“AUM”) by approximately $120 million. \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Consolidated Financial Results (compared to third quarter 2023)**\n\nCaliber’s GAAP consolidated financial statements have been impacted by the deconsolidation of certain variable interest entities’ assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These entities were deconsolidated because Caliber was no longer a guarantor on the respective entities’ third party debt. Caliber’s GAAP financial metrics are impacted by the timing of deconsolidation. As such, prior periods presented may not be comparable due to the deconsolidation of certain entities in the current period. \n\n  * Total consolidated revenue of $11.3 million, a 33.6% decrease reflecting the deconsolidation of Caliber Hospitality, LP and CHT, in March 2024. Caliber estimates total revenue would have increased had the deconsolidated asset results not been included in the Q3 2023 comparison period. \n  * Consolidated net income attributable to Caliber of $0.1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to net loss attributable to Caliber of $3.4 million or $0.16 per diluted share \n  * Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $4.2 million, compared to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA loss of $3.2 million. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nCaliber will host a conference call today, Tuesday, November 12, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results and business outlook. To access this call, dial 1-800-717-1738 (domestic) or 1-646-307-1865 (international). A live webcast of the conference call will be available via the investor relations section of Caliber’s website under “Financial Results.” The webcast replay of the conference call will be available on Caliber’s website shortly after the call concludes. \n\n**About Caliber (CaliberCos Inc.) (NASDAQ: CWD)**\n\nWith more than $2.9 billion of managed assets, including estimated costs to complete assets under development, Caliber’s 15-year track record of managing and developing real estate is built on a singular goal: make money in all market conditions.

Management believes that the Platform view of Caliber’s performance is more meaningful to a CWD shareholder since it includes all revenues and expenses generated by Caliber and its wholly owned subsidiaries. \n\n**ASSET MANAGEMENT PLATFORM SEGMENT(1)** **(AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS) (UNAUDITED)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**  \n**Platform** |  **Impact of Consolidated Fund

As a result of these guarantor commitments, Caliber is required under GAAP to include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of those entities even though a shareholder of CWD stock is neither entitled to nor exposed by those entities’ benefits or obligations. This accounting outcome also removes revenues that we earn from those entities, which a shareholder of CWD stock would be entitled to. See discussion elsewhere related to CWD’s Platform performance. \n\n**CALIBERCOS INC.

We monitor two types of information with regard to our AUM: \n\n  1. Managed Capital – we define this as the total capital we fundraise from our customers as investments in our funds. It also includes fundraising into our corporate note program, the proceeds of which were used, in part, to invest in or loan to our funds. We use this information to monitor, among other things, the amount of ‘preferred return’ that would be paid at the time of a distribution and the potential to earn a performance fee over and above the preferred return at the time of the distribution. Our fund management fees are based on a percentage of managed capital or a percentage of assets under management, and monitoring the change and composition of managed capital provides relevant data points for Caliber management to further calculate and predict future earnings. \n  2. Fair Value (“FV”) AUM – we define this as the aggregate fair value of the real estate assets we manage and from which we derive management fees, performance revenues and other fees and expense reimbursements. We estimate the value of these assets quarterly to help make sale and hold decisions and to evaluate whether an existing asset would benefit from refinancing or recapitalization. This also gives us insight into the value of our carried interest at any point in time. We also utilize FV AUM to predict the percentage of our portfolio which may need development services in a given year, fund management services (such as refinance), and brokerage services. As we control the decision to hire for these services, our service income is generally predictable based upon our current portfolio AUM and our expectations for AUM growth in the year forecasted. \n\n\n\n**Non-GAAP Measures**\n\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, make strategic decisions, and for other discretionary purposes. We believe that these measures enhance the understanding of ongoing operations and comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they provide investors a view of the performance attributable to CaliberCos Inc. When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use these measures in addition to, and not as an alternative for, their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our presentation of non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly identified measures of other companies because not all companies use the same calculations. These measures may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments. \n\n_Asset Management Platform or Platform_\n\nPlatform refers to the performance of the Caliber asset management platform segment, which generates revenues and expenses from managing our investment portfolio, which does not include any consolidated assets or funds. These activities include asset management, transaction services, and performance allocations. Management believes that this is an important view of the Company because it communicates performance of the Company that would be most useful for understanding the value of CWD. \n\n_Fee-Related Earnings and Related Components_\n\nFee-Related Earnings is a supplemental non-GAAP performance measure used to assess our ability to generate profits from fee-based revenues, focusing on whether our core revenue streams are sufficient to cover our core operating expenses. Fee- Related Earnings represents the Company’s net income (loss) before income taxes adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, interest expense and extraordinary or non-recurring revenue and expenses, including performance allocation revenue and gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, public registration direct costs related to aborted or delayed offerings and our Reg A+ offering, the share repurchase costs related to the Company’s Buyback Program, litigation settlements, and expenses recorded to earnings relating to investment deals which were abandoned or closed. Fee-Related Earnings is presented on a basis that deconsolidates our consolidated funds (intercompany eliminations) and eliminates noncontrolling interest. Eliminating the impact of consolidated funds and noncontrolling interest provides investors a view of the performance attributable to CaliberCos Inc. and is consistent with performance models and analysis used by management. \n\n_Distributable Earnings_\n\nDistributable Earnings is a supplemental non-GAAP performance measure equal to Fee-Related Earnings plus performance allocation revenue and less interest expenses and provision for income taxes. We believe that Distributable Earnings can be useful as a supplemental performance measure to our GAAP results assessing the amount of earnings available for distribution. \n\n_Platform Earnings_\n\nPlatform Earningsrepresentsthe performance of the Caliber asset management platform segment, which generates revenues and expenses from managing our investment portfolio, excluding any consolidated assets or funds. \n\n_Platform Earnings per Share_\n\nPlatform Earnings per Share is calculated as Platform Earnings divided by weighted average CWD common shares outstanding. \n\n_Platform Adjusted EBITDA_\n\nPlatform Adjusted EBITDA represents the Company’s Distributable Earnings adjusted for interest expense, the share repurchase costs related to the Company’s Buyback Program, other income (expense), and provision for income taxes on a basis that deconsolidates our consolidated funds (intercompany eliminations), Loss on CRAF Investment Redemption, Gain on extinguishment of Payroll Protection Program loans, and eliminates noncontrolling interest. Eliminating the impact of consolidated funds and noncontrolling interest provides investors a view of the performance attributable to the CaliberCos Inc. Platform and is consistent with performance models and analysis used by management. \n\n_Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA_\n\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA represents the Company’s and the consolidated funds’ earnings before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, transaction fees, expenses and other public registration direct costs related to aborted or delayed offerings and our Reg A+ offering, the share repurchase costs related to the Company’s Buyback Program, litigation settlements, expenses recorded to earnings relating to investment deals which were abandoned or closed, any other non-cash expenses or losses, as further adjusted for extraordinary or non-recurring items. \n\n**NON-GAAP ADJUSTED EBITDA** **(AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS) (UNAUDITED)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n**Net****income (****loss) attributable to CaliberCos Inc.** |  $  | 146 |  $  |  (3,409  |  )   \nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests  |  (145  |  )  |  (8,813  |  )   \n**Net income (loss)** |  1  |  (12,222  |  )   \nProvision for income taxes  |  —  |  —   \n**Net income (loss) before income taxes** |  1  |  (12,222  |  )   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  145  |  140   \nConsolidated funds' impact on fee-related earnings  |  45  |  8,477   \nStock-based compensation  |  738  |  393   \nSeverance  |  25  |  6   \nPerformance allocations  |  (175  |  )  |  (36  |  )   \nOther expenses (income), net  |  (425  |  )  |  (414  |  )   \nInterest expense, net  |  1,289  |  587   \n**Fee-related earnings** |  1,643  |  (3,069  |  )   \nPerformance allocations  |  175  |  36   \nInterest expense, net  |  (1,289  |  )  |  (587  |  )   \nProvision for income taxes  |  —  |  —   \n**Distributable earnings** |  529  |  (3,620  |  )   \nInterest expense  |  1,349  |  1,316   \nOther expenses (income), net  |  425  |  414   \nProvision for income taxes  |  —  |  —   \nConsolidated funds' impact on Caliber adjusted EBITDA  |  109  |  379   \n**Platform adjusted EBITDA** |  2,412  |  (1,511  |  )   \nConsolidated funds' EBITDA adjustments  |  1,836  |  (1,646  |  )   \n**Consolidated adjusted EBITDA** |  $  |  4,248  |  $  |  (3,157  |  )   \n  \nView source version on businesswire.com: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241112815135/en/>\n\n_Caliber_ : Victoria Rotondo +1 480-295-7600 Victoria.Rotondo@caliberco.com\n\n_Investor Relations_ : Lisa Fortuna, Financial Profiles +1 310-622-8251 ir@caliberco.com\n\n_Media Relations_ : Kelly McAndrew, Financial Profiles +1 310-622-8239 KMcAndrew@finprofiles.com\n\nSource: Caliber\n\nReleased November 12, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/news/email-alerts)\n  * [Contacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://ir.caliberco.com/news/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n\n### Overview\n\n[ Overview ](/)\n\n### News\n\n  * [ Press Releases ](/news/press-releases)\n  * [ Email Alerts ](/news/email-alerts)\n  * [ Video ](/news/video)\n\n\n\n### Company Info\n\n  * [ Overview ](/company-information)\n  * [ Management Team ](/company-information/management-team)\n  * [ Presentations ](/company-information/presentations)\n  * [ IR Calendar ](/company-information/ir-calendar)\n  * [ Contacts ](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [ FAQ ](/company-information/faq)\n\n\n\n### Financial Info\n\n  * [ Overview ](/financial-information)\n  * [ Financial Results ](/financial-information/financial-results)\n  * [ Income Statement ](/financial-information/income-statement)\n  * [ Balance Sheet ](/financial-information/balance-sheet)\n  * [ Cash Flow ](/financial-information/cash-flow)\n\n\n\n### Stock Data\n\n  * [ Quote ](/stock-data/quote)\n  * [ Charts ](/stock-data/charts)\n  * [ Historical Data ](/stock-data/historical-data)\n  * [ Analyst Coverage ](/stock-data/analyst-coverage)\n\n\n\n### SEC Filings\n\n  * [ Overview ](/sec-filings)\n  * [ All SEC Filings ](/sec-filings/all-sec-filings)\n  * [ Annual Reports ](/sec-filings/annual-reports)\n  * [ Quarterly Reports ](/sec-filings/quarterly-reports)\n  * [ Section 16 Filings ](/sec-filings/section-16-filings)\n\n\n\n### Governance\n\n  * [ Overview ](/corporate-governance)\n  * [ Board of Directors ](/corporate-governance/board-of-directors)\n  * [ Board Committees ](/corporate-governance/board-committees)\n  * [ Governance Documents ](/corporate-governance/governance-documents)\n\n\n\nBy browsing this website you agree to our [cookie policy](https://www.caliberco.com/cookie-policy \"Opens in a new window\")\n\nAccept\n"

When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use these\nmeasures in addition to, and not as an alternative for, their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our presentation of non-\nGAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly identified measures of other companies because not all companies use the same calculations. These measures may also differ from\nthe amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which amounts are further adjusted to reflectcertain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us\nto determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.\nAsset Management Platform or Platform\nPlatform refers to the performance of the Caliber asset management platform segment, which generates revenues and expenses from managing our investment portfolio, which does not\ninclude any consolidated assets or funds. These activities include asset management, transaction services, and performance allocations. Management believes that this is an important\nview of the Company because it communicates performance of the Company that would be most useful for understanding the value of CWD.\nFee-Related Earnings and Related Components\nFee-RelatedEarnings is a supplemental non-GAAP performance measure used to assess our ability to generate profitsfrom fee-based revenues, focusingon whether our core revenue\nstreams, are sufficient to cover our core operating expenses. Fee-Related Earnings represents the Company’s net income (loss) before income taxes adjusted to exclude depreciation\nand amortization, stock-based compensation, interest expense and extraordinary or non-recurring revenue and expenses, including performance allocation revenue and gain (loss) on\nextinguishment of debt, public registration direct costs related to aborted or delayed offerings and our Reg A+ offering, the share repurchase costs related to the Company’s Buyback\nProgram, litigation settlements, and expenses recorded to earnings relating to investment deals which were abandoned or closed. Fee-Related Earnings is presented on a basis\nthat deconsolidates our consolidated funds (intercompany eliminations) and eliminates noncontrolling interest. Eliminating the impact of consolidated funds and noncontrolling interest\nprovides investors aviewoftheperformanceattributabletoCaliberCosInc.and is consistentwithperformancemodelsand analysisusedby management.\nDistributable Earnings\nDistributable Earnings is a supplemental non-GAAP performance measure equal to Fee-Related Earnings plus performance allocation revenue and less interest expenses and provision\nfor income taxes. We believe that Distributable Earnings can be useful as a supplemental performance measure to our GAAP results assessing the amount of earnings available for\ndistribution.\nT H E W E A L T H D E V E L O P M E N T C O M P A N Y 33\nNON-GAAP Measures\nPlatform Earnings\nPlatform Earnings represents the performance of the Caliber asset management platform segment, which generates revenues and expenses from managing our investment portfolio,\nexcluding any consolidated assets or funds.\nPlatform Earnings per Share\nPlatform Earnings per Share is calculated as Platform Earnings divided by weighted average CWD common shares outstanding.\nPlatform Adjusted EBITDA\nPlatform Adjusted EBITDArepresentsthe Company’sDistributableEarningsadjusted for interest expense,the sharerepurchase costsrelatedto the Company’s Buyback Program, other\nincome (expense), and provision for income taxes on a basis that deconsolidates our consolidated funds (intercompany eliminations), Loss on CRAF Investment Redemption, Gain on\nextinguishment of Payroll Protection Program loans, and eliminates noncontrolling interest. Eliminating the impact of consolidated funds and noncontrolling interest provides investors a\nviewoftheperformanceattributable toCaliberCosInc.and is consistentwithperformancemodelsand analysisusedby management.\nConsolidatedAdjustedEBITDA\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA represents the Company’s and the consolidated funds’ earnings before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, further\nadjusted to excludestock-based compensation, transaction fees, expenses and other public registration direct costs relatedto aborted or delayed offerings and our Reg A+ offering, the\nsharerepurchase costs relatedto the Company’s Buyback Program, litigationsettlements, expensesrecordedto earnings relating to investmentdeals whichwereabandoned or closed,\nany othernon-cashexpensesor losses,as further adjusted for extraordinary or non-recurringitems.\nThe following tables presents a reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to CaliberCos Inc. to Fee-Related Earnings, Distributable Earnings, Caliber Adjusted EBITDA, and\nConsolidatedAdjustedEBITDAfor thequarters endedSeptember30,2024,and 2023(in thousands):\nT H E W E A L T H D E V E L O P M E N T C O M P A N Y 34\nNON-GAAP Reconciliations\nT H E W E A L T H D E V E L O P M E N T C O M P A N Y 35\nNON-GAAP Reconciliations (cont.)\nT H E W E A L T H D E V E L O P M E N T C O M P A N Y 36\nNON-GAAP Reconciliations (cont.)\nT H E W E A L T H D E V E L O P M E N T C O M P A N Y 37\nNON-GAAP Reconciliations (cont.)\nASSET MANAGEMENT PLATFORM SEGMENT(1)\n(AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS) (UNAUDITED)\nPLATFORM REVENUE(1)\n(AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS) (UNAUDITED)\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\n2024 2023\nFund set-up fees $ 831 $ 398\nFund management fees 2,744 2,457\nFinancing fees 464 154\nDevelopment and construction fees 3,084 516\nBrokerage fees 119 179\nTotal asset management 7,242 3,704\nPerformance allocations 174 24\nTotal revenue $ 7,416 $ 3,728\n___________________________________________\n(1) Represents the results of our asset management platform segment, which are presented on a basis that deconsolidates our consolidated funds\n(intercompany eliminations) and eliminate noncontrolling interest.\nT H E W E A L T H D E V E L O P M E N T C O M P A N Y 38\nNON-GAAP Reconciliations (cont.)\nMANAGED CAPITAL\n(AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS) (UNAUDITED)\nManaged Capital\nBalances as of December 31, 2023 $ 437,625\nOriginations 19,099\nRedemptions (2,819)\nBalances as of March 31, 2024 453,905\nOriginations 18,936\nRedemptions (3,041)\nBalances as of June 30, 2024 469,800\nOriginations 23,372\nRedemptions (7,900)\nBalances as of September 30, 2024 $ 485,272\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nReal Estate\nHospitality $ 47,560 $ 43,660\nCaliber Hospitality Trust(1) 96,879 70,747\nResidential 92,683 74,224\nCommercial 167,989 155,004\nTotal Real Estate(2) 405,111 343,635\nCredit(3) 70,541 84,588\nOther(4) 9,620 9,402\nTotal $ 485,272 $ 437,625\n_________________________________________\n(1) The Company earns a fund management fee of 0.70% of the Caliber Hospitality Trust’s enterprise value and is reimbursed for certain costs incurred\non behalf of the Caliber Hospitality Trust.\n(2) Beginning during the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company includes capital raised from investors in CaliberCos Inc. through corporate note\nissuances that was further invested in our funds in Managed Capital.
