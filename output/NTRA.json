This coverage applies to SLT patients in the surveillance setting. \n\nSLT patients make up ~20% of all U.S. lung transplants 1 . These patients are at an increased risk for acute rejection and also for complications from invasive procedures like biopsies due to common factors including advanced age, frailty, comorbidities, and functional dependency on a single lung. This creates an increased need for non-invasive monitoring solutions, like Prospera Lung. \n\nThe performance of Prospera Lung for SLT patients was published earlier this year from the Single Lung Allograft Monitoring (a.k.a. SLAM) study, the largest study of commercial donor-derived cell free DNA (dd-cfDNA) tests in SLT to-date. The data demonstrated excellent performance for Prospera in distinguishing rejection, infection, and chronic lung allograft disease (CLAD) from stable patients with an AUC-ROC of 0.85. These results are on par with Prospera’s outstanding performance in double-lung transplants, and can ultimately provide confidence to rule out rejection, highlighted by a sensitivity of 77.8%, specificity of 84.6%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 96.8%. \n\n“We are pleased to be the first and only dd-cfDNA test validated and approved by CMS for SLT patients,” said David Ross, MD, senior medical director for lung transplant at Natera. “Lung transplant survival is among the worst compared to other organs, even more so for SLT patients where the median survival is just 4.7 years post-transplant and with higher risk for both acute and chronic rejection. It is critical to patient care that SLT patients have the option for non-invasive monitoring to avoid biopsy complications in these challenging cases.” \n\nSince the initial validation and launch in 2022, the Prospera Lung test first received CMS coverage for double-lung transplant patients in 2023 and is now used by more than half of lung transplant centers in the United States. \n\n**About Prospera**\n\nThe [Prospera](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3503937-1%26h%3D4084705604%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fc212.net%252Fc%252Flink%252F%253Ft%253D0%2526l%253Den%2526o%253D3345471-1%2526h%253D3703581015%2526u%253Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fc212.net%25252Fc%25252Flink%25252F%25253Ft%25253D0%252526l%25253Den%252526o%25253D3275317-1%252526h%25253D3653399993%252526u%25253Dhttps%2525253A%2525252F%2525252Fc212.net%2525252Fc%2525252Flink%2525252F%2525253Ft%2525253D0%25252526l%2525253Den%25252526o%2525253D3186138-1%25252526h%2525253D2206992313%25252526u%2525253Dhttps%252525253A%252525252F%252525252Fc212.net%252525252Fc%252525252Flink%252525252F%252525253Ft%252525253D0%2525252526l%252525253Den%2525252526o%252525253D2915665-1%2525252526h%252525253D173193744%2525252526u%252525253Dhttps%25252525253A%25252525252F%25252525252Fc212.net%25252525252Fc%25252525252Flink%25252525252F%25252525253Ft%25252525253D0%252525252526l%25252525253Den%252525252526o%25252525253D2676832-1%252525252526h%25252525253D1459754544%252525252526u%25252525253Dhttps%2525252525253A%2525252525252F%2525252525252Fwww.natera.com%2525252525252Fprospera%252525252526a%25252525253D%252525252525C2%252525252525A0Prospera%2525252526a%252525253DProspera%25252526a%2525253DProspera%252526a%25253DProspera%2526a%253DProspera%26a%3DProspera&esheet=54158763&newsitemid=20241127854263&lan=en-US&anchor=Prospera&index=2&md5=2655ae181f421fadc328892695d3932e) ™ test leverages Natera’s core single-nucleotide (SNP)-based massively multiplexed PCR (mmPCR) technology to identify allograft rejection non-invasively and with high precision and accuracy, without the need for prior donor or recipient genotyping. The test works by measuring the fraction of donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) in the recipient’s blood. It may be used by physicians considering the diagnosis of active rejection, helping to rule in or out this condition when evaluating the need for diagnostic testing or the results of an invasive biopsy. The Prospera test has been clinically and analytically validated for performance regardless of donor relatedness, rejection type, and clinical presentation. \n\n**About Natera**\n\nNatera™ is a global leader in cell-free DNA and genetic testing, dedicated to oncology, women’s health, and organ health.

Natera and its collaborators will present a total of six abstracts. \n\n“We are proud to share this new data on Signatera at SABCS that underscores our commitment to generating evidence on the clinical utility of Signatera for patients with breast cancer,” said Angel Rodriguez, M.D., senior medical director at Natera. \n\nThe full list of abstracts with selected highlights are as follows: \n\nZEST Clinical Trial  **Oral Presentation #GS3-01 | Dec. 13 | Presenter: Nicholas Turner, MD, PhD, FRCP, FMedSci** _Circulating tumor DNA surveillance in ZEST, a randomized, phase 3, double-blind study of niraparib or placebo in patients with triple-negative breast cancer or HR+ HER2− BRCA-mutated breast cancer with molecular residual disease after definitive therapy_\n\nZEST was a randomized, phase III, double-blind trial, sponsored by GSK, that evaluated whether niraparib can enhance disease-free survival in patients with breast cancer who are ctDNA-positive after completion of curative intent therapy and without evidence of radiographic recurrence. A total of 2,746 patients were pre-screened. Of patients who were ctDNA-positive, 40 were enrolled and randomized (niraparib, 18; placebo, 22); 36 patients (90%) had Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC), and 4 patients (10%) had BRCA-mutated HR+ disease. An analysis of outcomes among randomized patients showed a median disease-free survival of 11.4 months in the niraparib arm versus 5.4 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.30–1.39). \n\nClinical Genomics Database Experience  **Poster Spotlight #PS9-01 | Dec. 12 | Presenter: Marla Lipsyc-Sharf, MD** _Actionable Genomic Alterations in Localized Hormone Receptor Positive (HR+) Breast Cancer and Impact on Clinical Outcomes: Results from Comprehensive Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) and Tumor-Informed circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis_\n\nThis real-world analysis evaluated the association of targetable tumor genomic alterations with ctDNA detection and distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) in early-stage breast cancer. In the study, 44% of patients (127/287) who were Signatera-positive had at least one targetable genomic alternation, including 34.5% with the _PIK3CA_ mutation. In addition, of patients with ctDNA-positivity within 2 years, those with mutated _PIK3CA_ had an inferior DRFS (HR: 36.9), compared to patients with wild-type _PIK3CA_ (HR=16.3). \n\nPatient-Reported Outcomes  Four abstracts to be presented at SABCS evaluated patient reported outcomes when testing for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). The data indicates that ctDNA testing can provide valuable information for treatment planning while not causing increased anxiety in patients. \n\n**Poster #P2-03-21 | Dec. 11 | Presenter: Neil Carleton** _Longitudinal Monitoring of ctDNA to Facilitate Surgical De-Escalation and Disease Surveillance in Older Women with ER+ Breast Cancer on Primary Endocrine Therapy: A Prospective, Pragmatic, Hybrid-Decentralized Trial with Correlative Analyses_\n\n**Poster #P4-03-29 | Dec. 12 | Presenter: Devora Isseroff, MD** _Patient (Pt) reported anxiety levels during ctDNA surveillance in early-stage triple negative (TNBC) and hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer (BC)_\n\n**Poster #P3-01-22 | Dec. 12 | Presenter: Mrinalini Ramesh, DO** Pilot feasibility study of ctDNA testing in breast cancer and its association with pain, stress and anxiety \n\n**Poster #P5-12-19 | Dec. 13 | Presenter: Mridula George, MD** _Patient-reported outcomes from the CIPHER study_\n\n**About Signatera** [Signatera](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3732835-1%26h%3D1685092079%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.natera.com%252Foncology%252Fsignatera-advanced-cancer-detection%252F%26a%3DSignatera&esheet=54157319&newsitemid=20241125653673&lan=en-US&anchor=Signatera&index=4&md5=e5d7817c68a671c8348fd72b54a93339) is a personalized, tumor-informed, molecular residual disease test for patients previously diagnosed with cancer.

Today, a jury issued a decision in Guardant’s favor. We disagree with this decision and will ask the Court to overturn it._\n\n_The jury was asked to evaluate comparative advertisements that ran for a brief period in 2021 related to the performance of Guardant’s Reveal test. This case had nothing to do with the validity or utility of Signatera, and certain key pieces of evidence supporting Natera’s case were not included in this trial._\n\n_Although Guardant has blamed Natera’s advertisements from three years ago for Reveal’s performance in the market, we believe Oncologists make their decisions based on the published evidence and their own experience with the tests._\n\n_In the years that have passed since these events, Signatera has become the most widely used MRD test in the U.S., extensively validated with published evidence in more than 100 peer-reviewed papers across multiple cancer types and indications._\n\n**About Signatera**\n\nSignatera is a personalized, tumor-informed, molecular residual disease test for patients previously diagnosed with cancer.

(NASDAQ: NTRA), a global leader in cell-free DNA and genetic testing, today reported its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Recent Strategic and Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Generated total revenues of $439.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $268.3 million in the third quarter of 2023, a record increase of 63.9%. Product revenues grew 64.4% over the same period. \n  * Generated a gross margin of 61.8% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to a gross margin of 45.1% in the third quarter of 2023. \n  * Processed approximately 775,800 tests in the third quarter of 2024, compared to approximately 626,000 tests in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 23.9%. \n  * Performed approximately 137,100 oncology tests in the third quarter of 2024, compared to approximately 88,800 in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 54.4%. \n  * Achieved positive cash flow of approximately $34.5 million 1 in the third quarter of 2024. \n  * Raising annual guidance and now expecting 2024 total revenue of $1.61 billion to $1.64 billion, gross margin of 58% to 61%, and $50 million to $75 million in net cash inflow. \n  * Announced completion of study using Signatera TM from the CALGB (Alliance)/SWOG 80702 randomized, phase III clinical trial in colorectal cancer. \n  * Published first-of-its-kind colorectal cancer data from the GALAXY study in Nature Medicine and concurrently presented the data at the 2024 Congress of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO). \n\n\n\n“Our strong performance in the third quarter reflects our unwavering dedication to the patients we serve and the passion of our employees in each of our business areas,” said Steve Chapman, chief executive officer of Natera. “We grew volumes, revenue, gross margin, and cash flow in what continues to be a transformational year for Natera.” \n\n**Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Financial Results**\n\nTotal revenues were $439.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $268.3 million in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 63.9%. The increase in total revenues was driven primarily by a 64.4% increase in product revenues, which were $436.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $265.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in product revenues was primarily driven by an increase in volume, average selling price improvements, as well as cash receipts that were collected during the quarter related to tests delivered in prior quarters that were fully collected. \n\nNatera processed approximately 775,800 tests in the third quarter of 2024, including approximately 760,700 tests accessioned in its laboratory, compared to approximately 626,000 tests processed, including approximately 609,800 tests accessioned in its laboratory, in the third quarter of 2023. \n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Natera recognized revenue on approximately 750,100 tests for which results were reported to customers in the period (tests reported), including approximately 735,900 tests reported from its laboratory, compared to approximately 590,000 tests reported, including approximately 575,000 tests reported from its laboratory, in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 27.1% from the prior period. \n\nGross profit 2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $271.7 million and $121.0 million, respectively, representing a gross margin of 61.8% and 45.1%, respectively. Natera had higher gross margin in the third quarter of 2024 primarily as a result of higher revenues, continued progress in reducing cost of revenues associated with tests processed, as well as incremental cash receipts during the quarter associated with tests delivered in prior periods that were fully collected. Total operating expenses, representing research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, for the third quarter of 2024 were $311.1 million, compared to $232.0 million in the same period of the prior year, an increase of 34.0%. The increase was primarily driven by headcount growth to support new product offerings as well as increases in consulting and legal expenses. \n\nLoss from operations for the third quarter of 2024 was $39.3 million compared to $111.0 million for the same period of the prior year. Natera reported a net loss for the third quarter of 2024 of $31.6 million, or ($0.26) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $109.0 million, or ($0.95) per diluted share, for the same period in 2023. Weighted average shares outstanding were approximately 123.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 115.2 million in the third quarter of the prior year. \n\nAt September 30, 2024, Natera held approximately $922.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash, compared to $879.0 million as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, Natera had a total outstanding debt balance of $367.0 million, comprised of $80.4 million including accrued interest under its line of credit with UBS at a variable interest rate of 30-day SOFR plus 50 bps and a net carrying amount of $286.6 million under its seven-year convertible senior notes issued in April 2020. The gross principal balance outstanding for the convertible senior notes was $287.5 million as of September 30, 2024. All outstanding convertible senior notes were redeemed or converted on October 11, 2024. \n\n**Financial Outlook**\n\nNatera anticipates 2024 total revenue of $1.61 billion to $1.64 billion; 2024 gross margin to be approximately 58% to 61% of revenues; selling, general and administrative costs to be approximately $775 million to $825 million; research and development costs to be $375 million to $400 million; and net cash inflow to be $50 million to $75 million 3 . \n\n**Test Volume Summary**  \n---  \n**Unit** |  **Q3 2024** |  **Q3 2023** |  **Definition**  \nTests processed  |  775,800  |  626,000  |  Tests accessioned in our laboratory plus units processed outside of our laboratory   \nTests accessioned  |  760,700  |  609,800  |  Test accessioned in our laboratory   \nTests reported  |  750,100  |  590,000  |  Total tests reported   \nTests reported in our laboratory  |  735,900  |  575,000  |  Total tests reported in our laboratory less units reported outside of our laboratory   \n  \n**About Natera**\n\nNatera™ is a global leader in cell-free DNA and genetic testing, dedicated to oncology, women’s health, and organ health.
