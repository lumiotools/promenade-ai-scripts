          "content": "Nayax Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nTotal revenue of $83 million, up 38% YoY;\nReporting positive Net Income for the first time of $0.7 million;\nRecord Adjusted EBITDA of $11.1 million (1);\nRevises 2024 revenue outlook to $315-320 million, represents 35% growth at mid-point;\nMaintains 2024 adjusted EBITDA(2) guidance of $30-35 million and positive FCF;\nHERZLIYA, Israel, November 12, 2024 – Nayax Ltd. (Nasdaq: NYAX, TASE: NYAX), a global\ncommerce payments and loyalty platform designed to help merchants scale their business, today\nannounced its financial results for the third quarter, ended September 30, 2024.\n“This quarter’s results showcase our continued momentum and success, driven by our focus on\nprofitable growth. We’re excited to report record revenue, a net profit for the quarter, positive free\ncash flow, and a growing base of customers as well as our managed and connected devices. This\nquarter marks an exciting inflection point for Nayax, with key milestones that reflect the hard work\nand dedication of our global team. We saw strong momentum across our business, with record\nrevenue of $83 million, a 38% year-over-year increase, and 49% year-over-year growth in\nrecurring revenues. Our focus on automation and efficiency is clearly paying off, enabling us to\ngrow profitably into the foreseeable future. With a growing customer base of approximately 91,000\nand an expanded global reach through key partnerships, we’re confident in our ability to keep\ndelivering value to customers and shareholders. We look forward to building on this success as\nwe enter our next phase of profitable growth,\" commented Yair Nechmad, Chief Executive Officer\nand Chairman of the Board.\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure. Please refer to the tables at the end of this news release for a reconciliation of\nadjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable IFRS measure.\n(2) The Company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking adjusted EBITDA to IFRS net income (loss) due to the inherent\ndifficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation, in particular, because special items\nsuch as finance expenses and Issuance and acquisition costs used to calculate projected net income (loss) vary dramatically based\non actual events. Therefore, the Company is not able to forecast on an IFRS basis with reasonable certainty all deductions needed in\norder to provide an IFRS calculation of projected net income (loss) at this time. The amount of these deductions may be material, and\ntherefore could result in projected IFRS net income (loss) being materially less than projected adjusted EBITDA (non-IFRS).\n1\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights\n(All comparisons are relative to the Third quarter and three-month period ended September 30,\n2023, unless otherwise stated)\nRevenue Breakdown\nQ3 2024 ($M) Q3 2023 ($M) Growth (%)\nSummary\nSaaS revenue 23.9 15.2 57%\nPayment processing fees 36.0 25.0 44%\nTotal recurring revenue (*) 59.9 40.2 49%\nPOS devices revenue (**) 23.1 20.1 15%\nTotal revenue (***) 83.0 60.3 38%\n(*) Recurring revenue comprised of SaaS subscription revenue and payment processing fees.\n(**) POS devices revenue includes revenues that are derived mainly from the sale of our hardware products.\n(***) Q3 2024 includes $8.7 million of revenues from recent acquisitions of VMtecnologia, Roseman, and Retail Pro.\n• Revenue of $83.0 million, up 38%, driven by both new and existing customer expansion.\n• Recurring revenue from SaaS and processing fees grew 49%, demonstrating the strength\nand resilience of our business model.

This partnership introduces the world’s first global\nomnichannel payment service provider solution for EV charging, integrating Nayax’s\npayment and loyalty platform into Adyen’s international platform. Additionally, this global\npartnership enables Nayax to expand into new regions, such as Latin America and APAC,\nwhile reducing operational costs.\n• Announced a strategic partnership with A2Z Cust2Mate Solutions Corp. to integrate\nNayax’s automated self-service mobile payment system with A2Z Cust2Mate’s cart\nplatform for smart retail stores. This collaboration enables customers to complete their\nshopping journey directly from their smart cart, eliminating the need for checkout lines, with\na seamless “pick-and-go” experience.\n3\n• Launched the Nayax Energy EV Kiosk, a payment processing solution for electric vehicle\n(EV) charging stations. This kiosk allows drivers to have a seamless and fast payment\nexperience while charging their vehicles using credit cards, debit cards, or mobile wallets\nwithout needing individual payment devices on each charger. It is part of Nayax Energy’s\nbroader offerings for various locations, such as parking garages, gas stations, and\nshopping centers.\nFinancial Outlook\nManagement is modifying revenue guidance to a range of $315 million to $320 million dollars,\nreflecting 35% growth at the midpoint, on a constant currency basis. This reduction is largely due\nto the timing of some new product certifications, which we now expect to be completed by the end\nof 2024 and beginning of 2025. This is a slight adjustment from our prior guidance of $325 million\nto $335 million dollars.\nWe expect continued improvement in hardware gross margins this year, driven by economies of\nscale, optimized pricing, and cost efficiencies. As a result, management is again raising our\nhardware margin guidance to exceed 30%, up from the previous range of 27% to 29%.\nWe reiterate our guidance for adjusted EBITDA, which remains strong at a range of $30 million\nto $35 million dollars for 2024, expected to be at the higher end of the range, underscoring our\nstrong operational performance.\nThe company also reaffirms that free cash flow for the full year 2024, defined as operating cash\nflow less capital expenditures, will remain positive, as demonstrated this quarter.\nWhile we are still in the planning process for next year, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be at least\n15% for 2025 driven by continued market expansion, the full integration of recent acquisitions,\ncontinuous operational optimization, and the resolution of some product certification delays,\nunlocking associated revenue.\nOn a long-term basis, management continues to target annual revenue growth of approximately\n35%, driven by a combination of organic growth and strategic M&A. Management also continues\nto target a gross margin of 50%, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 30%.\nIt is noted that the financial outlook provided by Nayax constitutes forward-looking information\nwithin the meaning of applicable securities laws and is based on a number of assumptions and\nsubject to a number of risks and is current as of today.

Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to\nupdate publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason, to conform these statements to\nactual results or to changes in our expectations.\n6\nUse of Non-IFRS Financial Information\nIn addition to various operational metrics and financial measures in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted under International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, this\npress release contains Adjusted EBITDA, a non-IFRS financial measure, as a measure to\nevaluate our past results and future prospects.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure that we define as profit or loss for the period\nplus finance expenses, tax expense, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation\ncosts, non-recurring issuance and acquisition related costs and our share in losses of associates\naccounted for by the equity method.\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA in this press release because it is a measure that our management\nand board of directors utilize as a measure to evaluate our operating performance and for internal\nplanning and forecasting purposes. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides\nuseful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results\nin the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA, when taken collectively with financial measures prepared in\naccordance with IFRS, may be helpful to investors because it provides an additional tool for\ninvestors to use in evaluating our ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our\nfinancial results with other companies because it provides consistency and comparability with\npast financial performance. However, our management does not consider this non-IFRS measure\nin isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with IFRS.\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as\nan analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial\ninformation presented in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted EBITDA may be different from similarly\ntitled measures used by other companies. The principal limitation of Adjusted EBITDA is that it\nexcludes significant expenses that are required by IFRS to be recorded in our financial\nstatements, as further detailed above. In addition, it is subject to inherent limitations as it reflects\nthe exercise of judgment by management about which expenses are excluded or included in\ndetermining Adjusted EBITDA.\nA reconciliation is provided at the end of this press release for Adjusted EBITDA to net profit or\nloss, the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with IFRS. Investors\nare encouraged to review net loss and the reconciliation to Adjusted EBITDA included below and\nto not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nConstant Currency\nNayax presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our\nunderlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Future\nexpected results for transactions in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into\nUnited States dollars using the exchange rates in effect in the last month of the reporting period.\nNayax provides this financial information to aid investors in better understanding our performance.\nThese constant currency financial measures presented in this release should not be considered\nas a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance\nwith IFRS.\n7\nThe Company cannot provide expected 2024 net income without unreasonable effort because\ncertain items that impact net income are out of the Company's control and/or cannot be\nreasonably predicted at this time, of which unavailable information could have a significant impact\non the Company’s IFRS financial results.\nAbout Nayax\nNayax is a global commerce enablement, payments and loyalty platform designed to help\nmerchants scale their business.
