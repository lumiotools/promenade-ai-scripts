(NASDAQ: ICAD) (“iCAD” or the “Company”), a global leader in clinically proven AI-powered cancer detection solutions, will showcase its groundbreaking breast health AI technologies at the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) 2024 Annual Meeting in Chicago, December 1-5.\n\nKey highlights include the recent FDA-cleared ProFound Detection Version 4, clinical research presentations, and a new partnership with Cascaid Health to expand access to AI-driven breast health solutions.\n\n**iCAD and Cascaid Health Partner to Expand Access to AI-Driven Breast Health**\n\nIn alignment with their vision to enable all women to access to AI-powered breast health services, iCAD and Cascaid Health will unveil their collaboration to integrate the ProFound AI Breast Health Suite into Cascaid’s leading edge digital health marketplace and access to care platform. Scheduled for beta launch in Q1 2025, this partnership between iCAD and Cascaid Health will launch ProFound Health, a virtual care model powered by Cascaid. ProFound will enable women who have not otherwise received an AI-read on their screening mammogram to access iCAD’s advanced breast health technology. The initiative reflects both companies’ dedication to democratizing access to life-saving technology and creating a world where cancer can’t hide.\n\nProFound Health partnership will offer virtual second reads of mammograms leveraging ProFound AI Breast Health Suite, an AI service, providing patients without access to AI an opportunity to receive enhanced breast health insights. The initial service will include a second read detection, breast density assessment, and cancer risk evaluation from a Cascaid-affiliated specialist network of clinical experts in women’s health through Cascaid’s seamlessly integrated digital platform. By combining AI insights with expert clinical reviews, ProFound Health ensures that patients everywhere, regardless of location, can receive precision screening and personalized care.\n\n“ProFound Health empowers patients with access to critical information about their mammograms and overall breast health, allowing them to make informed decisions and take control of their care journey,” said Dana Brown, CEO and President of iCAD. “Our collaboration with Cascaid Health’s network of clinicians and AI-powered solutions is part of our ongoing commitment to bridging gaps in breast cancer care, ensuring all patients everywhere can access the accuracy and timeliness of AI solutions, and ultimately transforming patient outcomes.”\n\n“We believe that every woman should have access to the best possible information about her breast health and a high quality, personalized care plan to catch cancer early or prevent it altogether. Through our partnership with iCAD, we’re addressing a critical need to improve access to advanced breast health services,” said Dr. Candace Westgate, Director of Women’s Health for Cascaid Health. “ProFound Health is more than just a technological innovation, it’s a lifeline that empowers patients and healthcare providers with actionable insights, bridging care gaps and ensuring equitable access to precision screening and personalized breast cancer care.”\n\n**Advancing Next Generation AI Breast Health Solutions at RSNA 2024**\n\nIn addition to ProFound Health, iCAD will feature its flagship ProFound Detection Version 4.0, which recently received FDA clearance. This next-generation AI solution enhances breast cancer detection by incorporating prior exams into current analysis, improving the detection of aggressive cancers by 22%, reducing cases with no marks by 18%, and providing clinicians with more reliable insights for better decision-making.“Every two minutes, someone loses their life to breast cancer—a disease affecting over 2.3 million women annually. Early detection is critical, as five-year survival rates exceed 99% for stage 1 disease. Yet traditional mammography misses over 20% of breast cancers, particularly in dense tissue, resulting in potentially avoidable late-stage diagnoses,” said Dana Brown, President and CEO of iCAD, Inc. “ProFound Detection Version 4 revolutionizes breast cancer detection by uniquely integrating prior exams into its analysis. This advanced capability enhances sensitivity, sharpens precision, and provides radiologists with a deeper, longitudinal view of a patient’s breast health. By enabling earlier and more accurate detection, especially in dense tissue, ProFound Detection Version 4 sets a new standard in breast health AI, empowering providers to improve outcomes and save lives. Together with our strategic partnerships, we are advancing the fight against cancer and making a meaningful difference for patients worldwide.”\n\n**ICAD’S RSNA 2024 Program Highlights**\n\n**AI-Powered Insights: Advancing Cancer Detection**\n\n  * **Oral Abstract Presentation** : _“Real World Effect of Artificial Intelligence on Histopathology and Stage in Breast Cancer Screening”_\n    * **Presenter** : Kathy Schilling, M.D., Boca Raton Regional Hospital\n    * **When** : Sunday, December 1 | 10:30–11:30 AM\n    * **Where** : S406A: S2-SSBR01-6\n    * **Details** : Dr. Kathy Schilling discusses the experience with tenured radiologists on how the current use of ProFound AI improves cancer detection, even in women with dense breast tissue, compared to their performance prior to the implementation of AI. In addition, she will describe the decrease in the mean size and stage of cancers after the implementation, along with an increase in the diagnosis of lobular cancers.\n\n\n\n“The integration of ProFound AI alongside our nine dedicated breast radiologists has demonstrated remarkable improvements in cancer detection and patient outcomes across our imaging network,” said Dr. Kathy Schilling, Medical Director of the Christine E. Lynn Women’s Health & Wellness Institute at Boca Raton Regional Hospital. “We’ve seen a 23% overall increase in cancer detection rates, a 4% rise in invasive cancer detection, and doubled rates of lobular cancer detection. ProFound AI also enhanced detection in dense breast tissue by 32%, reduced invasive cancer size by 12%, and lowered histopathologic stage with a 40% reduction in T2 tumors—all without increasing DCIS diagnoses or recall rates.

Additionally, this version introduces an option for clinicians to incorporate a prior exam into a current exam’s ProFound Detection analysis.\n\nWith over 20 years of innovation and experience, iCAD was the first to introduce an FDA-cleared AI solution for DBT in 2016. ProFound Detection Version 4.0 now extends that pioneering legacy by offering enhancements in detection and precision. With today’s FDA clearance, ProFound Detection Version 4.0 is now available for implementation in the U.S. Additional global and vendor-specific regulatory expansions are anticipated through 2025.\n\nBeyond its enhanced clinical performance, ProFound Detection Version 4.0 presents substantial growth potential for iCAD. As existing and new customers upgrade to this latest version and adopt cloud-based deployment and subscription programs, iCAD anticipates steady growth in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). This strategic shift to the cloud enables facilities to remain at the forefront of AI advancements while benefiting from enhanced scalability, continuous updates, and streamlined operational efficiency.\n\nCompared to previous version 3, ProFound Detection Version 4.0 provides a 22% overall improvement in detecting some of the most challenging and aggressive cancer subtypes, including:\n\n  * 50% improvement in identifying cancers within dense breast tissue,\n  * 60% improvement in identifying invasive lobular cancers,\n  * 21% improvement in detecting invasive cancers, and\n  * 38% improvement in identifying cancers smaller than 1 cm\n\n\n\n“With FDA clearance of ProFound Detection Version 4.0, iCAD continues to set new benchmarks in cancer detection, especially in the most challenging cases where accurate and early detection is critical,” said Dana Brown, President and CEO, iCAD. “This groundbreaking fourth generation of our AI solution not only enhances detection for cancers feared most by even the expert fellowship-trained breast radiologists, but also reduces the burden of potential false positives, thereby providing clinicians with a highly precise and efficient AI concurrent-reader solution. We believe this advancement strengthens our competitive position and represents a powerful driver for long-term growth.”\n\n“ProFound Detection Version 4.0 will dramatically improve breast cancer detection,” said Dr. Chirag Parghi, MD, MBA, Chief Medical Officer at Solis Mammography. “The newest version’s ability to detect subtle invasive cancers, especially within dense breast tissue, addresses one of the biggest challenges in breast imaging today. The improved precision in ProFound Detection’s lesion marking combined with the option to incorporate prior exams allows for improved clinical accuracy and more efficient reading workflows. Collectively, these upgrades will enhance the AI-enriched interpretation experience leading to meaningful adoption of AI.”\n\nAlong with improved cancer detection capabilities, ProFound Detection Version 4.0 delivers more precise lesion marking, with an 18% improvement in cases with no marks, reducing potential false positives by enhanced specificity performance. This includes:\n\n  * 20% fewer marks related to vascular calcifications, and\n  * 51% fewer marks related to non-vascular calcifications.\n\n\n\nIn a significant leap forward, ProFound Detection Version 4.0 enables clinicians to incorporate a prior exam into its AI analysis and case-score/lesion assessment on the current case, emulating the approach radiologists take when interpreting current screening exams with historical context. By integrating prior imaging data, the software provides greater precision and insight, further enhancing clinical decision-making.\n\niCAD will showcase this next-generation AI, along with its end-to-end breast health AI suite and the recently launched ProFound Cloud deployment solutions, at the upcoming 2024 Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) annual meeting, held in Chicago, IL, from December 1st to December 4th.
