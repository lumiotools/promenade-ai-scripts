(NASDAQ:APVO)** (\"_Aptevo_ \" or the \"_Company_ \"), today announced that it will conduct a reverse stock split of its outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of 1-for-37 (the \"_Reverse Stock Split_ \"). The Reverse Stock Split is expected to become effective on December [3], 2024 at 5:01 p.m. Eastern Time (the \"_Effective Time_ \"), with shares expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market, on a split-adjusted, at market open on December [4], 2024. In connection with the Reverse Stock Split, every 37 shares of the Company's common stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time will be automatically converted into one share of the Company's common stock. No change will be made to the trading symbol for the Company's shares of common stock, \"APVO\", in connection with the reverse split.\n\nThe Reverse Stock Split is part of the Company's plan to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of $1.00 per share required to maintain continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, among other benefits.\n\nThe Reverse Stock Split was approved by the Company's stockholders at the Company's Special Meeting of Stockholders held on October 25, 2024 (the \"_Special Meeting_ \") to be effected in the Board's discretion within approved parameters. Following the Special Meeting, the final ratio was approved by the Company's Board on October 25, 2024.\n\nThe Reverse Stock Split will reduce the number of shares of the Company's outstanding common stock from approximately 18.5 million shares (as of the date of this press release, when including issuances in process) to approximately 0.5 million shares, subject to adjustment for rounding, as discussed below and potential additional issuances through the effective date of the Reverse Stock Split.\n\nThe reverse split will affect all issued and outstanding shares of common stock. All outstanding options, restricted stock units, warrants, and other securities entitling their holders to purchase or otherwise receive shares of common stock will be adjusted as a result of the reverse split, as required by the terms of each security. The number of shares available to be awarded under the Company's equity incentive plans will also be appropriately adjusted. Following the reverse split, the par value of the Common Stock will remain unchanged at $0.001 par value per share. The reverse split will not change the authorized number of shares of common stock or preferred stock. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the reverse split, and stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of Common Stock, the Company will round up to the next whole share.\n\nAdditional information regarding the reverse stock split is available in the Company's definitive proxy statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on October 3, 2024 and a Current Report on Form 8-K which the Company plans to file following the Effective Time.\n\n**About Aptevo Therapeutics**\n\nAptevo Therapeutics Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel bispecific immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.

Aptevo has five compounds in clinical and preclinical development and anticipates introducing a new molecule in early 2025.\n\nThis leadership opportunity underscores Aptevo's technology and its commitment to driving innovation in functional drug production, creating molecules that perform in the clinic the way they were designed to perform at inception.\n\n\"_Therapeutic candidates are often talked about once they are in human trials, especially when positive results are generated. But the genesis of those drugs and the speed with which they are produced, serves as the backbone of all therapeutic innovation. We work to create molecules that will be safe and tolerable in humans and target cancers as directly and effectively as possible,\" said Dr. Pavlik. \"My presentation will describe how employing modular biotherapeutics can drive pipeline productivity, a critical capability, especially for smaller biotechnology companies navigating a competitive landscape. More specifically, we will explore the power of Aptevo's ADAPTIR™ and ADAPTIR-FLEX™ platform technologies, which enable the rapid development of novel multispecific biotherapeutics, accelerating the journey from drug discovery to clinical trials and ultimately patient benefit_.\"\n\n**About Dr. Pavlik**\n\nPeter Pavlik, PhD, serves as the Senior Director of Protein Engineering at Aptevo Therapeutics.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, including, without limitation, Aptevo's expectations regarding the effectiveness of its ADAPTIR® and ADAPTIR-FLEX® platform technologies and whether such technologies will accelerate drug discovery and development, statements related to the performance of Aptevo's drug candidates in the clinic and whether such performance will translate into improved patient outcomes, statements related to the progress of and enthusiasm for Aptevo's preclinical and clinical programs, statement related to Aptevo's expectation to add another targeted preclinical asset to the pipeline, statements related to Aptevo's ability to generate stockholder value, whether Aptevo will continue to have momentum in its business in the future, and any other statements containing the words \"may,\" \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"potential,\" \"designed,\" \"engineered,\" \"innovative,\" \"initiate,\" \"allow,\" \"promise,\" \"plans,\" \"will\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on Aptevo's current intentions, beliefs, and expectations regarding future events. Aptevo cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be accurate. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could differ materially from Aptevo's expectations. Investors are, therefore, cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement.\n\nThere are several important factors that could cause Aptevo's actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including a deterioration in Aptevo's business or prospects; further assessment of preliminary or interim data or different results from later clinical trials; adverse events and unanticipated problems, adverse developments in clinical development, including unexpected safety issues observed during a clinical trial; adverse developments in the U.S. or global capital markets, credit markets or economies generally; and changes in regulatory, social, macroeconomic, and political conditions. For instance, actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including the uncertainties inherent in the initiation, enrollment and maintenance of patients in clinical trials, uncertainties inherent in the results of preliminary or interim data and preclinical and clinical studies being predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials, the availability and timing of data from ongoing clinical trials, the trial design includes combination therapies that may make it difficult to accurately ascertain the benefits of mipletamig, expectations for the timing and steps required in the regulatory review process, expectations for regulatory approvals, the impact of competitive products, our ability to enter into agreements with strategic partners or raise funds on acceptable terms or at all and other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of the Company's product candidates, business or economic disruptions due to catastrophes or other events, including natural disasters or public health crises such as the novel coronavirus (referred to as COVID-19), geopolitical risks, including the current war between Russia and Ukraine as well as the war between Israel and Hamas, and macroeconomic conditions such as rising inflation and interests rates, increased market volatility and decreased consumer confidence. These risks are not exhaustive, Aptevo faces known and unknown risks. Additional risks and factors that may affect results are set forth in Aptevo's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and its subsequent reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The foregoing sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from Aptevo's expectations in any forward-looking statement. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this press release, and, except as required by law, Aptevo does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect new information, events, or circumstances.\n\n**Aptevo Therapeutics** Miriam Weber Miller Email: IR@apvo.com or millerm@apvo.comPhone: 206-859-6629\n\n**SOURCE:** Aptevo Therapeutics\n\n[press release](https://www.accesswire.com/947277/proving-the-concept-aptevo-technology-pipeline-to-exemplify-the-speed-and-power-of-modular-biotherapeutics-at-presentation)[accesswire.com](http://accesswire.com)\n"
