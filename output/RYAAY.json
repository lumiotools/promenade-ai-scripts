The Directors confirm that these arrangements and\nstructures were reviewed during the financial year.\nAs required by Section 225(2) of the Companies Act 2014, the Directors acknowledge that they are responsible\nfor the Company’s compliance with the relevant obligations. In discharging their responsibilities under Section\n225, the Directors relied on the advice both of persons employed by the Company and of persons retained by the\nCompany under contract, who they believe have the requisite knowledge and experience to advise the Company on\ncompliance with its relevant obligations.\nRelevant audit information\nThe Directors believe that they have taken all steps necessary to make themselves aware of any relevant audit\ninformation and have established that the Company’s statutory auditors are aware of that information. In so far as\nthey are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group’s statutory auditors are unaware.\nAccountability and audit\nThe Directors have set out their responsibility for the preparation of the financial statements on page 57. They have\nalso considered the going concern position of the Company and their conclusion is set out on page 33.\nThe Board established an Audit Committee whose principal tasks are to consider financial reporting and internal\ncontrol issues. The Audit Committee, which consists exclusively of independent Non-Executive Directors, meets at\nleast quarterly to review the financial statements of the Company, to consider internal control procedures and to liaise\nwith internal and external auditors. In the year ended March 31, 2024 the Audit Committee met on 5 occasions. At\nleast quarterly, the Audit Committee receives an extensive report from the Head of Internal Audit detailing the reviews\nperformed in the year to date. This report is used by the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors, as a basis for\ndetermining the effectiveness of internal control and identifying emerging risks. They also receive an enterprise risk\nassessment of the Group twice a year. The Audit Committee regularly considers the performance of internal audit and\nhow best financial reporting and internal control principles should be applied.\nIn addition, the Audit Committee has responsibility for appointing, setting compensation and overseeing the work of\nthe external auditor.

The Board’s primary focus is on strategy formulation, policy and control. It has a formal schedule of matters\nspecifically reserved to it for its attention, including matters such as approval of the annual budget, large capital\nexpenditure, and key strategic decisions.\n16\n4202\nTROPER\nLAUNNA\nPUORG\nRIANAYR\nOther matters reserved to the Board include treasury policy and procedures, internal control, audit and risk\nmanagement, ESG, remuneration of the Executive Director and Senior Management and corporate governance. The\nBoard has delegated responsibility for the management of the Group to the Group CEO and the Senior Management\nteam. There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Group CEO, which is set out in\nwriting and has been approved by the Board.\nChairman\nStan McCarthy has served as the Chairman of the Board since June 2020, having served as Deputy Chairman from\nApril 2019. He was appointed a Director in May 2017. The Chairman’s primary responsibility is to lead the Board,\nto ensure that it has a common purpose, is effective as a group and at individual Director level, and that it upholds\nand promotes high standards of integrity and corporate governance. He ensures that Board agendas cover the key\nstrategic issues confronting the Group; that the Board reviews and approves management’s plans for the Group;\nand that Directors receive accurate, timely, clear and relevant information.\nThe Chairman is the link between the Board and the Company. He is specifically responsible for establishing\nand maintaining an effective working relationship with the Group CEO, for ensuring effective and appropriate\ncommunications with shareholders and for ensuring that members of the Board develop and maintain an\nunderstanding of the views of shareholders.\nWhile Stan McCarthy holds a small number of other directorships (see page 123), the Board considers that these\ndo not interfere with the discharge of his duties to Ryanair.\nSenior Independent Director\nThe Board appointed Róisín Brennan as the Senior Independent Director (“SID”) with effect from April 2024, a\nrole previously held by Louise Phelan. The SID is available to shareholders who have concerns that cannot be\naddressed through the Chairman, Group CEO or Group CFO and leads the annual Board review of the performance\nof the Chairman.\nCompany Secretary\nThe appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the Board. All Directors have access to the\nadvice and services of the Company Secretary (Juliusz Komorek), who is responsible to the Board for ensuring that\nBoard procedures are complied with.\nMembership\nAt March 31, 2024 the Board consisted of one Executive, a Non-Executive Chairman and 12 Non-Executive Directors\n(“NEDs”) and approximately 43% of the Board were women. Following the retirement of Michael Cawley and Louise\nPhelan (both in June 2024) and the appointments of Jinane Laghrari Laabi and Amber Rudd (both from July 1,\n2024) the gender split is 50:50. It is the practice of Ryanair that a majority of the Board will be Non-Executives, each\nconsidered by the Board to be independent, and the Chairman is Non-Executive. The Board considers the current\nsize, composition and diversity of the Board to be appropriate. The composition of the Board and the principal\nBoard Committees are set out below. Biographies of the Directors are available on pages 123 to 124. The Board,\nwith the assistance of the Nomination Committee, keeps Board composition under review to ensure that it includes\nthe necessary mix of relevant skills and experience required to perform its role.\nEach Director has extensive business experience, which they bring to bear in governing the Company. The Board\nconsiders that, between them, the Directors bring the range of skills, knowledge, diversity, and experience, including\ninternational and aviation experience, necessary to lead the Group. The Chairman has significant public company\nexperience. Historically, the Company has always separated the roles of Chairman and Group CEO for the running\nof the business and implementation of the Board’s strategy and policy.\n16\n17 18\n4202\nTROPER\nLAUNNA\nPUORG\nRIANAYR\nSTAN MCCARTHY (NON EXEC CHAIRMAN) (i) RÓISÍN BRENNAN (NON EXEC SID) EAMONN BRENNAN (NON EXEC) (ii)\nIndependent: Yes Independent: Yes Independent: Yes\nYears: 7 Years: 6 Years: 1\nCitizenship: Irish/US Citizenship: Irish Citizenship: Irish\nCommittee: Committee: Committee:\nExecutive Executive Remuneration (Chair)\nNomination (Chair) Remuneration Safety & Security\nMICHAEL CAWLEY (NON EXEC) (iii) EMER DALY (NON EXEC) GEOFF DOHERTY (NON EXEC)\nIndependent: Yes Independent: Yes Independent: Yes\nYears: 10 Years: 6 Years: 3\nCitizenship: Irish Citizenship: Irish Citizenship: Irish\nCommitee: Committee: Committee:\nN/A Audit Audit (Chair)\nBERTRAND GRABOWSKI (NON EXEC) (iv) ELISABETH KÖSTINGER (NON EXEC) (ii) JINANE LAGHRARI LAABI (NON EXEC) (v)\nIndependent: Yes Independent: Yes Independent: Yes\nYears: <1 Years: 1 Years: <1\nCitizenship: French Citizenship: Austrian Citizenship: Moroccan\nCommittee: Committee: Committee:\nAudit Nomination Nomination\nHOWARD MILLAR (NON EXEC) ROBERTA NERI (NON EXEC) (vi) ANNE NOLAN (NON EXEC)\nIndependent: Yes Independent: Yes Independent: Yes\nYears: 9 Years: <1 Years: 1\nCitizenship: Irish Citizenship: Italian Citizenship: Irish\nCommittee: Committee: Committee:\nExecutive (Chair) Remuneration Nomination\nNomination\nMIKE O’BRIEN (NON EXEC) MICHAEL O’LEARY (EXEC) LOUISE PHELAN (NON EXEC) (iii)\nIndependent: Yes Independent: No Independent: Yes\nYears: 8 Years: 28 Years: 11\nCitizenship: Irish Citizenship: Irish Citizenship: Irish\nCommittee: Committee: Commitee:\nSafety & Security Executive N/A\n(Co-Chair)\nAMBER RUDD (NON EXEC) (v) JULIUSZ KOMOREK (CO.

The focus of the Board, through Nomco, is to maintain\na Board with the relevant expertise, quality and experience required by Ryanair to advance the Company and\nshareholder value. Ryanair recognizes the benefits of diversity, including gender, geographic and ethnic diversity.\nRyanair’s Articles of Association require that all of the Directors retire and offer themselves for re-election within a\nthree-year period. All Directors on page 17, with the exception of Michael Cawley and Louise Phelan who retired in\nJune 2024, will be offering themselves for re-election at the AGM on September 12, 2024.\nGeoff Doherty is Chair of the Audit Committee, Stan McCarthy is Chair of Nomco, and Róisín Brennan is Chair of the\nRemuneration Committee (\"Remco\"), although Eamonn Brennan will take over as Remco Chair from July 1, 2024 to\nallow Róisín Brennan to focus on her SID role.\nSenior Management regularly brief the Board, including new members, in relation to operational, financial, ESG\nand strategic issues concerning the Ryanair Group. The Board also has direct access to Senior Management, as\nrequired, in relation to any queries they have concerning the operation of the Company. The terms and conditions of\nappointment of NEDs are set out in their letters of appointment, which are available for inspection at the Company’s\nregistered office during normal office hours and at the AGM of the Company.\nOther Relevant Factors\nCertain Non-Executive Directors hold share options over a small quantity of shares as set out in the Directors'\nReport. Whilst the 2018 Code notes that the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors should not ordinarily include\nshare options, the Company has a NASDAQ listing and has a substantial U.S. shareholder base. The granting of\nshare options to Non-Executive Directors to align interests of shareholders and Directors is an established market\npractice in the U.S., which is typically encouraged by U.S. investors. The Company in accordance with the 2018\nCode sought and received shareholder approval to make these share option grants to its Non-Executive Directors\nand the Board believes the modest number of options granted to Non-Executive Directors does not impair their\nindependence of judgement and character. Further to the above, and following consultation with key shareholders\nand the approval of a new Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP 2019”) by shareholders at the 2019 AGM, which replaced\nthe previous 2013 Share Options Plan for all future share based payments, the Non-Executive Directors will not\nreceive any further share option grants or performance based shares.\nWith the exception of the historic modest grant of share options, there were no relationships or circumstances of\nrelevance under the 2018 Code impacting Non-Executive Directors’ independence. Furthermore, in line with best\ngovernance practices, Ryanair has adopted a policy whereby all Directors retire on an annual basis and, being\neligible for re-election, offer themselves for election. This affords Ryanair’s shareholders an annual opportunity to\nvote on the suitability of each Director.\nNomco have confirmed to the Board that it considers all NEDs offering themselves for re-election at the 2024 AGM\nto be independent and that they continue to effectively contribute to the work of the Board. Nomco recommends\nthat the Company accept the re-election of the Directors.\nBoard Procedures\nAll Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and the Board has established\na procedure whereby Directors wishing to obtain advice in the furtherance of their duties may take independent\nprofessional advice at the Company’s expense.\nDirectors meet with key members of Senior Management with a particular focus on ensuring NEDs are fully informed\non issues of relevance to Ryanair and its operations. Extensive papers on key business issues are provided to all\nDirectors in connection with the Board and Committee meetings. All Directors are encouraged to update and\nrefresh their skills and knowledge, for example, through attending courses on technical areas or external briefings\nfor NEDs.\n20\n4202\nTROPER\nLAUNNA\nPUORG\nRIANAYR\nThe Company has Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance in place in respect of any legal actions taken against\nthe Directors in the course of the exercise of their duties. New NEDs are encouraged to meet the Executive Director\nand Senior Management for briefing on the Group’s developments and plans.\nIndependence\nThe Board has carried out its annual evaluation of the independence of each of its NEDs, taking account of the\nrelevant provisions of the 2018 Code, namely, whether each Director is independent in character and judgement\nand free from relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the Director’s\njudgement. The Board regards all of the NEDs at the date of this report as independent and has concluded that no\none individual or group exerts an undue influence on others.\nWithin its independence review, the Board has considered the following items with respect to certain individual\nNEDs.\nCircumstances of relevance under Status within the spirit\nDirector Basis upon which the Board has\nthe 2018 Code in determining and meaning of the\n& Role determined independence\nindependence 2018 Code\nThe Board considered Howard Millar’s outside\nbusiness interests and the (9 month) gap between\nfinishing his Executive role in 2014 and his election\nH.

Detailed Board papers are circulated in\nadvance so that Board members have adequate time and information to be able to participate fully at the meeting.\nThe holding of detailed Board meetings and the fact that many matters require Board approval, demonstrates that\nthe running of the Company is firmly in the hands of the Board. The NEDs meet periodically without Executives being\npresent. Led by the SID, the NEDs meet without the Chairman present at least annually to appraise the Chairman’s\nperformance and on such other occasions as are deemed appropriate.\nRemuneration\nDetails of remuneration paid to the Directors are set out in Note 18 on pages 221 and 222. Also, please see the Report\nof the Remuneration Committee on Directors’ Remuneration on pages 47 to 56.\nNon-Executive Directors\nNEDs are remunerated primarily by way of Directors’ fees, supplemented by occasional grants of non-performance\nordinary shares (under LTIP 2019). Details are disclosed in the in Note 18(b) on page 222.\n21 22\n4202\nTROPER\nLAUNNA\nPUORG\nRIANAYR\nExecutive Director Remuneration\nThe Group CEO is the only Executive Director on the Board. In addition to his base salary he was eligible for a performance\nbonus of up to 50% of base salary in fiscal year 2024 dependent upon the achievement of certain ambitious performance\ntargets. It is considered that the significant shareholding of the Group CEO as well as (unvested) share options granted\n(awarded as part of his contract of employment to July 2028), acts to align his interests with those of shareholders and\ngives him a keen incentive to perform to the highest levels. Full details of the Executive Director’s remuneration are set\nout in Note 18(a) on page 221.\nShare Ownership and Dealing\nDetails of the Directors’ interests in Ryanair shares are set out in the Directors’ Report on pages 10 and 11.\nThe Board has adopted a code of dealing in securities of Ryanair Holdings plc, to ensure compliance with the Listing\nRules of Euronext Dublin, applicable to transactions in Ryanair shares, debt instruments, derivatives or other financial\ninstruments by persons discharging managerial responsibilities (“PDMRs”) (e.g., Directors), persons closely associated\nwith persons discharging managerial responsibilities (“PCAs”) and relevant Company employees (together, “Covered\nPersons”). The code of dealing also includes provisions which are intended to ensure compliance with U.S. securities\nlaws and regulations of the NASDAQ National market. Under the code of dealing, Covered Persons are required to\nnotify the Company and in the case of PDMRs and PCAs only, the Central Bank, of any transaction conducted on\ntheir own account in Ryanair shares, debt instruments, derivatives or other financial instruments. Directors are also\nrequired to obtain clearance from the Chairman or Group CEO (or other person designated for such purpose) before\nundertaking such transactions, whilst Covered Persons who are not Directors must obtain clearance from designated\nSenior Management. Covered Persons are prohibited from undertaking such transactions during Closed Periods as\ndefined by the code of dealing and at any time during which the individual is in possession of inside information (as\ndefined in the EU Market Abuse Regulation (596/2014)).\nBoard Succession and Structure\nThe Board plans for its own succession with guidance from Nomco. Nomco regularly reviews the structure, size and\ncomposition (including the skills, knowledge and experience) required of the Board compared to its current position\nwith regard to the strategic needs of Ryanair and recommends changes to the Board. There is a formal, thorough and\ntransparent procedure for the appointment of new Directors to the Board. Nomco, recognising the benefits of diversity\n(including gender, geographic and ethnic diversity), identifies and selects candidates on merit against objective criteria,\nto ensure that the Board has the skills, knowledge and expertise required. Nomco has access to external advisors/\nrecruiters as required and seeks such assistance (as necessary) to assist with Board succession planning.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, Eamonn Brennan (April 2023), Elisabeth Köstinger (April 2023), Bertrand Grabowski (October\n2023) and Roberta Neri (February 2024) joined the Board as NEDs. Jinane Laghrari Laabi and Amber Rudd were recently\nappointed to the Board effective July 1, 2024. Having successfully overseen the rotation of external auditors from KPMG\nto PwC during fiscal year 2023, Dick Milliken retired from the Board in September 2023. Both Michael Cawley and Louise\nPhelan retired from the Board in late June 2024.\nSuccession planning (for both Board refreshment and Senior Management) is typically an agenda item at each Nomco\nmeeting and most Board meetings.\n22\n4202\nTROPER\nLAUNNA\nPUORG\nRIANAYR\nThe Chairman recently refreshed the membership of Board Committees as set out in the table below (effective July 1,\n2024):\nSafety &\nAudit Nomco Remco ExecCo\nSecurity\nStan McCarthy (Chair) Chair Member\nRóisín Brennan (SID) Member Member\nEamonn Brennan Chair Member\nEmer Daly Member\nGeoff Doherty Chair\nBertrand Grabowski Member\nElisabeth Köstinger Member\nJinane Laghrari Laabi Member\nHoward Millar Member Chair\nRoberta Neri Member\nAnne Nolan Member\nMike O’Brien Co-Chair\nMichael O’Leary (CEO) Member\nAmber Rudd Member\nAs at March 31, 2024, the Board comprised 14 Directors as set out on page 10.

In\nreaching that conclusion, Ryanair considered the character, judgement, objectivity and integrity of each Director and had\ndue regard for the 2018 Code. Ryanair continually endeavours to maintain the quality and independence of its Board.\nDiversity\nThe Board is supportive of the target that women should represent 33% of boards (as set out in the Irish Government's\n“Balance for Better Business” initiative). At March 31, 2024, approximately 43% of the Board were women and, at July\n1, 2024 the gender split is 50:50.

Róisín Brennan served as a member of the Audit Committee until March 31, 2024. The Board has determined that\nGeoff Doherty is the Committee’s financial expert. It can be seen from the Directors’ biographies appearing on pages\n123 to 124, that the members of the Committee bring to it a wide range of experience and expertise, much of which is\nparticularly appropriate for membership of the Audit Committee.\nNumber of Audit Committee meetings:\nThe Committee met 5 times during the year ended March 31, 2024. Individual attendance at these meetings is set out in\nthe table on page 27. The Group CFO, the Head of Internal Audit and other Senior Finance and IT managers (as required)\nnormally attend meetings of the Committee.

The Committee\nconsidered the Group’s cash generation projections over the next three years to the end of fiscal year 2027. On\nthe basis of the review performed, and the discussions held with management, the Committee was satisfied that\nit was appropriate that the financial statements should continue to be prepared on a going concern basis, and that\nthere were no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going\nconcern which need to be disclosed in the Annual Report. Please also refer to the Company’s Viability Statement\non pages 33 and 34.\nThe Audit Committee also had detailed discussions with management concerning the judgements involved in:\ni. the preparation and issuance of a Class 1 Circular pertaining to the proposed purchase of up to 300 Boeing 737-\nMAX-10 aircraft;\nii. determining the level of passenger demand and its corresponding impact on the flight schedules for fiscal year\n2025, which has an impact on the effectiveness of the Company’s jet-fuel hedges; and\niii. the timing of future payments for aircraft purchases that are dependent on the aircraft manufacturer’s ability to\nmeet forecast aircraft delivery schedules, which can impact on the effectiveness of the Company’s hedges of\nfuture aircraft purchases.\nThe Committee considered the requirements under section 225 of the Irish Companies Act 2014 in relation to the\nDirectors’ Compliance Statement which applied to the Company for the year ended March 31, 2024 and has ensured\nthat the Directors are aware of their responsibilities and fully comply with this provision.\nIn addition, the Committee completed an evaluation of the external audit process.

The Committee’s policy is to expressly pre-approve every\nengagement of Ryanair’s external auditor for all audit and non-audit services provided to the Company. Only those\nservices deemed permissible under Statutory Instrument No. 312 of 2016 and U.S. SEC rules may be provided by\nthe external auditor.\nThe auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”), who were appointed in fiscal year 2023, will continue in office in\naccordance with the provisions of Section 383(2) of the Companies Act 2014.

This external evaluation identified key strengths of the Board and helped\nthe Board develop an action plan to address areas for improvement, including forward planning and retention of\nan adequate skillset mix within the Board and its Committees while enhancing Board diversity during a period of\nrefreshment with several long-serving directors due to retire in 2024 and 2025.\nThe Board has monitored progress with the implementation of the action plan which emerged from the 2023\nexternal evaluation process and believes that it has had a positive impact on the functioning and effectiveness of\nthe Board.\nThe Board conducted an internal evaluation during 2024, which highlighted the benefit of the measures introduced\nfollowing the 2023 review, including continued emphasis on Board and senior management succession\nand refreshment needs. The review covered performance and effectiveness of the Board, including Board\ncommunications, leadership and accountability. The Board intends to continue carrying out an evaluation of its\nperformance and effectiveness annually.\nStakeholder’s engagement\nThe Board recognises its responsibilities in respect of Provision 5 of the 2018 Code in relation to stakeholder\nengagement. Key stakeholders include our Workforce, Shareholders and Customers.\nWorkforce\nAs noted above, Eamonn Brennan is Ryanair’s NED with oversight of workforce engagement. The role of the\nWorkforce Engagement NED is to engage with employees and bring feedback to the Board so together, the Board\ncan understand and consider these views in its decision making. The Board includes Workforce Engagement as\nan agenda item at least quarterly. During the past year, Eamonn Brennan, as Workforce Engagement NED, built\nupon previous panel engagements and hosted several panel discussions with various teams including our cabin\ncrew, engineers, ground ops, Labs team, office support staff and pilots. The mix of those in attendance at each of\nthe panel discussions provided valuable insights into the working life of our people. Suggestions made at various\npanel discussions have subsequently been incorporated by the Company, including improvements to operational\nplanning, staff travel and staff benefits. Eamonn Brennan reported to the Board on employee engagement at least\nquarterly throughout fiscal year 2024.\nShareholders\nRyanair recognizes the importance of communications with shareholders. Ryanair communicates with its\nshareholders following the release of quarterly and annual results directly via roadshows, recorded results\npresentations made available on the investor relations section of our website (https//investor.ryanair.com), investor\nand sustainability days, conferences, corporate governance & ESG forums and/or by analyst calls. The Group CEO,\nGroup CFO, Director of Sustainability & Finance, Head of Investor Relations, and other Senior Managers participate\nin these events.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024 the Company held discussions with a substantial number of institutional\ninvestors, analysts, ESG advisors (incl. CDP, ISS-Governance, MSCI and Sustainalytics) and proxy advisor firms\n(incl. Glass Lewis, ISS and PIRC). Additionally, NEDs including the Chairman, SID, Committee Chairs and Workforce\nEngagement NED (as appropriate) met shareholders at the Company’s semi-annual Shareholder Corporate\nGovernance & ESG forums. These successful events provided an opportunity for shareholders to directly engage\nwith Board members and Senior Management on a range of different ESG topics. We look forward to hosting\nsimilar events in the future.\n29 30\n4202\nTROPER\nLAUNNA\nPUORG\nRIANAYR\nThe Board is kept informed of the views of shareholders through the Executive Director and Senior Management\n(including the Group CFO, Director of Sustainability & Finance and Head of Investor Relations). Furthermore, feedback\nfrom roadshow meetings and investor relations analyst reports are provided to the entire Board on a regular basis.\nIn addition, the Board determines, on a case by case basis, specific issues where it would be appropriate for the\nChairman, SID, Workforce Engagement NED and/or Chairs of Board Committees to communicate directly with\nshareholders or to indicate that they are available to communicate if shareholders so wish. If any of the NEDs wish\nto attend meetings with major shareholders, arrangements are made accordingly.\nCustomers\nEvery customer who flies with Ryanair is invited to rate their trip based on a number of criteria. This rating forms\nthe basis of the Customer Satisfaction (“CSAT”) survey. A Customer Experience Forum meets monthly to review\nfeedback from the CSAT survey and identify meaningful actions to improve customer’s experience. CSAT scores\nare published monthly on Ryanair’s website (https://corporate.ryanair.com/facts-figures/customer-satisfaction).\nIn fiscal year 2024, Customer Panel events were held to obtain direct feedback on the improvements customers\nwanted. This feedback helps form the basis of our fiscal year 2025 Customer Programme. Ryanair recorded a\nstrong CSAT score of over 85% in fiscal year 2024.\nIn fiscal year 2022, Ryanair established a Customer Panel which meets periodically to provide valuable feedback\nand insights to enable Ryanair to improve it’s customer offerings. For further details, refer to page 30 in our 2024\nSustainability Report – 'Aviation with Purpose'.\nIn fiscal year 2024, a materiality assessment was conducted, whereby, key stakeholders were surveyed to\nunderstand the ESG topics that are of importance to them. The Group has used the feedback of this assessment\nto form the basis of the key topics the Group will report and monitor. Further detail on the materiality assessment\nis outlined in our 2024 Sustainability Report – 'Aviation with Purpose' which is available on the Company’s website\n(https://corporate.ryanair.com/sustainability/).\n30\n4202\nTROPER\nLAUNNA\nPUORG\nRIANAYR\nGeneral Meetings\nAll shareholders are given adequate notice of the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”).\nRyanair will continue to propose a separate resolution at the AGM on each substantially separate issue, including\na separate resolution relating to the Directors’ Report and financial statements.

The AGM affords shareholders the opportunity to question the\nChairman and the Board.\nAll holders of Ordinary Shares are entitled to attend, speak and vote at general meetings of the Company, subject\nto limitations described under note “Limitations on Share Ownership by Non-EU Nationals” on pages 141 to 144.\nIn accordance with Irish company law, the Company specifies record dates for general meetings, by which date\nshareholders must be registered in the Register of Members of the Company to be entitled to attend. Record dates\nare specified in the notes to the Notice convening the meeting.\nShareholders may exercise their right to vote by appointing a proxy or proxies, by electronic means or in writing, to\nvote some or all of their shares. The requirements for the receipt of valid proxy forms are set out in the notes to\nthe Notice convening the Meeting.\nA shareholder or group of shareholders, holding at least 5% of the issued share capital, has the right to requisition\nan Extraordinary General Meeting (“EGM”).

The AGM\nwill be held at 9.00a.m. on September 12, 2024 in the Ryanair Engineering Centre, 230/240 Lakeshore Drive, Airside\nBusiness Park, Swords, K67 XF79, Co. Dublin, Ireland.\nAll general meetings other than the AGM are called EGMs. An EGM must be called by giving at least 21 clear days’\nnotice. Except in relation to an adjourned meeting, 3 members, present in person or by proxy, entitled to vote upon\nthe business to be transacted, shall be a quorum. The passing of resolutions at a general meeting, other than a\nspecial resolution, requires a simple majority. To be passed, a special resolution requires a majority of at least 75%\nof the votes cast. Votes may be given in person by a show of hands, or by proxy.\nAt the Meeting, after each resolution has been dealt with, details are given of the level of proxy votes cast on each\nresolution and the numbers for, against and withheld. This information is made available on the Company’s website\nfollowing the meeting. At the 2023 AGM, as was highlighted by the meeting’s Chair during the AGM and reported\nimmediately following the AGM, discretionary proxies representing 0.001% of shares were voted in favour of the\nresolutions by the meeting’s Chairman. The Company will continue to report such discretionary proxy voting in\nfuture Annual Reports and with the results of AGM voting (issued immediately following each AGM).\nAt the 2023 AGM, all resolutions were passed by the requisite majority. However, the Board noted that, resolutions\n3 (non-binding) and 4(g) passed with a majority of less than 80% (receiving votes in favour of approximately 73%\nand 76%, respectively). In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, Ryanair updated shareholders in\nMarch 2024 on subsequent actions taken by the Board. The Board has continued to engage with shareholders\n30\n31 32\n4202\nTROPER\nLAUNNA\nPUORG\nRIANAYR\nto further understand and discuss any concerns with respect to these resolutions. The Board is grateful to those\nshareholders who took the time to engage in these discussions and we received helpful feedback (further details\nof which are set out in section 1 of the Report of the Remuneration Committee on Directors' Remuneration on page\n47). From the consultations conducted both before and after the AGM, the Company has an understanding of the\nreasons why a minority of shareholders were not supportive of these resolutions and will consider these views in\nfurther decision making.\nRisk Management & Internal Control\nThe Directors have overall responsibility for the Company’s system of risk management and internal control and for\nreviewing its effectiveness. The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for the system of risk management and\ninternal control which is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives\nand can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.\nIn accordance with the Financial Reporting Council’s “Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related\nFinancial and Business Reporting”, most recently revised in September 2014, the Board confirms that there is an\nongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing any significant risks faced by the Group, that it has been\nin place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of the financial statements and that this process\nis regularly reviewed by the Board.\nIn accordance with the provisions of the 2018 Code, the Directors review the effectiveness of the Company’s\nsystem of internal control including:\n• Financial\n• Operational\n• Compliance\n• Risk Management\nThe Board is ultimately responsible for the Company’s system of risk management and internal controls and for\nmonitoring its effectiveness.

As referred\nto above in the Directors’ Report, the Group CEO’s employment agreement does not contain provisions providing\nfor compensation on his termination.\nGoing Concern\nIn adopting the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements, the Directors have considered Ryanair’s\navailable sources of finance including access to the capital markets, sale and leaseback transactions, secured debt\nstructures, the Group’s cash-on-hand of approximately €4.1bn at March 31, 2024, and cash generation projections,\ntogether with factors likely to affect its future performance, as well as the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties\nas noted on pages 67 to 86.\nThe Board are satisfied that it remains appropriate to adopt the going concern concept. In arriving at this decision,\nthe Board considered, among other things:\n1. The Ryanair Group’s liquidity with over €4.1bn cash at March 31, 2024 (despite €2.4bn capital expenditure),\n€0.26bn undrawn funds under the Group’s €0.75bn revolving credit facility, and the Group’s continued focus on\ncash management;\n2. The Group’s solid BBB+ (stable) credit rating with both S&P and Fitch Ratings;\n3. The Group’s strong balance sheet with 100% of its owned Boeing 737 fleet unencumbered;\n4. The Group’s access to the debt capital markets, unsecured/secured bank debt and sale & leaseback transactions;\n5. Ongoing cost reductions across the Group coupled with the Group’s ability (as evidenced throughout the\nCovid-19 crisis) to preserve cash and reduce operational and capital expenditure in a downturn; and\n6. Increased bookings and passenger traffic.\nBased on the assessment of the adequacy of the financial forecasts, testing various scenarios and considering\nthe uncertainties described above, and current funding facilities outlined, the Directors have formed a judgement,\nat the time of approving the financial statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and\nthe Group as a whole have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least twelve\nmonths from the date of approval of the financial statements and that there were no material uncertainties that\nmay cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nFor this reason, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.\nThe Directors’ responsibility for preparing the financial statements is explained on page 57 and the reporting\nresponsibilities of the auditor are set out in their report starting on page 162.\nViability Statement\nThe Group's internal strategic planning review processes extend over the next three years to the end of fiscal year\n2027.

The Directors considered the Group’s cash generation projections through the above\nperiod together with the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group, as outlined in the Principal Risks and\nUncertainties section starting on page 67, and the Group’s ability to mitigate and manage those risks. Appropriate\nstress-testing of the Group’s internal budgets, liquidity and cash flows are undertaken by management on an\nongoing basis to consider the potential impact of severe but plausible scenarios in which combinations of principal\nrisks materialize together.\nBased on this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in\noperation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over at least the next three years.\nCompliance Statement\nRyanair has complied, throughout the year ended March 31, 2024, with the provisions set out in the UK Corporate\nGovernance Code and the requirements set out in the Irish Corporate Governance Annex, except as outlined\nbelow.

As part of the Taxonomy Regulation, Ryanair is required to disclose how and to what extent the Group’s\nactivities are associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable under Articles 3 and 9\nof the Taxonomy Regulation and Article 10(4) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 as amended by\nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486.\nThe six environmental objectives of the regulation are:\n1. Climate change mitigation\n2. Climate change adaptation\n3. Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n4. Transition to a circular economy\n5. Pollution prevention and control\n6. Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\nA taxonomy-aligned activity is one that having identified eligibility, contributes substantially to at least one of the\nsix environmental objectives, does no significant harm to the other environmental objectives and complies with the\nminimum safeguards. According to the criteria provided in the EU Taxonomy, economic activities are “environmentally\nsustainable” if they:\n• Contribute substantially to the achievement of one or more of the six above-mentioned environmental\nobjectives,\n• Do no significant harm to the achievement of the EU’s five other environmental objectives,\n• Comply with minimum safeguards including occupational health and safety and human rights,\n• Comply with the detailed technical screening criteria set out in the respective Delegated Acts.\nThe Taxonomy Regulation defines taxonomy-eligible economic activities as those activities of the Group that comply\nwith the definitions of any of the 242 economic activities outlined in the Taxonomy Regulation.\nFor FY24, information is provided on all six environmental objectives for the first time. However, only information\non taxonomy eligibility is required for environmental objectives 3 to 6 and the economic activities newly included\nwithin the scope of the changes and additions made to the delegated act on climate change mitigation and climate\nchange adaptation in 2023. These economic activities newly incorporated into the EU Taxonomy include economic\nactivities in the aviation sector which are relevant to the Ryanair Group, specifically activity 6.19 “Passenger and\nfreight air transport” under the environmental objective, climate change mitigation. This new economic activity\ncovers all owned and leased aircraft that the Group operates for the transport of passengers and the Group has\nincorporated this economic activity into its eligibility reporting for fiscal year 2024 and will report on the alignment\nof this activity in accordance with the “environmentally sustainable” criteria set out above from FY25 onwards.

Each KPI is calculated as the amount associated with aligned\nand non-aligned economic activities (the numerator) divided by the total (denominator). As only one economic activity\nis relevant to the Ryanair Group, double counting in the allocation in the numerator of turnover, CapEx, and OpEx KPIs\nacross economic activities is avoided. These KPIs are defined below for the purposes of EU taxonomy reporting.\nThe reporting basis of the EU Taxonomy Regulation differs to the Group’s consolidated financial statements, which are\nprepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘IFRS’). These differences\ninclude, but are not limited to, a very narrow scope definition for OpEx which results in a significantly lower reported\neligible OpEx under the EU Taxonomy Regulation when compared to Total Operating Expenses as reported under IFRS.\nTurnover: Consists of Total Operating Revenues.

The Group has no significant short-term leases.\nThe OpEx KPI definition is narrower than the Group’s definition of operating expenditure and does not capture all of the\nexpenditure on otherwise sustainable spend (e.g. sustainable aviation fuel usage per 6.19 technical screening criteria).\nThe Group considers that the definitions of the OpEx KPI, when considering the Turnover KPI, does not reflect the\neconomic reality of operating a taxonomy-aligned asset. For instance, all Turnover associated with the operation of a\ntaxonomy-aligned aircraft meet the definition of the Turnover KPI, however, the costs associated with operating that\naircraft are limited to the above.

Zero direct CO2 emissions is not defined but is interpreted to be both electric and hydrogen powered aircraft. Both\nof these technologies are in their infancy and while the Group expects both technologies to become commercially\nviable in due course, these are not expected before 2035. Accordingly, the Group will be unable to report any aligned\nspend in relation to zero direct CO2 emission aircrafts in the foreseeable future.\n2. A compliant aircraft is defined as those meeting specified substantial contribution criteria of the economic activity\nCCM 3.21 Manufacturing of aircraft and certain DNSH criteria. These criteria include, but are not limited to: (i) a\nspecific ratio of CO2 emissions as a proportion of their maximum take-off mass; (ii) pollution prevention criteria, such\nas specific certification regarding noise pollution; and (iii) ensuring specific hazardous materials are not included in\nthe construction of the aircraft, including certain anti-fouling paints which are required by law, for safety reasons, to\nbe included in the aircraft. Each aircraft manufacturer shall confirm which of their aircraft meet the criteria for being\na compliant aircraft and at the date of this report, interactions are ongoing with these manufacturers to understand\ntheir ability to comply with the requirements of the EU taxonomy.\n3. The Replacement Ratio is defined as the 10-year average of the total global number of aircraft permanently withdrawn\nfrom use divided by the total global number of aircraft delivered. If the global number of aircraft delivered exceeds\nthe global number of aircraft permanently withdrawn, then the taxonomy-aligned financial metrics of the Group\nare reduced. As a result, the Replacement Ratio does not reflect the individual activities of the Group as part of its\ntransition to a low-carbon environment, but instead the entirety of the global aviation sector. Actions that influence\nsuch a global measure are outside the control of the Group and do not provide enhanced comparability within the\nairline sector to investors.\n4. As of March 31, 2024, the Group operated 584 aircraft within its fleet and does not monitor or report all revenue\nand expenditure on an individual aircraft basis. Accordingly, the Group will be required to apply judgement in\ndetermining the basis on which to allocate revenue and expenditure to the associated assets. For certain other\nsustainability reporting obligations, the Group is able to monitor jet fuel consumption by aircraft, which enables\nthe most reflective indication of activity by asset and accordingly, the Group expects to allocate revenues and\nexpenditures to each individual asset based on the proportion of fuel consumption or other appropriate activity\nmeasure for those compliant aircraft at an operating company level. No allocation assumptions are required for\nCapEx as such expenditure is monitored on an aircraft by aircraft basis.\nThe Group expects the Commission to provide further clarification and guidance in the second half of 2024 detailing\nhow to apply these criteria. Accordingly, the aforementioned judgements are subject to change and it is possible that\nfurther judgements, not detailed above, will be required.\n44\n)mrah\ntnacfiingis\non\nseoD(\nairetirc\nHSND\nairetirC\nnoitubirtnoC\nlaitnatsbuS\nnoitroporP fo ymonoxaT\nyrogetaC\nyrogetaC\netamilC\netamilC\netamilC\netamilC\ndengila\nmuminiM\nralucriC\nralucriC\nnoitroporP\nrevonruT\nlanoitisnart\ngnilbane\nytisrevidoiB\nnoitulloP\nretaW\negnahC\negnahC\nytisrevidoiB\nnoitulloP\nretaW\negnahC\negnahC\nedoC\nseitivitcA\ncimonocE\n).1.A(\nsdraugefas\nymonocE\nymonocE\nrevonruT\nfo\nm’€\nlatoT\nytivitca\nytivitca\nnoitpadA\nnoitagitiM\nnoitpadA\nnoitagitiM\nelbigile\nro\n).2.A( revonruT\n;N ;Y\n;N ;Y\n;N ;Y\n;N ;Y\n;N ;Y\n;N\n;Y\nycnerruC\nT\nE\n%\nN/Y\nN/Y\nN/Y\nN/Y\nN/Y\nN/Y\nN/Y\n%\ntxeT\n%LE/N\nLE/N\nLE/N\nLE/N\nLE/N\nLE/N\nnoillim\n€\nseitivitca\nelbigile-ymonoxaT\n.A\nseitivitca\nelbaniatsus\nyllatnemnorivnE\n1.A\n)dengila-ymonoxaT(\nseitivitca\nelbaniatsus\nyllatnemnorivne\nfo revonruT\n%0\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n%0\n%0\n0\n)1.A(\n)dengila-ymonoxaT(\nE\n%0\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n%0\n%0\n0\ngnilbanE\nhcihw\nfO\nT\n%0\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n%0\n%0\n0\nlanoitisnarT\nhcihw\nfO\nyllatnemnorivne\nton\ntub\nelbigile-ymonoxaT\n2.A\ndengila-ymonoxaT\nton(\nseitivitca\nelbaniatsus )seitivitca\nLE/N ;LE\nLE/N\n;LE\nLE/N\n;LE\nLE/N\n;LE\nLE/N\n;LE\nLE/N\n;LE\nA/N\nLE/N\nLE/N\nLE/N\nLE/N\nLE/N\nLE\n%001\n444,31\n91.6\ntropsnart\nria\nthgierf\ndna\nregnessaP\nyllatnemnorivne\nton\ntub\nelbigile-ymonoxaT\nfo revonruT\n%0\n%0\n%0\n%0\n%0\n%0\n%001\n%001\n444,31\ndengila-ymonoxaT\nton(\nseitivitca\nelbaniatsus\n)2.A(\n)seitivitca\nseitivitca\nelbigile-ymonoxaT\nfo\nrevonruT\n.A\n%0\n%0\n%0\n%0\n%0\n%0\n%001\n%001\n444,31\n)2.A+1.A(\nseitivitca\nelbigile-non\nymonoxaT\n.B\n%0\n0\nseitivitca\nelbigile-non\nymonoxat\nfo revonruT\n%001\n444,31\n)B + A(\nlatoT\n4202\nTROPER\nLAUNNA\nPUORG\nRIANAYR\n45 46\n4202\nTROPER\nLAUNNA\nPUORG\nRIANAYR\nTotal\n(A\n+ B)\n2,182\n100%\nCapEx\nof\ntaxonomy\nnon-eligible\nactivities\n108\n5%\nB.\nTaxonomy\nnon-eligible\nactivities\n(A.1+A.2)\n2,074\n95%\n100%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n0%\nA.\nCapEx\nof Taxonomy-eligible\nactivities\nactivities)\n(A.2)\nsustainable\nactivities\n(not\nTaxonomy-aligned\n2,074\n95%\n100%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n0%\nCapEx\nof\nTaxonomy-eligible\nbut\nnot\nenvironmentally\nPassenger\nand\nfreight\nair\ntransport\n6.19\n2,074\n95%\nEL\nN/EL\nN/EL\nN/EL\nN/EL\nN/EL\nN/A\nEL;

THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE (“Remco”)\nRemco determines the remuneration of Senior Management (including the Executive Director) and administers\nthe Company’s share-based remuneration plans as described on pages 53 to 55. Members of Remco as at March\n31, 2024 were Róisín Brennan (Chair), Eamonn Brennan, Michael Cawley and Roberta Neri (from February 2024).\nMichael Cawley retired from Remco in June 2024 and Amber Rudd is appointed effective July 1, 2024. Eamonn\nBrennan will take over as Remco Chair from July 1, 2024 to allow Róisín Brennan to focus on her SID role.\nThe role and responsibilities of Remco are set out in its written terms of reference, which are available on the\nCompany’s website, https://investor.ryanair.com. All members of Remco have access to the advice of the Group\nCEO and Group CFO and the Board Chairman attends meetings (by invitation) from time-to-time. Remco engages\nexternal remuneration advisors (including Deloitte, Willis Towers Watson (\"WTW\"), Ellason and other independent\nparties) to advise on various projects including the design and implementation of LTIP 2019, the setting of\nannual bonus targets as the Group emerged from the Covid-19 crisis and embarked upon an ambitious growth\nplan (including the delivery of 210 Boeing 737-8200 “Gamechanger” aircraft and up to 300 Boeing 737-MAX-10s\nout to 2034) and the extension of the Group CEO’s employment contract to July 2028 (which involved extensive\nShareholder engagement).\nAt the 2023 AGM, Ryanair’s Directors’ Remuneration Policy and Ryanair’s Directors’ Remuneration Report received\n73% and 91% support, respectively. Shareholder and proxy advisor feedback following the (non-binding) vote on\nthe Director's Remuneration Policy (which is effective for at least a 4-year period) was broadly positive, with many\ncomplimenting its simplicity and alignment with shareholders’ interests. Some concerns were expressed in relation\nto the potential value of the Executive Director’s share options if stretched performance targets are achieved and\nthe grant vests. Additionally, further clarification was sought in relation to performance targets, specifically the\n28 day period during which the Company's share price is required to exceed €21 in order for share options to\npotentially vest. Remco will consider this feedback when designing future remuneration policies. A 2023 AGM\nvoting update, highlighting the above feedback, was provided to Shareholders in March 2024.\n48\n4202\nTROPER\nLAUNNA\nPUORG\nRIANAYR\n2. REMUNERATION POLICY\nThe 2023 Directors' Remuneration Policy (approved at the AGM in September 2023) is available in full on https://\ninvestor.ryanair.com. The policy is designed to promote long-term sustainable success as follows:\n(i) Clarity\nThe Group CEO (the only Executive Director) is rewarded competitively (taking account of the comparative\nmarketplace in Europe) to ensure that he is motivated to deliver in the best interests of all shareholders.\n(ii) Simplicity\nThe remuneration of the Executive Director is structured towards a competitive basic salary (by EU comparatives)\nand a bonus scheme which allows the Executive Director to earn up to a maximum of 50% of his base pay each year\nby way of performance related bonus. In selecting annual stretch performance targets, Remco, using its discretion,\ntakes into account the Group’s strategic objectives, short and long-term business priorities. Such targets focus on\nthe Group’s key performance drivers, such as (but not limited to) traffic growth, environmental, customer service\nand other ESG goals. Annual targets will be disclosed on a prospective and retrospective basis in the Remuneration\nReport. The current targets are as follows:\n• 50% of the total bonus is payable if the Group's fiscal year 2025 (“FY25”) traffic exceeds 200m passengers.\nIf the traffic target is not achieved in the fiscal year, then 40% will be payable if the final outcome is 190m\npassengers and a further 1% will be awarded for every 1m additional passengers between 190m and 200m;\n• 20% of the total bonus is dependent upon achieving specific environmental targets. In FY25, 20% is payable if\nthe Company retains any \"A\" rating from CDP. If the Company does not achieve an A- (or better) rating, 15% of\nthe total bonus will be earned if the Company achieves at least a B rating; and\n• 30% of the total bonus is payable if Ryanair's customer satisfaction (\"CSAT\") score is, on average, 85%. The\namount payable will be scaled at 5% for an average CSAT score of 80%, 10% for 81%, 15% for 82%, 20% for 83%,\n25% for 84% and 30% for 85% or higher.\n(iii) Risk\nThe remuneration of the Executive Director is structured so as to mitigate potential remuneration-related risks.\n(iv) Predictability\nThe Group CEO’s share option grant (awarded as part of his employment contract to July 2028) with a strike of\n€11.12 has clear but very challenging targets (which have not been achieved over the last 5 years due to Covid and\nthe war in Ukraine). The PAT of the Ryanair Group must exceed €2.2bn in any year up to fiscal year 2028 (inclusive)\nand/or the Company’s share price must exceed €21 for a period of 28 days between April 1, 2021 and March\n31, 2028 (incl.). If the above targets are achieved, the final vesting condition is that the Group CEO must remain\nemployed by the Group until the end of July 2028. This gives certainty and substantial upside to all shareholders if\nor when these very challenging targets have been met.\n(v) Proportionality\nLinking share based remuneration to the Ryanair Group’s ambitious long-term targets (e.g., PAT above €2.2bn\nand/or share price above €21 as noted above) ensures that suboptimal performance is not rewarded. As share\noptions cannot vest before the end of fiscal year 2028, and can then only be exercised up to February 2029, the\nExecutive Director is fully aligned with shareholders’ interests over this extended period of time. Regardless of\nwhen stretched performance targets may be achieved, such options can only be exercised after fiscal year 2028\n(and even then their exercise will depend on the then share price and whether the options are “in the money”). If\ntargets are not achieved and/or Michael O’Leary (“MOL”) does not remain in employment to July 2028, then options\nwill not vest or be exercisable.\n48\n49 50\n4202\nTROPER\nLAUNNA\nPUORG\nRIANAYR\n(vi) Alignment to Culture\nThe Group has a policy of minimizing management expenses and accordingly it does not provide defined benefit\npensions, company cars, or unvouched expenses to senior managers. Expense claims must be vouched and are\nrigorously vetted by the Group airlines CFO’s.\nThe total remuneration paid to Senior Management (defined as the Executive team reporting to the Board of Directors\ntogether with all Non-Executive Director’s fees) is set out in Note 18 of the consolidated Financial Statements. The\nCompany’s policy in respect of share-based remuneration is dealt with in section 6 below.\n3. PERFORMANCE\nFY24 Highlights:\n• Traffic grew strongly (+9%) to 183.7m.\n• Revenue per passenger up 15% (average fare +21% & ancillary revenue +3%).\n• Fuel bill rose 32% (+€1.25bn) to €5.14bn.\n• ESG ratings upgraded (MSCI ‘A’ & CDP ‘A-‘) & strong 85% CSAT score achieved.\n• 146x Boeing 737-8200 “Gamechangers” in 584 fleet at March 2024.\n• 5 new bases and over 200 new routes opened for Summer 2024.\n• Fuel over 70% hedged for FY25 (locking-in significant price savings).\n• Maiden interim dividend (€0.175 per share) paid in February 2024. Final dividend (€0.178 per share) payable\npost AGM approval in Sept.\n• 300x Boeing 737-MAX-10 order underpins growth to 300m passengers (FY34) subject to Boeing deliveries.\nThe Ryanair Group reported FY24 PAT of €1.92bn (up 34%). Scheduled revenue increased 32% to €9.15bn. Traffic\ngrew 9% to almost 184m while average fares rose 21% to just under €49.80, thanks to a record H1 and strong Easter\ntraffic in late March, offset by softer than expected Q3 fares and load factors (following the sudden, but welcome,\nremoval of Ryanair flights from many OTA pirate websites in early December 2023). Ancillary sales increased 12%\nto €4.3bn (approx. €23.40 per passenger). Total FY24 revenue therefore rose 25% to €13.44bn.\nOperating costs increased 24% to €11.38bn, primarily due to a 32% increase in fuel costs*, higher staff costs\n(including pay restoration, crew, engineering and handler pay rises, higher crewing ratios and pilot productivity pay\nas we improve operational resilience) and Boeing delivery delays.\nRyanair’s balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry with a BBB+ credit rating (both S&P and Fitch)\nand €4.12bn gross cash at year-end despite €2.4bn capital expenditure and well over €1bn debt repayments in\nFY24. Year-end net cash was €1.37bn (PY: €0.56bn), somewhat boosted by Boeing delivery delays. The Group’s\nowned Boeing 737 fleet (556 aircraft at March 2024) is fully unencumbered, which significantly widens Ryanair’s\ncost advantage over competitor airlines, many of whom are exposed to rising aircraft lease and financing costs.\nIn February 2024 CDP awarded Ryanair an ‘A-‘ climate rating (previously ‘B’), topping off a year of ESG upgrades\nincluding an industry leading MSCI ‘A’ rating (up from ‘BBB’), and retention of Sustainalytics ranking as Europe’s\nNo.1 airline for ESG. The Group’s new aircraft and increasing use of SAF has positioned Ryanair as one of the EU’s\nmost environmentally efficient major airlines. As noted above, in FY24 the Group took delivery of 48x Boeing 737-\n8200 “Gamechangers” (4% more seats, 16% less fuel & CO2 and up to 50% quieter) and retrofitted winglets on over\n25% of its Boeing 737-800NG fleet (target 409 by 2026), reducing fuel burn by 1.5% and noise by 6%. Additionally,\nthe Group expanded its SAF partnerships and remains on track to achieve its ambitious 2030 goal of powering\n12.5% of Ryanair’s flights with SAF (with 10% supply already secured).\n50\n4202\nTROPER\nLAUNNA\nPUORG\nRIANAYR\n4. GROUP CEO PAY\nIn December 2022 MOL agreed to a 4-year contract extension as Group CEO to July 2028 (previously July 2024).\nAs part of this contract the Group CEO receives a basic salary of €1.2m p.a. (from FY24), subject to annual review.\nFor FY24 his maximum annual bonus was reduced to 50% of basic pay (previously 100%). In line with best practice,\nMOL does not receive any pension benefits. This contract extended the vesting period for the 10m share options\ngranted in February 2019, which are exercisable at a strike price of €11.12, but only if the Ryanair Group PAT\nexceeds €2.2bn (up from a prior €2.0bn target) in any year up to fiscal year 2028 (inclusive) and/or the share price\nof the Company exceeds €21 for a period of 28 days between April 1, 2021 and March 31, 2028 (incl.). If these\ntargets are not achieved, these share options will lapse and MOL will receive nothing other than his basic salary\nand annual bonus. These options will also lapse should MOL leave the Ryanair Group’s employment on/before the\nend of July 2028.\nTo the extent that options vest, they can only be exercised between April 2028 and February 2029. Additionally,\nthey will likely only be exercised to the extent that the then share price exceeds the share options strike price. The\nstretched PAT and share price targets mean that the Group CEO is fully aligned with and committed to delivering\nsuperior returns for shareholders over the entire term of his contract of employment. The Group CEO is subject to\na covenant not to compete with the Company within the EU for 12 months after the termination of his employment.\nThe options grant contains malus and claw back provisions.\nThe Group CEO is the only Executive Director of the Board. Following a review of his performance, and that of the\nGroup, in fiscal year 2024 (“FY24”) Remco awarded MOL a bonus of €588,000 (2023: €425,000).\n• Up to 50% of the total bonus was determined by reference to an FY24 traffic target of 185m passengers.\nActual traffic was below target at 183.7m primarily due to Boeing 737-8200 delivery delays. The bonus award\nwas calculated on a straight-line basis between the 170m threshold and the actual traffic achieved. Remco\ntherefore awarded just 48% of the maximum bonus linked to traffic growth, an amount of €288,000;\n• Up to 25% of the total bonus was payable if the Group received an upgrade in its CDP rating from B to A-. 20%\nof the total was payable if the Company retained its B rating. 15% of the total was payable if the Company is\nrated at least B- by CDP. In February 2024, CDP upgraded Ryanair’s rating from B to A-, so a bonus of €150,000\n(25%) was awarded; and\n• Up to 25% of the total bonus was payable if the Company’s CSAT score was, on average, 82.5% for the fiscal\nyear. As Ryanair’s CSAT score for fiscal year 2024 was 85%, ahead of target, a bonus amount of €150,000 (25%)\nwas awarded.\nBased on the performance achieved against the published targets described above, the formulaic outcome was\na payment of €588,000, or 98% of the maximum bonus level. Remco considered the holistic performance of the\nbusiness during the year, as well as the experience of the wider stakeholders, and determined that this formulaic\noutcome was appropriate in the circumstances and no further adjustment was required.\nIn relation to FY24, Remco were satisfied that the Remuneration Policy has operated as intended in terms of\nCompany performance and quantum.\n51 52\n4202\nTROPER\nLAUNNA\nPUORG\nRIANAYR\nThe Group CEO’s pay and bonus for fiscal years 2022, 2023 and 2024, is set out below:\nPercentage\nRealized Remuneration Basic €’000 Bonus €’000 Cash Total €’000\nChange y-o-y\nFY March 31, 2022* 500 475 975 +290%\nFY March 31, 2023 500 425 925 -5%\nFY March 31, 2024 1,200 588 1,788 +93%\n* In FY21 (during the Covid pandemic) the Group CEO agreed to a 50% cut in his basic pay and waived any bonus in solidarity with our people who had\nagreed pay cuts of between 5% to 20%. These pay cuts were restored in FY22. In each of the years above, the Company recorded a technical non-cash\naccounting charge in relation to share options granted to the Group CEO (primarily 10m share options granted in February 2019). These charges were:\n€1.78m (2022); €1.78m (2023); and €2.89m (2024), although it is expected that this accounting charge will significantly reduce in FY25. No such\npayments were made to the Group CEO. These options remain unvested.\nIn relation to FY25, the Group CEO’s base pay will be unchanged at €1.2m and his maximum potential bonus is\nalso unchanged at 50% of basic pay, subject to the achievement of the stretch targets set out above in section 2(ii)\nabove.\n5. NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS\nDirectors are appointed following selection by the Nomination Committee, approval by the Board, and must be\nelected by the majority of shareholders at the following AGM. Ryanair has adopted a policy whereby all Directors\nretire on an annual basis and being eligible for re-election, offer themselves for election. This therefore gives\nRyanair’s shareholders an annual opportunity to vote on the suitability of each Director.\nTo ensure that Non-Executive Director (“NED”) compensation is competitive to attract quality candidates with\nthe skills and experience to make a valuable contribution to the Ryanair Board, a review of NED remuneration\nwas carried out in 2023. Arising from this review (the first such review in over 10-years), and in keeping with the\nGroup’s commitment to keep remuneration competitive, simple and clear, with effect from FY24 NED remuneration\nis structured as follows:\n• Base fee: €75,000 p.a.\n• Additional fees payable for:\n• Senior Independent Director (“SID”): €25,000 p.a.\n• Chair of Audit, Remuneration and Safety & Security Committees: €25,000 p.a.\nAdditionally, every 2-years NEDs may be granted unconditional (i.e. no performance targets) ordinary shares under LTIP\n2019 with a value of approx. €50,000 (with the first such grant being awarded to NEDs in June 2023).\nWith effect from April 1, 2024 the Board Chairman’s fees are €150,000 p.a. and he also qualifies for a biennial grant of\nunconditional ordinary shares under LTIP 2019 with a value of approx. €50,000 (with the first such grant being awarded\nin June 2023).\nNone of the NEDs hold a service agreement with the Company that provides for benefits upon termination.\n52\n4202\nTROPER\nLAUNNA\nPUORG\nRIANAYR\nNED fees for fiscal year 2024 and 2023 are set out below:\nFees and emoluments – Non-Executive Directors\nMarch 31, 2024* March 31, 2023*\nFees Change\n€’000 €’000\nEamonn Brennan 75.0 n/a n/a\nRóisín Brennan 100.0 50.0 +100%\nMichael Cawley 75.0 50.0 +50%\nEmer Daly 75.0 50.0 +50%\nGeoff Doherty (i) 88.7 50.0 +77%\nBertrand Grabowski (ii) 37.5 n/a n/a\nElisabeth Köstinger 75.0 n/a n/a\nStan McCarthy 150.0 100.0 +50%\nHoward Millar 75.0 50.0 +50%\nDick Milliken (iii) 45.6 50.0 -9%\nRoberta Neri (iv) 12.5 n/a n/a\nAnne Nolan (v) 75.0 16.7 +349%\nMike O’Brien 100.0 75.0 +33%\nJulie O’Neill (vi) n/a 25.0 n/a\nLouise Phelan 100.0 50.0 +100%\nTotal 1,084.3 566.7 +54%**\ni) Appointed Chair of the Audit Committee in September 2023.

SHARE BASED REMUNERATION\nThe Company’s share option plan, which was approved by shareholders at the 2013 AGM (“Options Plan 2013”),\nencourages our people to think and act like long-term shareholders and prioritize sustainable returns. While this\nplan was successful, following a broad review by Remco (with the assistance of Deloitte) of the Company’s variable\npay arrangements during 2019, it became clear there was a need to introduce a more regular, formalized, long-\nterm incentive arrangement for senior managers. As such, at the September 2019 AGM the Company requested,\nand received, shareholder approval for the 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP 2019”). Under this framework,\nsenior managers may be eligible to receive regular awards, typically of whole shares rather than share options, with\nvesting based on performance against stretching three-year targets.\n54\n4202\nTROPER\nLAUNNA\nPUORG\nRIANAYR\nIn light of the award of options in February 2019 (as part of his then contract renewal, subsequently extended in\nDecember 2022) to the Group CEO under Options Plan 2013, Remco has determined that no awards will be made to\nthe Group CEO under LTIP 2019 for the duration of his existing contract out to July 2028. While NEDs are permitted\nto receive share awards (but not options) under LTIP 2019, such awards, in line with good corporate governance,\nare not subject to performance conditions.\nThis more formal framework, over time, provides senior managers with a schedule of overlapping awards, each\naligned with key performance goals for their respective periods. In this manner Remco considers that it acts as a\nmore effective driver of sustainable returns than the previous framework and a strong retention tool. It is recognized\nthat the framework of LTIP 2019 is more aligned with the general direction of the market, with arrangements in\nclose peers, and with the expectations of many shareholders.\nThe performance conditions which attach to awards granted to senior managers under the LTIP 2019 are currently a\ncombination of absolute traffic growth, relative TSR performance against airline peers and achievement of ESG targets.\nAbsolute traffic growth drives bottom-line financial performance and is a key performance indicator for Ryanair, TSR\nmeasures the Company’s relative performance against peers and reflects the overall shareholder experience and ESG\ntargets (including environmental targets) align with the Group’s goal of reducing its CO2 per passenger/km over the\ncoming years. Remco has the discretion to determine appropriate performance targets (which may be different to those\nset out above) when making grants under LTIP 2019.\nA description of the Company’s Option Plan 2013 and LTIP 2019 are available on pages 137 and 138. Details of the share\noptions granted to Directors are set forth on page 11 of the Directors' Report.\nPrior to the shareholder approval of LTIP 2019, share options were granted occasionally (under Options Plan 2013), at\nthe discretion of the Board and Remco, to incentivize superior performance by the management team, to encourage\ntheir long-term commitment to Ryanair and to align the objectives of management with those of the shareholders.\nManagement are encouraged, through share-based remuneration, to think and act like long term shareholders and\nprioritize shareholder returns. Options will only be exercisable where stretched PAT or share price targets have been\nachieved over a defined vesting period. In exceptional circumstances (specifically during periods of significant oil price\nvolatility), Remco and the Board can (under the rules of the scheme) exercise discretion in determining if performance\ntargets have been achieved. A further vesting condition is that managers must remain in full time employment for an\nagreed period from the grant date in order to exercise these options. The multi-year targets set by Remco are ambitious\nand option grants contain malus and clawback provisions.\nAs at March 31, 2024, 7 NEDs held share options as set out in the Director’s Report on page 11. These options were\ngranted in 2019 with vesting linked to either (i) achieving a PAT of €2bn before the end of FY24, or (ii) the share price\nexceeding €21 over a 28-day period by 31 March 2024, with both targets representing an approximate doubling of\nperformance levels compared to the PAT in FY19 (of €885m) and the share price at grant (of €11.12).\nThe Board, in the absence of those NEDs who hold these options, assessed the achievement of the targets at the end of\nfiscal year 2024. Whilst the share price exceeded €21 for a number of days in March 2024, it did not stay above this level\nfor the required 28 days. Actual PAT in FY24 was €1.92bn, falling just 4% short of the required €2bn level. However, the\nBoard considered the impact of exceptional fuel price levels observed in recent years (as illustrated in the chart below),\nand noted that the PAT target was set on the basis of a $700 per tonne expected jet fuel price which was c.25% below\nthat actually observed in FY24; the PAT target would have been exceeded by c.30% if the fuel price had been $700. The\nBoard applied the discretion permitted within the rules of the scheme around exceptional fuel price volatility and it was\ndecided to permit the options to vest, given (i) the one-off nature of these options, (ii) the all-or-nothing hurdles, (iii) the\nimpact of external factors over the 5-year performance period, (iv) the proximity to achieving the original hurdles, and\n(v) the expectation that NEDs will retire from the Board after a 9-year tenure, with very limited ability to extend this term\n(unlike the Executive Director whose employment contract and options vest period was, instead, extended to 2028,\nalbeit that the PAT target is now significantly higher at €2.2bn).\n55 56\n4202\nTROPER\nLAUNNA\nPUORG\nRIANAYR\nFurthermore, the Board is satisfied that the vesting of these options is appropriate given the Company’s strong relative\nperformance over the last 5 years, where the Company has significantly outperformed key airline peers in terms of Total\nShareholder Return (+87% over 5 years vs the peer group median of -41%), traffic growth (grown from 149m to 184m\nover the past 5 years despite the impact of Covid-19 and well ahead of the peer group, some of who have yet to recover\nto pre-Covid traffic) and PAT growth (+117% since FY19 vs the peer group median of +46%).

This legacy issue will, therefore, naturally disappear by\nFebruary 2026 as options are exercised or lapse. There are no other outstanding share options granted to NEDs.\nAs at March 31, 2024, 11 NEDs were granted 3,984 ordinary shares each under LTIP 2019. These LTIP grants are not\nsubject to performance targets, vest at the end of May 2026 and further align NED interests with those of long-term\nShareholders.

Ryanair operates a low-\nfares airline. The success of its business model depends on its ability to control costs so as to deliver low-fares while\nat the same time earning a profit. Ryanair has limited control over its fuel costs and already has comparatively low\noperating costs. In periods of high fuel costs, if Ryanair is unable to further reduce its other operating costs or generate\nadditional revenues, operating profits are likely to fall. Ryanair cannot offer any assurances regarding its future\nprofitability. Changes in fuel costs and availability could have a material adverse impact on Ryanair’s results. See “—\nChanges in fuel costs and availability affect the Company’s results” and “—The Company faces significant price and\nother pressures in a highly competitive environment”.\nChanges in fuel costs and availability affect the Company’s results. Jet fuel is subject to wide price fluctuations\nas a result of many economic and political factors and events occurring throughout the world that Ryanair can neither\ncontrol nor accurately predict, including increases in demand, sudden disruptions in supply and other concerns about\nglobal supply, as well as market speculation. Oil prices increased significantly following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in\nFebruary 2022 and remain volatile in light of the Israel-Hamas conflict. As international prices for jet fuel are\ndenominated in U.S. dollars, Ryanair’s fuel costs are also subject to certain exchange rate risks. Substantial price\nincreases, adverse exchange rates, or the unavailability of adequate fuel supplies, including, without limitation, any such\nevents resulting from international terrorism, prolonged hostilities in Central Eastern Europe, the Middle East or other\noil-producing regions or the suspension of production by any significant producer, may adversely affect Ryanair’s\nprofitability. In the event of a fuel shortage resulting from a disruption of oil imports or otherwise, additional increases\nin fuel prices or a curtailment of scheduled services could result.\nRyanair enters into hedging arrangements providing for substantial protection against fluctuations in fuel prices,\ngenerally through forward swap contracts or fuel call options typically covering periods of up to 12-18 months of\nanticipated jet fuel requirements. Ryanair is exposed to risks arising from fluctuations in the price of fuel, and\nmovements in the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate, especially in light of volatility in the relevant currency and commodity\nmarkets. Any movements in fuel costs could have a material adverse effect on Ryanair’s financial performance. In\naddition, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro could have an adverse effect on the cost of buying fuel in\neuro.\nNo assurances whatsoever can be given about trends in fuel prices. Average fuel prices for future years may be\nsignificantly higher than current prices. There also cannot be any assurance that Ryanair’s current or any future\narrangements will be adequate to protect Ryanair from increases in the price of fuel or that Ryanair will not incur losses\ndue to high fuel prices, either alone or in combination with other factors. Because of Ryanair’s low fares as well as\nRyanair’s expansion plans, which could have a negative impact on yields, its ability to pass on increased fuel costs to\npassengers through increased fares or otherwise is somewhat limited. The expansion of Ryanair’s fleet has resulted\nand will likely (in coming years) continue to result in an increase in Ryanair’s aggregate fuel consumption.\nAdditionally, declines in the price of oil and/or capacity declines may expose Ryanair to some risk of hedging\nlosses and hedge ineffectiveness that could lead to negative effects, including income statement volatility on Ryanair’s\nfinancial condition and/or results of operations.\nA majority of Ryanair’s aircraft and certain parts are sourced from a single supplier; therefore, Ryanair would be\nmaterially and adversely affected if such supplier were unable to provide additional equipment or support. Because Ryanair\ncurrently sources the majority of its aircraft and many related aircraft parts from Boeing, if Ryanair were unable to acquire\nadditional aircraft or sufficient spare parts from Boeing, or if Boeing were unable or unwilling to make timely deliveries\n4\nof aircraft or to provide adequate support for its products, Ryanair’s operations could be materially and adversely\naffected.\nRyanair is subject to cyber security risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks. As\nalmost all of Ryanair’s reservations are made through its website and mobile app, security breaches could expose it to\na risk of loss or misuse of customer information, litigation and potential liability. Third-party service organizations are\nused for both the reservation and flight planning processes. These third-party service organizations are also subject to\ncyber security risks. Ryanair secures its website and follows the recommendations set out in the U.S. National Institute\nof Standards and Technology’s Cyber Security Framework. Nevertheless, the security measures which have been or will\nbe implemented may not be effective, and Ryanair’s systems may be vulnerable to theft, loss, damage, and interruption\nfrom a number of potential sources and events, including unauthorized access or security breaches, cyber-attacks,\ncomputer viruses, power loss, or other disruptive events. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or\ndegrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long\nperiods of time. Ryanair may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent these rapidly\nevolving types of cyber-attacks. Attacks may be targeted at Ryanair, its customers and suppliers, or others who have\nentrusted it with information. Moreover, the war in Ukraine has resulted in a heightened risk of cyberattacks against\ncompanies like ours that have operations, vendors and/or supply chain providers located around the region of conflict.\nWhile Ryanair has experienced, and expects to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents, the Group\nhas not detected any material cyber security events during fiscal year 2024.\nRyanair is subject to increasingly complex data protection laws and regulations. Ryanair’s business involves the\nprocessing and storage on a large scale of personal data relating to its customers, employees, business partners and\nothers. Ryanair is subject to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”) (which\nbecame fully applicable on May 25, 2018) as well as relevant national implementing legislation (Irish Data Protection\nAct 2018), which impose significant obligations upon subject companies. Ensuring compliance with data protection\nlaws is an ongoing commitment which involves substantial costs, and it is possible that, despite Ryanair’s efforts,\ngovernmental authorities or third parties will assert that Ryanair’s business practices fail to comply with these laws and\nregulations. If its operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws and regulations, Ryanair may be subject to\nsignificant civil, criminal and administrative damages, penalties and fines, as well as reputational harm, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company faces significant price and other pressures in a highly competitive environment. Ryanair operates\nin a highly competitive marketplace, with a number of low-fare, traditional and charter airlines competing throughout its\nroute network. Airlines compete primarily in respect of fare levels, frequency and dependability of service, name\nrecognition, passenger amenities (such as access to frequent flyer programs), and the availability and convenience of\nother passenger services. Unlike Ryanair, certain competitors are state-owned or state-controlled flag carriers and in\nsome cases may have greater name recognition and resources and may have received, or may receive in the future,\nsignificant amounts of subsidies and other state aid from their respective governments as happened during the Covid-\n19 pandemic. In addition, the EU-U.S. Open Skies Agreement allows U.S. carriers to offer services in the intra-EU market,\nwhich could eventually result in increased competition in the EU market. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—\nGovernment Regulation—European Union.”\nThe airline industry is highly susceptible to price discounting, in part because airlines incur very low marginal\ncosts for providing service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats. Both low-fare and traditional airlines\nsometimes offer low fares in direct competition with Ryanair across a significant proportion of its route network as a\nresult of the liberalization of the EU air transport market and greater public acceptance of the low-fares model.\n5\nIn addition to traditional competition among airline companies and charter operators who have entered the low-\nfares market, the industry also faces competition from ground transportation (including high-speed rail systems) and\nsea transportation alternatives, as businesses and recreational travelers seek substitutes for air travel.\nAlthough Ryanair intends to assert its rights against any predatory pricing or other similar conduct, price\ncompetition both among airlines and between airlines and ground and sea transportation alternatives could reduce the\nlevel of fares and/or passenger traffic on Ryanair’s routes to the point where profitability may not be achievable.\nRyanair has a significant amount of debt and fixed obligations, and insufficient liquidity may have a material\nadverse effect on the Company’s financial condition. Ryanair carries, and will continue to carry for the foreseeable future,\na substantial amount of debt. Although the Company has historically been able to generate sufficient cash flow from\noperations to pay debt and other fixed obligations when they become due, the risks described in this report may limit\nthe Company’s ability to do so in the future and may adversely affect its overall liquidity. As a result, the Company has\nincurred and will continue to seek new financing sources to fund its operations for the unknown duration of any\neconomic recovery period. Volatility and uncertainty in the global markets generally, and the air transportation industry\nspecifically, may make it difficult for Ryanair to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all. Additionally, future\ndebt agreements may contain more restrictive covenants or require security beyond historical market terms, which may\nrestrict Ryanair’s ability to successfully access capital.\nRyanair has seasonally grounded aircraft. In prior years, in response to typically lower traffic and yields from\nNovember to March (inclusive) (“winter”), higher airport charges and/or taxes and, at times, higher fuel prices, Ryanair\nadopted a policy of grounding a certain portion of its fleet during the winter months. Ryanair carries out the majority of\nscheduled heavy maintenance during the winter months which also results in the grounding of aircraft. The Company\nintends to continue grounding aircraft in fiscal year 2025. Ryanair’s policy of seasonally grounding aircraft presents\nsome risks. While Ryanair seeks to implement its seasonal grounding policy in a way that will allow it to reduce the\nnegative impact on operating income by operating flights during periods of high oil prices to high cost airports at low\nwinter yields, there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful.\nWhile seasonal grounding does reduce Ryanair’s variable operating costs, it does not avoid fixed costs such as\naircraft ownership costs, and it also decreases Ryanair’s potential to earn revenues. Decreasing the number and\nfrequency of flights may also negatively affect Ryanair’s labor relations, including its ability to attract flight personnel\ninterested in year-round employment. Such risks could lead to negative effects on Ryanair’s financial condition and/or\nresults of operations.\nThe Company will incur significant costs acquiring new aircraft and any instability in the credit and capital markets\ncould negatively impact Ryanair’s ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms. Ryanair’s continued growth is dependent\nupon its ability to acquire additional aircraft to meet additional capacity needs and to replace older aircraft. Ryanair had\n584 aircraft in its operating fleet at March 31, 2024 and expects to receive an additional 64 Boeing 737-8200 aircraft\nbefore the end of fiscal year 2025, pursuant to a contract with the Boeing Company (“Boeing,” and such contract inclusive\nof subsequent amendments, the “2014 Boeing Contract”).\nIn May 2023 Ryanair announced that it had entered into a purchase agreement with Boeing (the “2023 Boeing\nContract”) to purchase up to 300 Boeing 737-MAX-10 series aircraft (of which 150 are firm orders and 150 are subject\nto an option exercisable at Ryanair’s discretion) for delivery between 2027 to 2033 (inclusive). This agreement was\napproved by Company’s shareholders at its AGM on September 14, 2023.\nRyanair expects to have approximately 800 narrow-body aircraft in its fleet following delivery of all the Boeing\n737-8200 and Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft, allowing for expected disposals of older aircraft, including lease returns over\nthe period and Boeing’s ability to fulfil both the 2014 and 2023 Boeing Contracts. For additional information on the\n6\nCompany’s aircraft fleet and expansion plans, see “—A majority of Ryanair’s aircraft and certain parts are sourced from\na single supplier; therefore, Ryanair would be materially and adversely affected if such supplier were unable to provide\nadditional equipment or support,” and “Item 4. Information on the Company—Aircraft” and “Item 5. Operating and\nFinancial Review and Prospects—Liquidity and Capital Resources”. There can be no assurance that this planned\nexpansion will not outpace the growth of passenger traffic on Ryanair’s routes or that traffic growth will not prove to be\ngreater than the expanded fleet can accommodate. In either case, such developments could have a material adverse\neffect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a result of the 2014 Boeing Contract and the 2023 Boeing Contract, and other general corporate purposes,\nRyanair has raised and expects to continue to raise substantial debt financing. Ryanair’s ability to raise unsecured or\nsecured debt to pay for aircraft is subject to potential volatility in the worldwide financial markets. Additionally, Ryanair’s\nability to raise unsecured or secured debt to pay for aircraft as they are delivered is subject to various conditions imposed\nby the counterparties and debt markets to such loan facilities and related loan guarantees, and any future financing is\nexpected to be subject to similar conditions. Any failure by Ryanair to comply with such conditions and any failure to\nraise necessary amounts of unsecured or secured debt to pay for aircraft, would have a material adverse effect on its\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nUsing the debt capital markets to finance the Company requires the Company to retain its investment grade\ncredit ratings (the Company has a BBB+ (stable outlook) credit rating from both S&P and Fitch Ratings). There is a risk\nthat the Group will be unable, or unwilling, to access these markets if it is downgraded or is unable to retain its investment\ngrade credit ratings and this could lead to a higher cost of finance for the Group and a material adverse effect on its\nresults and financial condition.\nRyanair has previously entered into significant derivative transactions intended to hedge some of its aircraft\nacquisition-related debt obligations. These derivative transactions expose Ryanair to certain risks and could have\nadverse effects on its results of operations and financial condition. See “Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures About Market Risk.”\nCurrency fluctuations affect the Company’s results. Although the Company is headquartered in Ireland, a\nsignificant portion of its operations are conducted in the UK. Consequently, the Group has significant operating revenues\nand operating expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, denominated in UK pounds sterling. In addition, fuel, aircraft,\ninsurance, aircraft leases and some maintenance obligations are denominated in U.S. dollars. Ryanair’s operations and\nfinancial performance can therefore be significantly affected by fluctuations in the values of the UK pound sterling and\nthe U.S. dollar. Ryanair is particularly vulnerable to direct exchange rate risks between the euro and the U.S. dollar\nbecause a significant portion of its operating costs are incurred in U.S. dollars and substantially none of its revenues are\ndenominated in U.S. dollars.\nAlthough the Company engages in foreign currency hedging transactions between the euro and the U.S. dollar\nand, from time to time, between the euro and the UK pound sterling, hedging activities are not expected to eliminate\ncurrency risks. See “Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\nProlonged delays in the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) and/or the European Union Aviation Safety Agency\n(“EASA”) issuing required certifications or approvals for the Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft could materially and adversely\naffect Ryanair’s business plans, strategy and results of operations. Pursuant to a contract with the Boeing Company,\nRyanair has ordered up to 300 new Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft (150 firm and 150 options) for delivery between 2027 to\n2033 (the “2023 Boeing Contract”). See “Item 10. Additional information – Material Contracts”.\nRyanair expects the phased deliveries of the aircraft between 2027 and 2033 will enable Ryanair to create\napproximately 10,000 new high-paid jobs for pilots, cabin crew and engineers, to facilitate disciplined traffic growth and\n7\nsupport related revenue growth, and to replace a significant portion of Ryanair’s older Boeing aircraft, supporting\nRyanair’s environmental and sustainability goals.\nThe delivery of the new aircraft under the 2023 Boeing contract is subject to the FAA and EASA issuing the\nrequired certifications and approvals to Boeing. Prolonged delays in the FAA and/or EASA issuing the required\ncertifications or approvals for the Boeing 737-MAX-10, or further regulatory actions by the FAA and/or EASA with respect\nto the Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft could also materially and adversely affect Ryanair’s business plans, strategy and\nresults of operations, and there can be no assurance that Ryanair will be able to procure and operate other types of\naircraft from Boeing or another manufacturer, seller or lessor.\nResidual value of the fleet. At March 31, 2024 Ryanair operated 584 aircraft (28 of which are leased), has a\npurchase contract in place in respect of an additional 64 Boeing 737-8200 “Gamechanger” aircraft pursuant to the 2014\nBoeing Contract, and a purchase order in respect of up to 300 Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft (of which 150 are firm orders\nand 150 are subject to an option exercisable at Ryanair’s discretion) for delivery between 2027 to 2033 (inclusive). Over\nthe course of the 2023 Boeing Contract order, Ryanair plans to dispose and handback approximately 150 aircraft as part\nof its ongoing fleet management strategy. Although under the terms of the 2023 Boeing Contract, Ryanair shall purchase\nthe new aircraft at substantial discounts to the basic price for Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft, there can be no certainty that\nthere will be demand for the new aircraft capacity or that Ryanair will be able to sell aircraft profitably at the time of\ndisposal. Failure by Ryanair to dispose of an appropriate number of aircraft could have an adverse effect on Ryanair’s\nfinancial condition.\nThe Company’s growth may expose it to risks. Ryanair’s operations have grown rapidly since it pioneered the\nlow-fares operating model in Europe in the early 1990s. Ryanair intends to continue to expand its fleet and add new\ndestinations and additional flights. In September 2021, Ryanair increased its booked passenger target to approximately\n225m passengers per annum by fiscal year 2026. Following shareholder approval of the 2023 Boeing Contract at the\nCompany’s AGM in September, 2023, this target was increased to approximately 300m passengers per annum by fiscal\nyear 2034. However, no assurance can be given that these targets will be met. If growth in passenger traffic and Ryanair’s\nrevenues do not keep pace with the planned expansion of its fleet, Ryanair could suffer from overcapacity and its results\nof operations and financial condition (including its ability to fund scheduled purchases of the new aircraft and related\ndebt repayments) could be materially adversely affected.\nThe continued expansion of Ryanair’s fleet and operations combined with other factors, may also strain existing\nmanagement resources and related operational, financial, management information and information technology\nsystems. Expansion will generally require additional skilled personnel, equipment, facilities and systems. An inability to\nhire skilled personnel or to secure required equipment and facilities efficiently and in a cost-effective manner may have\na material adverse effect on Ryanair’s ability to achieve its growth plans and sustain or increase its profitability.\nRyanair’s new routes and expanded operations may have an adverse financial impact on its results. When Ryanair\ncommences new routes, its load factors and fares tend to be lower than those on its established routes and its\nadvertising and other promotional costs tend to be higher, which may result in initial losses that could have a material\nnegative impact on Ryanair’s results of operations as well as require a substantial amount of cash to fund. In addition,\nthere can be no assurance that Ryanair’s low-fares service will be accepted on new routes. Ryanair also periodically runs\nspecial promotional fare campaigns, in particular in connection with the opening of new routes. Promotional fares may\nhave the effect of increasing load factors and reducing Ryanair’s yield and passenger revenues on such routes during\nthe periods that they are in effect. Ryanair has significant cash needs as it expands, including the cash required to fund\naircraft purchases or aircraft deposits related to the acquisition of aircraft. There can be no assurance that Ryanair will\nhave sufficient cash to make such expenditures and investments, and to the extent Ryanair is unable to expand its route\nsystem successfully, its future revenue and earnings growth will in turn be limited. See”—The Company will incur\n8\nsignificant costs acquiring new aircraft and any instability in the credit and capital markets could negatively impact\nRyanair’s ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms”.\nRyanair’s continued growth is dependent on access to suitable airports; charges for airport access are subject to\nincrease. Airline traffic at certain European airports is regulated by a system of grandfathered “slot” allocations. Each\nslot represents authorization to take-off and/or land at the particular airport at a specified time. As part of Ryanair’s\nstrategic initiatives, which include flights to primary airports, Ryanair Group airlines are operating to an increasing\nnumber of slot-coordinated airports, a number of which have constraints at particular times of the day. There can be no\nassurance that Ryanair will be able to obtain a sufficient number of slots at slot-coordinated airports that it may wish to\nserve in the future, at the time it needs them, or on acceptable terms. There can also be no assurance that its non-slot\nconstrained bases, or the other non-slot constrained airports Ryanair serves, will continue to operate without slot\nallocation restrictions in the future. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—Government Regulation—Slots.” Airports\nmay impose other operating restrictions such as curfews, limits on aircraft noise levels, mandatory flight paths, runway\nrestrictions, and limits on the number of average daily departures. Such restrictions may limit the ability of Ryanair to\nprovide service to or increase service at such airports.\nRyanair’s future growth also materially depends on its ability to access suitable airports located in its targeted\ngeographic markets at costs that are consistent with Ryanair’s strategy. Any condition that denies, limits, or delays\nRyanair’s access to airports it serves or seeks to serve in the future would constrain Ryanair’s ability to grow. A change\nin the terms of Ryanair’s access to these facilities or any increase in the relevant charges paid by Ryanair as a result of\nthe expiration or termination of such arrangements and Ryanair’s failure to renegotiate comparable terms or rates could\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. For additional\ninformation, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—Airport Operations—Airport Charges.” See also “—The Company\nis subject to legal proceedings alleging state aid at certain airports” below.\nLabor relations could expose the Company to risk. In December 2017, Ryanair announced its decision to\nrecognize trade unions for collective bargaining purposes. Since then, Ryanair Group airlines have concluded Collective\nLabor Agreements (“CLAs”) with trade unions in most of their major markets. The CLAs concluded to date vary by\ncountry but include agreements on recognition, seniority, base transfers, promotions, pay and rostering arrangements.\nThere may be a push for legacy type working conditions which, if acceded to, could decrease the productivity of crew,\nincrease costs and have an adverse effect on profitability.\nAt the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, Ryanair and its union partners negotiated agreements to protect crew\njobs via temporary pay cuts which were to be gradually restored from 2022 to 2025. In fiscal year 2023, Ryanair Group\nairlines concluded agreements with their people and unions, in the majority of countries, which accelerated pay\nrestoration with pay fully restored in December 2022. Further negotiations have taken place through fiscal year 2024\nwith agreements now in place in all major markets to 2026 or 2027 with set annual pay increases. Whilst these\nagreements set pay and conditions for the coming years, high inflation in the general economy, a global recession and\na shift in market conditions could lead to unrealistic expectations by trade unions and excessive pay demands that could\nlead to labor unrest.\nRyanair intends to retain its low-fare, high people productivity model; however, there may be periods of labor\nunrest as unions challenge the existing high people productivity model which may have an adverse effect on customer\nsentiment and profitability.\nRyanair has transitioned from Irish to local contracts of employment in a number of EU countries which has\nimpacted costs, productivity and complexity of the business. Any subsequent decision to switch to lower cost locations\ncould result in redundancies and a consequent deterioration in labor relations.\n9\nThe Group is dependent on external service providers. Ryanair currently assigns its engine overhauls and\n“rotable” repairs to outside contractors approved under the terms of Part 145, the European regulatory standard for\naircraft maintenance (“Part 145”) established by EASA. The Company also assigns its passenger, aircraft, and ground\nhandling services at airports (other than Dublin and certain airports in Poland, Spain and Portugal) to established external\nservice providers. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—Maintenance and Repairs—Heavy Maintenance” and “Item\n4. Information on the Company—Airport Operations—Airport Handling Services.”\nThe termination or expiration of any of Ryanair’s service contracts or any inability to renew them or negotiate\nreplacement contracts with other service providers at competitive rates could have a material adverse effect on the\nGroup’s results of operations. Ryanair will need to enter into airport service agreements in any new markets it enters,\nand there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain the necessary facilities and services at competitive rates. In\naddition, although Ryanair seeks to monitor the performance of external parties that provide passenger and aircraft\nhandling services, the efficiency, timeliness, and quality of contract performance by external providers are largely beyond\nRyanair’s direct control. Ryanair expects to be dependent on such outsourcing arrangements for the foreseeable future.\nThe Group is dependent on key personnel. Ryanair’s success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts\nand abilities of its senior management team, including Michael O’Leary, the Group CEO, and key financial, commercial,\noperating, IT, ESG, HR and maintenance personnel. See “Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees—\nCompensation of Directors and Executive Officers—Remuneration Agreement with Mr. O’Leary.” Ryanair’s success also\ndepends on the ability of its Executive Officers and other members of senior management to operate and manage\neffectively, both independently and as a Group. Although Ryanair’s employment agreements with Mr. O’Leary and several\nof its other Senior Executives contain non-competition and non-disclosure provisions, there can be no assurance that\nthese provisions will be enforceable in whole or in part. Competition for highly qualified personnel is intense, and either\nthe loss of any executive officer, senior manager, or other key employee without adequate replacement or the inability\nto attract new, qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect upon Ryanair’s business, operating results, and\nfinancial condition.\nEntry into service of the Boeing 737-8200. Ryanair has 210 Boeing 737-8200 aircraft on firm order from Boeing.\nThese aircraft were originally due to commence delivery in April 2019. During fiscal year 2021, the FAA and EASA\napproved the ungrounding of the MAX and approved Ryanair’s variant the Boeing 737-8200. Ryanair received the first\naircraft in June 2021. At March 31, 2024 the Ryanair Group had taken delivery of 146 Boeing 737-8200s. The remaining\n64 aircraft are scheduled to be delivered before the end of fiscal year 2025.\nThere can be no assurance that the FAA and/or EASA will not, now or in the future, apply additional maintenance\nor oversight in relation to the operation of the Boeing 737-8200 aircraft, that will delay delivery of these aircraft and/or\nmaterially increase the cost of operating this aircraft type.\nThe Company faces risks related to its internet reservations operations and its elimination of airport check-in\nfacilities. Ryanair’s flight reservations are made through its website, mobile app and Global Distribution Systems\nincluding Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport (which operates the Galileo and Worldspan GDS) (collectively, the “GDSs”).\nRyanair has established contingency programs which include migrating its website to the cloud and having a back-up\nbooking engine available to support its existing booking platform in the event of a breakdown in this facility. Nonetheless,\nthe process of switching over to the back-up booking engine could take some time and there can be no assurance that\nRyanair would not suffer a significant loss of reservations in the event of a major breakdown of its booking engine or\nother related systems.\nAll Ryanair passengers are required to use Internet check-in. Internet check-in is part of a package of measures\nintended to reduce check-in lines and passenger handling costs and pass on these savings by reducing passenger\nairfares. Ryanair has deployed this system across its network. Any disruptions to the Internet check-in service as a result\n10\nof a breakdown in the relevant computer systems or otherwise could have a material adverse impact on these service-\nimprovement and cost-reduction efforts. There can be no assurance, however, that this process will continue to be\nsuccessful or that consumers will not switch to other carriers that provide standard check-in facilities, which would\nnegatively affect Ryanair’s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to legal proceedings alleging state aid at certain airports. Formal investigations by the\nEuropean Commission are ongoing into Ryanair’s agreements with Carcassonne, Girona, Reus, Târgu Mures and Beziers\nairports, Ryanair’s agreements since 2009 with Frankfurt (Hahn) airport, and Ryanair’s arrangements with Cagliari airport\n(even though the Commission in March 2023 withdrew its 2016 finding that Ryanair had received aid through those\narrangements). The investigations seek to determine whether the agreements constitute illegal state aid under EU law.\nThe investigations are currently expected to be completed in 2024, with the European Commission’s decisions being\nappealable to the EU General Court. Investigations into Ryanair’s agreements with the Bratislava, Tampere, Marseille,\nBerlin (Schönefeld), Aarhus, Dusseldorf (Weeze), Brussels (Charleroi), Alghero, Stockholm (Västerås), Lübeck, Riga and\nParis (Beauvais) airports, and into Ryanair’s agreements prior to 2009 with Frankfurt (Hahn), have concluded with\nfindings that these agreements contained no state aid. In parallel, the European Commission has announced findings\nof state aid to Ryanair in its arrangements with Pau, Nimes, Angouleme, Altenburg, Zweibrücken, Cagliari, Klagenfurt,\nMontpellier and La Rochelle airports, ordering Ryanair to repay a total of approximately €40m of alleged state aid.\nRyanair has appealed these “aid” decisions to the EU General Court, which ruled in favor of Ryanair in the Zweibrücken\nairport case. In 2023, the European Commission withdrew its “aid” (approximately €12m) decision concerning Ryanair’s\narrangements with Cagliari airport, following a General Court ruling in a related case, and is currently reviewing the case\nafresh in light of the guidance received from the Court, with a decision expected in 2024. The EU General Court ruled in\nfavor of the European Commission in the cases of Pau, Nimes, Angouleme, Altenburg, Montpellier and Klagenfurt. The\nKlagenfurt judgment was subject to an appeal by Ryanair to the European Court of Justice which ruled against Ryanair\nin 2023. Ryanair’s appeal to the European Court of Justice in the Montpellier case is expected to conclude in 2024. In\naddition to the European Commission investigations, Ryanair is facing an allegation that it has benefited from unlawful\nstate aid in a German court case launched by Lufthansa in 2006 in relation to Ryanair’s arrangements with Frankfurt\n(Hahn). Adverse rulings in the above state aid matters could be used as precedents by competitors to challenge\nRyanair’s agreements with other publicly owned airports and could cause Ryanair to strongly reconsider its growth\nstrategy in relation to public or state-owned airports across Europe. This could in turn lead to a scaling-back of Ryanair’s\noverall growth strategy due to the smaller number of privately-owned airports available for development.\nNo assurance can be given as to the outcome of these legal proceedings, nor as to whether any unfavorable\noutcomes may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial\ncondition of Ryanair.\nFor additional information, please see “Item 8. Financial Information—Other Financial Information—Legal\nProceedings.”\nThe Company faces risks related to unauthorized use of information from the Company’s website. Screen scraper\nwebsites gain unauthorized access to Ryanair’s website and booking system, extract flight and pricing information and\ndisplay it on their own websites for sale to customers at prices which may include hidden intermediary fees on top of\nRyanair’s fares. Ryanair does not allow any such commercial use of its website and objects to the practice of screen\nscraping also on the basis of certain legal principles, such as contractual and database rights and copyright protection.\nIn turn, Ryanair has been accused by certain operators of screen scraping websites that its objection to the unauthorized\nselling by online travel agents (OTAs) to consumers of Ryanair flight tickets is an attempt to restrict competition. Ryanair\nis currently involved in legal proceedings against the proprietors of screen scraper websites in Germany, Ireland, France,\nItaly, and the U.S. Ryanair’s objective is to prevent any unauthorized use of its website and to prevent consumer harm,\nand the resultant reputational damage to the Company, that may arise due to the failure by some operators of screen\nscraper websites to provide Ryanair with the passengers’ genuine contact and payment method details.\n11\nIn November 2023, the Irish High Court found that Flightbox, a screen scraper, was bound by the Terms of Use\nof the Ryanair website and as such, the court granted Ryanair a permanent injunction prohibiting Flightbox from\nbreaching the binding Terms of Use of the Ryanair website by using bot technology to unlawfully scrape the Ryanair\nwebsite for OTAs. Following that decision, Ryanair was approached by a number of OTAs who wanted to enter into\nagreements that respected Ryanair’s exclusive online distribution model. Ryanair entered into the first Direct Distribution\nAgreement (DDA) with Love Holidays in January 2024 and subsequently into DDAs with several other OTAs. The DDAs\nfully protect Ryanair’s exclusive online distribution model. Under the DDAs Ryanair grants the OTA partner a licence to\nuse its flight and price data for display purposes only on the OTA website. The passenger can select accurately priced\nRyanair flights and ancillary products, and is brought to the Ryanair.com website to sign into their myRyanair account\nand confirm their Ryanair booking. The agreement strictly prohibits any hidden mark-ups being applied to Ryanair flights\nand/or ancillary products so as not to mislead consumers. It ensures that Ryanair obtains the passenger’s real contact\ndetails, allows the passenger to manage their own booking directly with Ryanair, and in the event of cancellation or\ndisruption that the passenger receives a prompt refund.\nIn January 2024, the Milan Court of Appeal conclusively rejected claims of the OTAs Lastminute and Viaggiare\nthat Ryanair’s exclusive online distribution model constitutes an abuse of a dominant position and confirmed that\nRyanair’s exclusive online distribution model was justified and pro-consumer.\nRyanair also allows certain companies who operate fare comparison (i.e., not reselling) websites to access its\nschedule and fare information for the purposes of price comparison provided they sign a license and use the agreed\nmethod to access the data. In addition, Ryanair permits GDS operators Amadeus, Sabre, Travelport (trading as Galileo\nand Worldspan) and Kyte to provide access to Ryanair’s fares to traditional brick & mortar travel agents and closed\ncorporate travel booking platforms.\nNotwithstanding the recent success in the screen scraping litigation, Ryanair has also in the past recorded\nunfavorable rulings in its actions against screen scrapers. Pending the outcome of outstanding legal proceedings and\ninvestigations by competition authorities (including the investigation launched by the Italian Competition Authority in\nSeptember 2023) and if Ryanair were to be ultimately unsuccessful in them, the activities of screen scraper websites\ncould lead to a reduction in the number of customers who book directly on Ryanair’s website and consequently to a\nreduction in Ryanair’s ancillary revenue stream. Also, some business may be lost to Ryanair once potential customers\nare presented by a screen scraper website with a Ryanair fare or a fee for an ancillary product such as priority boarding\nor checked baggage inflated by the screen scraper’s intermediary fee. This could also adversely affect Ryanair’s\nreputation as a low-fares airline, which could negatively affect Ryanair’s results of operations and financial conditions.\nFor additional details, see “Item 8. Financial Information—Other Financial Information—Legal Proceedings—\nLegal Proceedings Against Internet Ticket Touts.”\nThe Company is subject to increasingly strict sanctions for non-compliance with consumer protection laws.\nDespite the Company’s efforts to ensure full compliance with applicable consumer protection laws, there is a risk that\ngovernment bodies or other entities might claim non-compliance with these laws by Ryanair. Should any non-compliance\nbe established, the Company could face substantial repercussions, including compliance order, fines and damages, as\nwell as negative publicity. Such events could significantly impact Ryanair's business operations, financial condition, and\noperational results. See also: “Item 4. Information on the Company—Government Regulation—Consumer Protection.”\nThe Company faces risks related to allegations of non-compliance with competition law. Ryanair is subject to\nlaws and regulations relating to anti-competitive practices in the European Union, individual members states and other\ncountries in which it operates. In December 2022, the Italian Competition Authority (‘AGCM’) formulated an allegation of\nprice collusion against Ryanair and several other airlines on routes between mainland Italy and Sicily during the\nChristmas travel peak. There was no merit behind this allegation and Ryanair believes that the AGCM was motivated by\n12\npolitical pressure rather than any credible indication of existence of a cartel. Consequently, the AGCM dropped its\ninvestigation in November 2023. Also in November 2023, the AGCM launched a sector inquiry on pricing algorithms for\nair passengers on routes to and from Sicily and Sardinia. This inquiry is pending. The AGCM has the power to impose\nbehavioural or structural measures on companies to eliminate distortions of competition or to recommend\nlegislative/regulatory changes to improve the functioning of the markets. In September 2023, the AGCM opened an\ninvestigation into a potential abuse of a dominant position by Ryanair in its dealings with OTAs and bricks & mortar\ntravel agents. In the context of this investigation, in April 2024 the AGCM started interim proceedings to determine\nwhether there exists a risk of irreparable damage to competition during the time required for completing the main\ninvestigation, unless interim measures are imposed on the Company. The AGCM closed these interim proceedings in\nlate May 2024, concluding that there was no basis for the adoption of precautionary measures pending the outcome of\nthe main investigation. Ryanair believes there is no merit in this investigation and is fully defending its position with\nreference to, amongst others, case law supporting its current distribution model, including January 2024 rulings of the\nCourt of Appeal of Milan in cases brought by OTAs Lastminute and Viaggiare, which found that Ryanair’s direct\ndistribution model benefited consumers and did not entail an abuse of a dominant position. However, it cannot be\nguaranteed that the AGCM will reach the same conclusions as the Milan Court of Appeal and the Company may therefore\nface a finding of an abuse of a dominant position and potentially a fine, which it would appeal in court. As the Company\nhas grown to become the largest airline in Europe by passenger traffic and number of daily flights, these recent\ninvestigations may turn out to be the beginning of a trend of competition authorities or other parties (such as suppliers)\nseeking to build cases based on allegations of breaches of EU and national laws prohibiting cartels and abuses of\ndominance. Competition authorities have extensive powers to impose structural or behavioural measures as well as\nfines of up to 10% of global annual turnover. The Company intends to fully defend any such claims, however, no\nassurance can be given as to the outcome of any such proceedings.\nCorporation tax rates are expected to rise. The Company is principally subject to corporation tax on profits across\na number of European jurisdictions from which its airlines are managed and controlled (i.e. Ireland, Malta, Poland, and\nthe UK). In December 2022, the Council of the European Union (‘EU’) reached unanimous agreement to adopt the EU\nCommission’s directive relating to the OECD’s inclusive framework on BEPS Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules\n(referred to as “GloBE” or “Pillar Two”). The directive requires EU member states to enact a minimum global corporate\ntax rate of 15% for multinational groups. On foot of this directive, Ireland has enacted tax laws that will, as a backstop,\napply a ‘top-up tax’ to the Company to ensure that the Group as a whole, meets to the minimum global corporation tax\nrate standard outlined in the Pillar Two rules. These laws are subject to the continuing development of administrative\nguidelines by the OECD and contain various transitional reliefs. These rules are expected to increase the overall effective\ntax rate of the Company from fiscal year 2025 onwards.\nAny increase in corporation tax rates to which the Company is exposed or adverse changes in the basis of\ncalculation would result in the Company paying higher corporation taxes and could have an adverse impact on Ryanair’s\ncash flows, financial position, and results of operations.\nChanges in EU regulations in relation to employers and employee social insurance could increase costs. European\nlegislation governs the country in which employees and employers must pay social insurance costs. Under the terms of\nlegislation introduced in 2012, employees and employers must pay social insurance in the country where the employee\nis based. Prior to June 2012, Ryanair paid employee and employer social insurance in the country under whose laws the\nemployee’s contract of employment was governed, which was either the UK or Ireland. Each country within the EU has\ndifferent rules and rates in relation to the calculation of employee and employer social insurance contributions and any\nincrease in the rates of contributions will have a material adverse effect on Ryanair’s cash flows, financial position, and\nresults of operations.\nRyanair is subject to tax audits. The Company operates in many jurisdictions and is, from time to time, subject\nto tax audits, which by their nature are often complex and can require several years to conclude. While the Company is\n13\nof the view that it is tax compliant in all jurisdictions in which it operates, there can be no guarantee, particularly in the\ncurrent economic environment, that it will not receive tax assessments following the conclusion of the tax audits. In the\nevent that the Company is unsuccessful in defending its position, it is possible that the effective tax rate, employment\nand other costs of the Company could materially increase. See “—Corporation tax rates expected to rise” above.\nThe Company faced legal challenges by regulatory authorities and consumers due to delays in the processing of\ncash refunds during the Covid-19 pandemic and its policy of offering travel vouchers in lieu of cash refunds in the interim.\nIn the initial stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, and in light of staff shortages due to lockdown restrictions and an\nunprecedented high rate of flight cancellations, Ryanair offered travel vouchers to passengers who claimed\nreimbursement. This policy was in line with the requirements of the ‘European Commission’s Recommendation (EU)\n2020/648 of May 13, 2020 on vouchers offered to passengers and travelers as an alternative to reimbursement for\ncancelled package travel and transport services in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic’, in which the Commission\nrecognized airlines’ right to offer travel vouchers as long as the offer does not affect passengers’ right to opt for a cash\nrefund instead.\nNational authorities responsible for the enforcement of EU Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004 (the “Regulation”) and\nthe European Commission’s Consumer Protection Cooperation Network generally recognized Ryanair’s efforts and\naccepted that the seven days’ deadline provided for by the Regulation to process refunds was to be interpreted in a\nreasonable manner in light of the circumstances of the Covid-19 crisis. While some consumer protection enforcement\nauthorities or courts may ultimately find Ryanair’s decision to encourage passengers to accept travel vouchers in lieu of\na cash refund to amount to a breach of the Regulation and/or an unfair commercial practice, the Company does not\nconsider that such findings would have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition of\nRyanair.\nBrexit’s effect on Ryanair’s business. The UK’s exit from the European Union on January 31, 2020 has had a\nsignificant impact on the UK and the EU. The UK and the EU announced on December 24, 2020 that they had signed a\nTrade and Cooperation Agreement (the “EU–UK TCA”). The EU–UK TCA covers a wide range of topics, including trade\nin goods and in services, digital trade, intellectual property, public procurement, aviation and road transport, energy,\nfisheries, social security coordination, law enforcement and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, and thematic\ncooperation and participation in EU programs.\nThe current and future arrangements between the EU and the UK, including the EU–UK TCA, could directly impact\nRyanair’s business in a number of ways. They include, inter alia, the status of the UK in relation to the EU’s open air\ntransport market, freedom of movement between the UK and the EU, and employment, social security, tax and customs\nrules between the UK and the EU. Adverse changes to any of these arrangements could potentially materially impact on\nRyanair’s financial condition and results of operations in the UK or other markets Ryanair serves.\nAs a result of the EU–UK TCA, flights between the UK and the EU can be offered by any of the Company’s airline\nsubsidiaries. UK domestic flights and flights between the UK and non-EU destinations can, however, only be offered by\nthe Company’s UK subsidiary, Ryanair UK Limited (“Ryanair UK”), which received an Air Operator Certificate and\nOperating License (“UK AOC”) from the UK Civil Aviation Authority (“UK CAA”) in December 2018.\nRyanair is exposed to Brexit-related risks and uncertainties, as approximately 22% of revenue in fiscal year 2024\ncame from operations in the UK, although this was offset somewhat by approximately 15% of Ryanair’s non-fuel costs\nin fiscal year 2024 which were related to operations in the UK.\nBrexit could present Ryanair with a number of other potential regulatory challenges. Brexit could lead to\npotentially divergent laws and regulations as the UK continues to determine which EU laws (including, but not limited to,\nin respect of aviation safety and security, consumer rights, data protection, public health and the environment) that it\n14\ninitially replicated on its exit from the EU to ultimately amend or abolish. It also requires special efforts to ensure\nRyanair’s continuing compliance with EU Regulation No. 1008/2008, which requires that air carriers registered in an EU\nmember state be majority-owned and effectively controlled by EU nationals. The Board of Directors has taken action to\nensure continuing compliance with EU Regulation No. 1008/2008 after December 31, 2020, i.e., the date following which\nUK holders of the Company’s shares are no longer treated as EU nationals for the purposes of EU regulation No.\n1008/2008. For additional information, please see “–Risks Related to Ownership of the Company’s Ordinary Shares or\nADRs”.\nBrexit has caused, and may continue to cause, both significant volatility in global stock markets and currency\nexchange rate fluctuations, as well as create significant uncertainty among UK businesses and investors, mainly due to\nthe resulting legal and regulatory uncertainty, including potentially divergent treaties, laws and regulations applicable to\nthe provision of air transportation services. In particular, to March 31, 2024, the pound sterling had lost approximately\n15% and 11% of its value against the U.S. Dollar and the euro respectively since the Brexit referendum in 2016. Further,\nthe Bank of England and other observers have warned of a significant probability of a Brexit-related recession in the UK,\nwhich may be further impacted by the long-term negative economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia’s invasion\nof Ukraine, increased interest rates and inflation. The Company earns a significant portion of its revenues in pounds\nsterling, and any significant decline in the value of the pound sterling and/or recession in the UK would materially impact\nits financial condition and results of operations. For fiscal year 2025, taking account of timing differences between the\nreceipt of sterling denominated revenues and the payment of sterling denominated costs, Ryanair estimates that every\n1 pence sterling movement in the €/£ exchange rate will impact net income by approximately €23m. For additional\ninformation, please see “–Currency fluctuations affect the Company’s results”.\nRisks associated with the euro. The Company is headquartered in Ireland and its reporting currency is the euro.\nGenerally, fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, cannot be predicted by us and can significantly\naffect the value of our assets located or revenues generated outside of the Eurozone. As a result of the UK’s Brexit\nreferendum in 2016, the pound sterling increased in volatility against the euro and could become more volatile over the\ncourse of the post-transition period.\nRyanair Group airlines predominantly operate to/from countries within the Eurozone and have significant\noperational and financial exposures to the Eurozone that could result in a reduction in the operating performance of\nRyanair or the devaluation of certain assets. Ryanair has taken certain risk management measures to minimize any\ndisruptions; however, these risk management measures may be insufficient. The Company has cash and aircraft assets\nand debt liabilities that are denominated in euro on its balance sheet. In addition, the positive/negative mark-to-market\nvalue of derivative-based transactions are recorded in euro as either assets or liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet.\nUncertainty regarding the future of the Eurozone could have a materially adverse effect on the value of these assets and\nliabilities. In addition to the assets and liabilities on Ryanair’s balance sheet, the Company has a number of cross-\ncurrency risks as a result of the jurisdictions of the operating business including non-euro revenues, fuel costs, certain\nmaintenance costs and insurance costs. A strengthening in the value of the euro, primarily against UK pound sterling\nand other non-Eurozone currencies such as Polish zloty or a weakening against the U.S. dollar, could have a material\nadverse impact on the operating results of the Company.\nRecession, inflation, austerity, changes in monetary policy and uncertainty in connection with the euro could\nalso mean that Ryanair is unable to grow.\n15\nRisks Related to the Airline Industry\nThe airline industry is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions: a continued recessionary\nenvironment would negatively impact Ryanair’s results of operations. Ryanair’s operations and the airline industry in\ngeneral are sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Unfavorable economic conditions such as government\nausterity measures, the longer-term impact of Covid-19 (or any future pandemics), the uncertainty relating to the\nEurozone and the UK following Brexit, geopolitical tensions, economic instability as a consequence of the conflicts in\nUkraine and Israel/Hamas, high unemployment rates, high interest rates, constrained credit markets and continuing\ninflationary pressures could lead to reduced spending by both leisure and business passengers. Unfavorable economic\nconditions also tend to impact Ryanair’s ability to raise fares to counteract increased fuel and other operating costs. A\ncontinued recessionary and/or inflationary environment, combined with austerity measures by European governments,\nrestricted or less accommodative monetary policies, uncertainties resulting from Brexit and uncertainties, sanctions,\ntrade and travel restrictions and fuel and gas shortages resulting from the conflicts in Ukraine and Israel/Hamas, has\nnegatively impacted and will likely continue to negatively impact Ryanair’s operating results. It could also restrict the\nCompany’s ability to grow passenger volumes, secure new airports and launch new routes and bases, and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on its financial results. See “—Geopolitical uncertainties and an increase of trade restrictions\nand protectionism could have a material adverse effect on Ryanair’s business, results of operation and financial\ncondition” below.\nThe introduction of government/environmental taxes or prohibitions on travel could damage Ryanair’s ability to\ngrow and could have a material adverse impact on operations. Travel taxes are levied on a per passenger basis in a\nnumber of Ryanair markets. For example, in the UK, Air Passenger Duty (APD) is charged at £13 per adult international\npassenger. In Germany there is an air passenger tax of €15.53 and similar taxes exist in Netherlands (€29.05), Morocco\n(MAD100), Sweden (SEK 76), Hungary (€10 on short-haul traffic) and Italy (municipal taxes of €6.50, Rome at €7.50,\nVenice Marco Polo at €9) amongst others. These taxes are levied as a flat amount per departing passenger and account\nfor a higher percentage when applied to low fares. In Ryanair’s experience the imposition of travel taxes reduces the\ngrowth potential of a market as fares do not increase by the amount of the tax. In most markets, transfer passengers\nare exempt from these taxes and as a result they distort the market by giving an unfair subsidy to inefficient high-cost\nairlines who operate connecting flight networks. For example, in 2022, Belgium introduced a tax on departing passengers\nwith an exemption for transfer passengers.\nThe introduction of government taxes on travel has had a negative impact on passenger volumes, particularly\ngiven the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic within the industry. The introduction of further government taxes on travel\nacross Europe could have a material adverse effect on Ryanair’s financial results.\nIn 2021, a law was passed in France prohibiting domestic flights where an alternative direct train service\noperates in under 2.5 hours, with an exception made for connecting flights. The European Commission found this\ndistorted competition between point to point carriers and network operators. Consequently, France amended the law to\nremove this exemption for connecting flights. The new formulation of the law de facto means that only 3 routes to Paris\nOrly airport are affected. The European Commission approved this law in December 2022.\nWhile management believes that any such restriction of airlines’ commercial freedom would be incompatible\nwith EU law, it cannot be guaranteed that some form of government intervention in airline ticket prices will not be\nintroduced at a national or European level. This would severely impact the Company’s ability to attract the most price\nsensitive consumers.\nIn July 2021, the European Commission announced details of the proposed “Fit for 55” legislation. These\nproposals include the introduction of a jet fuel tax on intra-EU flights through the Energy Taxation Directive. This tax\nwould potentially be fully phased in over a 10-year period to 2033. The proposal remains under discussion within the\n16\nEuropean Council. The introduction of this tax on intra-EU flights could have a material adverse effect on Ryanair’s\nfinancial results.\nEnvironmental Regulation will increase costs. Many aspects of Ryanair’s operations are subject to increasingly\nstringent national and international laws, regulations and levies protecting the environment, including those relating to\ncarbon emissions, clean water, management of hazardous materials and climate change. Compliance with existing and\nfuture environmental laws, regulations and levies can require significant expenditures, and violations can lead to\nsignificant fines, penalties and reputational damage.\nIn particular, the EU Emissions Trading System (“ETS”), is a cap-and-trade system for CO2 emissions to\nencourage industries to improve their CO2 efficiency. Under the current legislation, airlines are granted initial CO2\nallowances based on historical performance and a CO2 efficiency benchmark. Under the “Fit for 55” legislation, the EU\nETS allowances will be phased out over the period from 2024 to 2026. Any shortage of allowances has to be purchased\nin the open market and/or at government auctions. The cost of such allowances increased significantly during the last\n4 years. ETS compliance is the most material environmental compliance cost for the Group (see page F-26 for details).\nThere can be no assurance that Ryanair will be able to obtain sufficient carbon credits or that the cost of the credits will\nnot have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, operating results, and financial condition.\nAdditionally, the European Commission “ReFuel EU” regulation provides for a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”)\nblending mandate to be implemented. It sets SAF targets of 2% by 2025 rising to 6% by 2030 and 20% by 2035. There\ncan be no assurance that sufficient SAF will be available in the market for Ryanair to purchase or that the cost of SAF\nwill not have a material adverse effect on Ryanair’s financial results.\nThe Group continues to monitor developments in the setting of UK policies to deliver net zero aviation by 2050\n(“Jet Zero”) which could potentially include similar measures to the Fit for 55 legislation i.e. SAF blending mandates and\nremoval of free ETS allowances.\nGeopolitical uncertainties and an increase of trade restrictions and protectionism could have a material adverse\neffect on Ryanair’s business, results of operation and financial condition. In response to the war in Ukraine launched by\nRussia in February 2022, the EU, the UK, the U.S., and other countries have introduced extensive sanctions on Russia (as\nwell as Belarus for its role in Russia’s invasion) comprised of targeted, restrictive measures on certain individuals and\nentities, export controls, as well as general restrictions on economic relations, trade and financial transactions relating\nto Russia and Belarus. In response, Russia has imposed countermeasures against “unfriendly” states and individuals\nand entities of such states. Such sanctions and countermeasures have had, and are expected to continue to have, a\nsignificant disruptive effect on global markets, including oil and gas markets, accessibility of airports and associated\ntravel routes, as well as supply chains, including aircraft components. Geopolitical events, including the escalation or\nexpansion of hostilities in the conflict in Ukraine, may lead to further trade restrictions and instability across Europe and\nworldwide.\nIn addition, the imposition of tariffs on certain imported products by the U.S. and subsidies provided to U.S.\ncompanies have triggered retaliatory actions or threats of retaliatory actions from certain foreign governments and may\ntrigger retaliatory actions by other foreign governments, potentially resulting in a “trade war”. Certain foreign\ngovernments have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods. Others are considering\nthe imposition of sanctions that will deny U.S. companies access to critical raw materials.\nThe above geopolitical and trade uncertainty and tensions have resulted in price increases of goods and services\nglobally that may affect Ryanair which has exposure, either directly or indirectly, to the availability and cost of certain\nraw materials, including steel and titanium used for aircraft and spare parts it purchases and jet fuel. Sanctions, trade\nwars between certain countries or blocks of countries, or other governmental action, including retaliatory measures,\n17\nrelated to tariffs or international trade agreements, could have a material adverse effect on demand for Ryanair’s\nservices, its costs, customers, suppliers and/or the Irish, EU, UK, U.S. or world economy or certain sectors thereof and,\nin turn, Ryanair’s business and financial results.\nAny significant outbreak of any airborne disease or similar public health threat and related governmental, private\nsector and individual consumer responsive actions, could significantly damage Ryanair’s business, operating results and\nfinancial condition. Public health emergencies, epidemics or pandemics such as in relation to the outbreaks of Covid-19,\nswine flu, MERS, SARS, foot-and-mouth disease or avian flu have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact\non our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. A severe outbreak of new (vaccine-resistant)\nvariants of these, other airborne contagious diseases or another pandemic, may result in European or national\nauthorities imposing or re-imposing restrictions and recommending precautions to mitigate the health crisis. Such\nconstraints could include, but are not limited to, restrictions on travel, quarantine requirements, enhanced aircraft\ncleaning and additional procedures to limit transmission among personnel and customers which, on an individual or\ncombined basis, could negatively impact Ryanair’s business.\nIf any such outbreak or other public health threat becomes severe in Europe, its effect on demand for air travel\nin the markets in which Ryanair operates could be material, and it could therefore have a significantly adverse effect on\nthe Company’s financial performance. Negative publicity regarding such an outbreak or public health threat in Europe\nand other regions of the world may also have an adverse impact on demand for air travel in the markets in which Ryanair\noperates. A serious outbreak or other public health threat could therefore severely disrupt Ryanair’s business, resulting\nin the cancellation or loss of bookings, adversely affecting Ryanair’s financial condition and results of operations.\nEU Regulation on passenger compensation could significantly increase related costs. EU Regulation (EC) No.\n261/2004 requires airlines to compensate passengers (holding a valid ticket) who have been denied boarding or whose\nflight has been canceled or delayed more than three hours on arrival. The regulation calls for compensation of €250,\n€400, or €600 per passenger, depending on the length of the flight and the cause of the cancellation or delay, i.e., whether\nit is caused by “extraordinary circumstances”. As Ryanair’s average flight length is less than 1,500 KM – the upper limit\nfor short-haul flights – the amount payable is generally €250 per passenger. Passengers subject to flight delays over\ntwo hours are also entitled to “assistance”, including meals, drinks, and telephone calls, as well as hotel accommodation\nif the delay extends overnight. For delays of over five hours, the airline is also required to offer the option of a refund of\nthe cost of the unused ticket. There can be no assurance that the Company will not incur a significant increase in costs\nin the future due to the impact of this regulation if Ryanair experiences a large number of delays or canceled flights,\nwhich could occur as a result of certain types of events beyond its control. Further, courts in several jurisdictions have\nbeen narrowing the definition of the term “extraordinary circumstances”, thus allowing increased consumer claims for\ncompensation. In September 2015, the Court of Justice of the EU, in Van der Lans v KLM, held that airlines are required\nto provide compensation to passengers even in the event of a flight cancellation on account of unforeseen technical\ndefects. Further, in April 2018, the Court of Justice of the EU found in Krusemann v TUIfly that “wildcat” strikes which\nstem from restructuring measures taken by an air carrier do not constitute extraordinary circumstances. In March 2021,\nin the Airhelp v SAS proceedings, the Court of Justice of the EU effectively imposed strict liability on airlines to pay\ncompensation where flights are canceled or delayed for three hours or more on arrival due to strikes by airline staff. In\naddition, in December 2021, in joined cases (including Azurair, Corendon Airlines, Eurowings, Austrian Airlines and\nLaudamotion), the Court of Justice of the EU found that compensation is also payable for schedule changes made\nwithout sufficient notice which result in an earlier departure of one hour or more or a later departure of three hours or\nmore unless due to ‘extraordinary circumstances’. See “—Extreme Weather Events Could Affect the Company and Have\na Material Adverse Effect on the Company’s Results of Operations” below.\nUnder the terms of EU Regulation No. 261/2004, described above, in addition to the payment of compensation,\nRyanair has certain duties to passengers whose flights are canceled. In particular, Ryanair is required to reimburse\npassengers who have had their flights canceled for certain reasonable, documented expenses – primarily for\n18\naccommodation and food. Passengers must also be given a re-routing option if their flight is delayed over three hours\nor if it is canceled. Such re-routing options are not limited to Ryanair flights and other carriers must be considered if no\nsuitable Ryanair flight can be sourced. If a passenger elects for a refund, Ryanair’s re-routing obligations cease.\nSimilar passenger rights are provided in the UK under the Air Passenger Rights and Air Travel Organizers’\nLicensing (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (“UK261”) and in Israel under the Aviation Services Law (“ASL”).\nThe Company is substantially dependent on discretionary air travel. Because a substantial portion of airline travel\n(both business and personal) is discretionary and because Ryanair is substantially dependent on discretionary air travel,\nany prolonged general reduction in airline passenger traffic could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nprofitability or financial condition. Similarly, any significant increase in expenses related to security, insurance or related\ncosts could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s profitability or financial condition. As a consequence, any\nfuture aircraft safety incidents (particularly involving other low-fare airlines or aircraft models flown by Ryanair), changes\nin public opinion regarding the environmental impacts of air travel, terrorist attacks in Europe, the U.S. or elsewhere,\nsignificant military actions by the United States or EU nations, or any related economic downturn may have a material\nadverse effect on demand for air travel and thus on Ryanair’s business, operating results, and financial condition. See\n“—The Company is dependent on the continued acceptance of low-fares airlines.”\nExtreme weather events could affect the Company and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results\nof operations. In 2010 and 2011, a significant portion of the airspace over northern Europe was closed by authorities as\na result of safety concerns presented by emissions of ash from an Icelandic volcano, which resulted in the cancellation\nof a significant number of flights.\nExtreme weather events may happen again and could lead to further significant flight cancellation costs which\ncould have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the\noccurrence of such events and the resulting cancellations due to the closure of airports could also have a material\nadverse effect on the Company’s financial performance indirectly, as a consequence of changes in the public’s\nwillingness to travel within Europe due to the risk of flight disruptions.\nThe Company is dependent on the continued acceptance of low-fares airlines. In past years, accidents or other\nsafety-related incidents involving certain other low-fares airlines have had a negative impact on the public’s acceptance\nof such airlines. Any adverse event potentially relating to the safety or reliability of low-fares airlines (including accidents\nor negative reports from regulatory authorities) could adversely impact the public’s perception of, and confidence in,\nlow-fares airlines like Ryanair (regardless of Ryanair’s own safety record) and could have a material adverse effect on\nRyanair’s financial condition and results of operations. In particular, an accident or other safety-related incident involving\nan aircraft operated by another airline of the same model or manufacturer as operated by Ryanair could have a material\nadverse effect on Ryanair if such accident or other safety-related incident resulted in actions or investigations by global\naviation authorities or created a public perception that Ryanair’s operations are not safe or reliable or are less safe or\nreliable than other airlines. Such regulatory actions and/or public perceptions could, in turn, result in adverse publicity\nfor Ryanair, cause harm to Ryanair’s brand and reduce travel demand on Ryanair’s flights, resulting in a material adverse\neffect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. For additional information, see “—Risks Related\nto the Company—A majority of Ryanair’s aircraft and certain parts are sourced from a single supplier; therefore, Ryanair\nwould be materially and adversely affected if such supplier were unable to provide additional equipment or support.”\nIn addition to safety concerns, a significant increase in consumer concern regarding climate change could also\nlead to a reluctance to fly and could therefore have an adverse effect on Ryanair’s financial condition and results of\noperations.\n19\nThe Company faces the risk of loss and liability. Ryanair is exposed to potential catastrophic losses that may be\nincurred in the event of an aircraft accident or terrorist incident. Any such accident or incident could involve costs related\nto the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequent temporary or permanent loss from service. In\naddition, an accident or incident could result in significant legal claims against the Company from injured passengers\nand others who experienced injury or property damage as a result of the accident or incident, including ground victims.\nRyanair currently maintains passenger liability insurance, employer liability insurance, aircraft insurance for aircraft loss\nor damage, and other business insurance in amounts per occurrence that are consistent with industry standards.\nRyanair currently believes its insurance coverage is adequate (although not comprehensive). However, there\ncan be no assurance that the amount of insurance coverage will not need to be increased, that insurance premiums will\nnot increase significantly, or that Ryanair will not be forced to bear substantial losses from any accidents not covered\nby its insurance. Airline insurance costs increased dramatically following the September 2001 terrorist attacks on the\nUnited States. See “—The Company is substantially dependent on discretionary air travel” above. Substantial claims\nresulting from an accident in excess of related insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, any aircraft accident, even if fully insured, could lead\nto the public perception that Ryanair’s aircraft were less safe or reliable than those operated by other airlines, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on Ryanair’s business.\nEU Regulation No. 2027/97, as amended by Regulation No. 889/2002, governs air carrier liability. See “Item 4.\nInformation on the Company—Insurance” for details of this regulation. This regulation increased the potential liability\nexposure of air carriers such as Ryanair. Although Ryanair has extended its liability insurance to meet the requirements\nof the regulation, no assurance can be given that other laws, regulations, or policies will not be applied, modified or\namended in a manner that has a material adverse effect on Ryanair’s business, operating results, and financial condition.\nAirline industry margins are subject to significant uncertainty. The airline industry is capital intensive and is\ncharacterized by high fixed costs and by revenues that generally exhibit substantially greater elasticity than costs.\nAlthough fuel accounted for approximately 45% of total operating expenses in fiscal year 2024 and approximately 43%\nin fiscal year 2023, management anticipates that these percentages may vary significantly in future years. See “—\nChanges in fuel costs and availability affect the Company’s results” above. The operating costs of each flight do not\nvary significantly with the number of passengers flown, and therefore, a relatively small change in the number of\npassengers, fare pricing, or traffic mix could have a disproportionate effect on operating and financial results.\nAccordingly, a relatively minor shortfall from expected revenue levels could have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s growth or financial performance. See “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects.” The very low\nmarginal costs incurred for providing services to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats are also a factor in the\nindustry’s high susceptibility to price discounting. See “—The Company faces significant price and other pressures in a\nhighly competitive environment” above.\nSafety-related undertakings could affect the Company’s results. Aviation authorities in Europe and the United\nStates periodically require or recommend that airlines implement certain safety-related modifications and/or procedures\non their aircraft. In recent years, the FAA, EASA and UK CAA have required a number of such modifications and/or\nprocedures with regard to Boeing 737 aircraft, including aircraft structural inspections requiring specialized equipment\nand high frequency repeat inspections, an enhanced angle of attack system to be installed on the Boeing 737-8200\naircraft and modifications related to the structure surrounding CFM-56 engines. Ryanair’s policy is to implement any\nrequired/recommended safety modifications and procedures in accordance with FAA, EASA and UK CAA guidance in\nclose collaboration with Boeing and Airbus and as applicable to our fleet.\nIn 2019, the FAA and EASA implemented a regular inspection requirement of the aircraft pickle fork for all aircraft\nabove certain mandated cycles and this inspection requirement continues. To date, all such procedures have been\nconducted as part of Ryanair’s standard maintenance program and have not interrupted flight schedules nor required\n20\nany material increases in Ryanair’s maintenance expenses. However, there can be no assurance that the FAA and EASA\nor other regulatory authorities will not recommend or require other safety-related undertakings or that such undertakings\nwould not adversely impact Ryanair’s operating results or financial condition.\nThere also can be no assurance that new regulations will not be implemented in the future that would apply to\nRyanair’s aircraft and result in an increase in Ryanair’s cost of maintenance, delays in the delivery of aircraft or other\ncosts beyond management’s current estimates. In addition, should Ryanair’s aircraft cease to be sufficiently reliable or\nshould any public perception develop that Ryanair’s aircraft are less than completely reliable, Ryanair’s business could\nbe materially adversely affected.\nState Aid to the Company’s competitors could adversely affect its results. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic,\nseveral European governments chose to support their flag carrier airlines with State Aid through recapitalizations, loans,\nloan guarantees and other measures. As at March 31, 2024, the European Commission has authorized approximately\n€40bn in such aid to approximately 20 airlines. Ryanair believes that aid that includes a nationality condition is\ndiscriminatory and therefore unlawful under EU law and has challenged several of the European Commission’s aid\napprovals in the General Court. In the early stages of the pandemic, the General Court overturned the European\nCommission’s approvals in three cases (KLM, Condor and TAP); however, the European Commission promptly re-\napproved the same or similar quantum of aid to each of these airlines. Subsequently, the General Court upheld the\nEuropean Commission’s approvals in several other cases, some of which Ryanair appealed to the European Court of\nJustice. First judgments from the European Court of Justice were received in September 2023, where the court upheld\nthe European Commission’s approvals. In May 2023, the General Court allowed Ryanair’s appeals of State aid through\nrecapitalization to Lufthansa (from Germany) and SAS (from Sweden and Denmark), and an Italian State aid scheme\nlimited to Italian licensed airlines. In December 2023 the General Court allowed Ryanair’s appeals of State aid through\nrecapitalization to Air France (from France), and in February 2024 Ryanair’s appeal of State aid to KLM (from the\nNetherlands). The European Commission is required to take new decisions in each of these cases and may re-approve\nthe aid. The European Commission, relevant EU Member State, or relevant airline may also appeal the General Court\njudgments to the European Court of Justice (the Lufthansa General Court judgment of May 2023 and the Air France\njudgments of December 2023 are under such appeals which are likely to conclude in 2024-2025). Ryanair’s competitors\nmay use the aid to offer below cost prices in the market, which could negatively impact the Company’s business and\noperations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of the Company’s Ordinary Shares or ADRs\nEU rules impose restrictions on the ownership of Ryanair Holdings’ Ordinary Shares by Non-EU nationals, and the\nCompany has applied a ban on the purchase of Ordinary Shares by Non-EU nationals (which since January 1, 2021 includes\nUK nationals) since 2002. EU Regulation No. 1008/2008 requires that, in order to obtain and retain an operating license,\nan EU air carrier must be majority-owned and effectively controlled by EU nationals. The Board of Directors of Ryanair\nHoldings is given certain powers under Ryanair Holdings’ articles of association (the “Articles”) to take action to ensure\nthat the number of Ordinary Shares held in Ryanair Holdings by non-EU nationals (“Affected Shares”) does not reach a\nlevel that could jeopardize the Company’s entitlement to continue to hold or enjoy the benefit of any license, permit,\nconsent, or privilege which it holds or enjoys and which enables it to carry on business as an air carrier. The Directors,\nfrom time to time, set a “Permitted Maximum” on the number of the Company’s Ordinary Shares that may be owned by\nnon-EU nationals at such level as they believe will comply with EU law. The Permitted Maximum is currently set at 49.9%.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, the Directors can take action to safeguard the Company’s ability to operate by\nidentifying those Ordinary Shares, American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) or Affected Shares which give rise to the need\nto take action and treat such Ordinary Shares, the American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) evidencing such ADSs or\nAffected Shares as “Restricted Shares” (within the meaning of the Articles).\n21\nThe Board of Directors may, under certain circumstances, deprive holders of Restricted Shares of their rights to\nattend, vote at, or speak at general meetings, and/or require such holders to dispose of their Restricted Shares to an EU\nnational within 21 days (or such longer period as the Directors may consider reasonable). The Directors are also given\nthe power to transfer such Restricted Shares themselves if a holder fails to comply. In 2002, the Company implemented\nmeasures to restrict the ability of non-EU nationals to purchase Ordinary Shares, and non-EU nationals are currently\neffectively barred from purchasing Ordinary Shares and will remain so for as long as these restrictions remain in place.\nThere can be no assurance that these restrictions will ever be lifted. Additionally, these foreign ownership restrictions\ncould result in Ryanair’s exclusion from certain stock tracking indices. Any such exclusion may adversely affect the\nmarket price of the Ordinary Shares and ADRs. Since April 2012, the Company has had the necessary authorities in place\nto repurchase ADRs as part of its general authority to repurchase issued share capital in the Company. See “Item 10.\nAdditional Information—Limitations on Share Ownership by Non-EU Nationals” for a detailed discussion of restrictions\non share ownership and the current ban on Ordinary Share purchases by non-EU nationals.\nAs a result of Brexit, with effect from January 1, 2021 UK nationals ceased to qualify as EU nationals.\nConsequently, as of that date, the 2002 ban on the purchase of Ordinary Shares by non-EU nationals has applied to UK\nnationals also. In addition, in accordance with the resolutions passed by the Board of the Company on March 8, 2019,\nall Ordinary Shares and ADSs held by or on behalf of non-EU nationals (including UK nationals) are, as of January 1,\n2021, treated as “Restricted Shares”. Restricted Share Notices were issued to the registered holder(s) of each Restricted\nShare specifying that the holder(s) of such shares shall not be entitled to attend, speak at or vote at any general meeting\nof the Company for so long as those shares are treated as Restricted Shares pursuant to Article 41(J)(i) of the Articles.\nUK nationals are not required to dispose of Ordinary Shares which they purchased prior to January 1, 2021. These\nresolutions will remain in place until the Board determines that the ownership and control of the Company is no longer\nsuch that there is any risk to the airline licenses held by the Company's subsidiaries pursuant to EU Regulation No.\n1008/2008.\nHolders of Ordinary Shares are currently unable to convert those shares into ADRs. In an effort to increase the\npercentage of its share capital held by EU nationals, on June 26, 2001, Ryanair Holdings instructed The Bank of New\nYork Mellon, the depositary for its ADR program (the “Depositary”), to suspend the issuance of new ADRs in exchange\nfor the deposit of Ordinary Shares until further notice. Holders of Ordinary Shares cannot convert their Ordinary Shares\ninto ADRs during this suspension, and there can be no assurance that the suspension will ever be lifted. See also “—EU\nrules impose restrictions on the ownership of Ryanair Holdings’ Ordinary Shares by Non-EU nationals, and the Company\nhas applied a ban on the purchase of Ordinary Shares by Non-EU Nationals (which since January 1, 2021 includes UK\nnationals) since 2002”.\nThe Company’s results of operations may fluctuate significantly. The Company’s results of operations have\nvaried significantly from quarter to quarter, and management expects these variations to continue. See “Item 5.\nOperating and Financial Review and Prospects—Seasonal Fluctuations.” Among the factors causing these variations are\nthe airline industry’s sensitivity to general economic conditions, the seasonal nature of air travel, and trends in airlines’\ncosts, especially fuel costs. Because a substantial portion of airline travel (both business and personal) is discretionary,\nthe industry tends to experience adverse financial results during general economic downturns. The Company is\nsubstantially dependent on discretionary air travel.\nThe trading price of Ryanair Holdings’ Ordinary Shares and ADRs may be subject to wide fluctuations in response\nto quarterly variations in the Company’s operating results and the operating results of other airlines. In addition, the\nglobal stock markets from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that affect the market prices\nof many airline company stocks. These broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of\nthe Ordinary Shares and ADRs.\n22\nRyanair Holdings may or may not pay special dividends. Since its incorporation in 1996, Ryanair Holdings has\noccasionally declared special dividends on both its Ordinary Shares and ADRs. Ryanair Holdings’ ability to pay special\ndividends in the future will be dependent on the financial performance of the Company and there is no guarantee that\nany further special dividends will be paid. See “Item 8. Financial Information—Other Financial Information—Dividend\nPolicy”. As a holding company, Ryanair Holdings does not have any material assets other than its shares in the\nCompany’s operating airlines and in other entities within the Ryanair Holdings group.\nIncreased costs for possible future ADR and share repurchases. As the ADRs have historically traded on the\nNASDAQ Stock Market (“NASDAQ”) at a premium compared to Ordinary Shares, the inclusion of ADRs in buyback\nprograms may result in increased costs in performing share buybacks. Since fiscal year 2008 the Company has\nrepurchased shares as follows:\nYear ended March 31, No. of shares (m) Approx. cost (€m)\n2008-2021 407.7 4,525.9\n2022 — —\n2023 — —\n2024 — —\nPeriod through June 24, 2024 11.3 226.4\nTotal 419.0 4,752.3\nOn May 20, 2024, the Company announced a €700m ordinary share buyback program (including Ordinary Shares\nunderlying ADRs).\nThere is no guarantee that the Company’s current Central Securities Depository (“CSD”) will provide equivalent\nfunctionality to the Company’s previous CSD, which may adversely impact the Company and/or holders of ADRs and/or\ninterests in Ordinary Shares. Ireland does not have a domestic CSD, and Irish issuers, including Ryanair Holdings, whose\nshares are traded on Euronext Dublin have historically relied on CREST. CREST is a system which facilitated the recording\nof ownership and effecting transfers of shares in Irish incorporated companies, operated by Euroclear UK & Ireland\n(“EUI”) and authorized as a CSD in the United Kingdom.\nEU issuers are required by EU Regulation 909/2014 (“EU CSD Regulation”) to use a CSD authorized in an EU\nMember State. One of the consequences of Brexit is therefore that the CREST system is no longer authorized to act as\na CSD for Irish securities. This is because EUI became a third country CSD following Brexit and is no longer authorized\nto passport its services into Ireland pursuant to European law.\nThe Company held an Extraordinary General Meeting at which it was resolved that the Ordinary Shares of Ryanair\nHoldings would be migrated from the CREST System to the settlement system operated by Euroclear Bank SA/NV\n(“Euroclear Bank”), the CSD in Belgium, over the course of the weekend commencing March 12, 2021 (the “Migration”).\nThe Migration, involving all Irish companies listed on Euronext Dublin, was successfully completed on March 15, 2021.\nThe Euroclear Bank model is structurally different to CREST. Euroclear Bank operates an “intermediated”\nsettlement system, where legal title to shares in the issuer is held by a nominee of Euroclear Bank. Participants in\nEuroclear Bank (e.g., credit institutions, stockbrokers, investment managers) have rights in relation to these shares under\nBelgian law (Belgium being Euroclear Bank’s place of incorporation), and underlying investors hold their interests in the\nshares through their contractual relationship with a participant, or the direct or indirect counterparty of a participant.\nPrior to March 2021, the Company’s securities had not been deposited on an “intermediated” settlement basis\nand it cannot be guaranteed that the Euroclear Bank CSD will be able to continue to support the Company in respect of\nits continued compliance with EU ownership and control requirements pursuant to EU Regulation 1008/2008.\n23\nItem 4. Information on the Company\nINTRODUCTION\nRyanair Holdings was incorporated in 1996 as a holding company for Ryanair Designated Activity Company\n(“DAC”). The latter operates a low-fare, scheduled-passenger airline serving short-haul, point-to-point routes mainly\nwithin Europe. In fiscal year 2019, the Company set up Buzz, formally known as Ryanair Sun, (a Polish charter and\nscheduled passenger airline with a Polish AOC), and acquired Lauda (a Maltese wet lease provider to the Ryanair Group\nwith a Maltese AOC), and set-up Ryanair UK (with a UK AOC). In fiscal year 2020, Malta Air became the fifth airline in\nthe Ryanair Group. Each of Buzz, Lauda, Malta Air, Ryanair DAC and Ryanair UK are wholly owned airlines within the\nRyanair Group. See “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—History” for detail on the history of the\nCompany. As of March 31, 2024, the Ryanair Group had a principal fleet of 557 Boeing 737 aircraft and 27 Airbus A320\naircraft (total short-haul fleet of 584 aircraft). As of June 26, 2024, the Group offered over 3,500 short-haul flights per\nday serving approximately 235 airports across Europe. See “—Route System, Scheduling and Fares—Route System and\nScheduling” for more details of Ryanair’s route network. See “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—\nSeasonal Fluctuations” for information about the seasonality of Ryanair’s business.\nRyanair recorded a profit after taxation of €1.92bn in fiscal year 2024, as compared with a profit of €1.31bn in\nfiscal year 2023. The movement was primarily attributable to a 9% increase in traffic at higher average fares offset by\nhigher jet fuel and other operating costs. Ryanair generated an average booked passenger load factor of approximately\n94% in fiscal year 2024, compared to 93% in fiscal year 2023 and total revenue increased by 25% to €13.44bn, up from\n€10.78bn in fiscal year 2023.\nManagement believes that the market’s acceptance of Ryanair’s low-fares service is reflected in the “Ryanair\nEffect” – Ryanair’s history of stimulating significant annual passenger traffic growth on the routes where it commences\nservice. Fiscal year 2024 scheduled revenue increased 32% to €9.15bn. Traffic grew 9% to 183.7m while average fares\nrose 21% to c.€49.80, thanks to a record H1 and strong Easter in late March 2024, offset by softer than expected Q3\nfares and load factors (following the sudden, but welcome, removal of Ryanair flights from many OTA “Pirate” websites\nin early December 2023). Ancillary revenue increased 12% to €4.30bn (c.€23.40 per passenger). Total fiscal year 2024\nrevenue rose 25% to €13.44bn. Operating costs increased 22% to €11.38bn, primarily due to a 28% increase in fuel costs,\nhigher staff costs (including pay restoration, crew, engineering and handler pay rises, higher crewing ratios and pilot\nproductivity pay as Ryanair improves operational resilience) and Boeing delivery delays. More importantly, the widening\ncost gap (on a per passenger basis) between Ryanair and our EU competitors (which is further enhanced by Ryanair’s\nlow-cost financing and net interest income) remains a growing competitive advantage.\nThe address of Ryanair Holdings’ registered office is Dublin Office, Airside Business Park, Swords, County Dublin,\nK67 NY94, Ireland. The Company’s contact person regarding this Annual Report on Form 20-F is: Neil Sorahan, Group\nCFO (same address as above). The telephone number is +353-1-945-1212 and facsimile number is +353-1-945-1213.\nUnder its current Articles, Ryanair Holdings has an unlimited corporate duration.\nRyanair Holdings files annual reports, special reports, and other information with the SEC. Its SEC filings are\navailable on the SEC’s website at https://www.sec.gov. This site contains reports, proxy and information statements\nand other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. Ryanair Holdings also makes available on\nits website, free of charge, its annual reports on Form 20-F and the text of its reports on Form 6-K, including any\namendments to these reports, as well as certain other SEC filings, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are\nelectronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. Ryanair’s investor website address is https://investor.ryanair.com. The\ninformation on these websites, and any other website referenced herein, is not part of this report except as specifically\nincorporated by reference herein.\n24\nSTRATEGY\nRyanair’s objective is to establish itself as Europe’s largest scheduled passenger airline group in a disciplined\nand sustainable manner, through continued improvements and expanded offerings of its low-fares service. Ryanair\noffers low fares that generate increased passenger traffic while maintaining a continuous focus on cost-containment\nand operating efficiencies. The key elements of Ryanair’s long-term strategy are:\nLow-Fares. Ryanair’s low fares are designed to stimulate demand, particularly from fare-conscious leisure and\nbusiness travelers who might otherwise use alternative forms of transportation or choose not to travel at all. Ryanair\nsells seats on a one-way basis, thus eliminating minimum stay requirements from all travel on Ryanair scheduled\nservices. Ryanair sets fares on the basis of the demand for particular flights and by reference to the period remaining to\nthe date of departure of the flight, with higher fares typically charged on flights with higher levels of demand and for\nbookings made nearer to the date of departure. Ryanair also periodically runs special promotional fare campaigns. See\n“—Route System, Scheduling and Fares—Widely Available Low Fares” below.\nCustomer Service. Ryanair’s strategy is to deliver the best customer service performance in its peer group.\nRyanair delivers industry leading punctuality and cancelled significantly less flights in fiscal year 2024 (less than 1%)\ncompared to its peer group. Ryanair achieves this by focusing strongly on the execution of these services. Ryanair\nconducts a daily conference call with airport personnel at each of its base airports, during which the reasons for each\n“first wave” flight delay and baggage short shipment are discussed in detail and logged to ensure that the root cause is\nidentified and rectified. Subsequent (consequential) delays and short shipments are investigated by Ryanair ground\noperations personnel.\nDuring the past year, Ryanair revamped its operations control centers (“OCC”) in both Dublin and Warsaw,\nadopting a bridge structure that includes representatives from all sections of the operation. This team includes\nCustomer Service staff who represent the customer on the day of travel, specifically representing their needs in the event\nof a disruption. We continue to deliver industry leading On Time Performance (“OTP”); during fiscal year 2024, despite\nunprecedented ATC disruptions, approximately 87% of our flights arrived at their destination on time.\nAfter a successful launch of the “Day of Travel Assistant” in the Ryanair app in fiscal year 2022, Ryanair have\ncontinued to enhance the features available through this service, supporting passengers with information on gates,\nboarding times, gate closure, updated Expected Time of Departures (“ETDs”) in the event of delays, and videos explaining\nwhat is happening and what to expect next. Since the launch of the “Day of Travel Assistant” the Group has seen double\ndigit increases in our Customer Satisfaction (“CSAT”) scores from those passengers experiencing a delay, with over 70%\nof passengers very satisfied with the quality and timeliness of Ryanair’s communication.\nRyanair has an ongoing commitment to improving customer satisfaction across the customer journey and this\nis measured by regular post flight CSAT surveys and online “mystery-passenger” checks. Ryanair continues to achieve\nindustry leading results, surpassing internal targets and improving results year on year. Every passenger who flies with\nRyanair can rate their flying experience. Thanks to Ryanair’s strong Summer 2023 operational resilience, the fiscal year\n2024 CSAT score was over 85%, despite the widespread disruption caused by continued French ATC strikes and UK\nNATS system failures.\nThroughout the past year, we continued the success of the “We’re Listening” initiative first launched in 2021 by\nholding workshops with 12 panelists representing 10 countries in Madrid in May 2023 and Dublin in April 2024. These\nevents help Ryanair to stay in touch with what our customers need and want, particularly as the Group continues its self-\nservice journey, and help Ryanair to evaluate the new technology it plans to launch and informs management on\nimprovements they need to make to the website, mobile applications and customer communications. Ryanair will also\n25\ndeliver a new customer portal in the customer’s Ryanair account, allowing customers to interact with Ryanair through a\nsecure service portal, providing timely responses to common questions and updates on refunds, claims and queries.\nRyanair is proud of how we support our passengers with reduced mobility and hidden disabilities, with\napproximately 3m passengers travelling with the Group in fiscal year 2024 needing some level of additional assistance.\nRyanair officially recognises the Hidden Disabilities sunflower symbol across our network and our crews are trained on\nhow to assist passengers wearing the sunflower symbol. For those passengers that have difficulty accessing our\nwebsite, we operate voice recognition software in partnership with ‘Amazon Alexa’ allowing customers who are sight\nimpaired or who cannot use a keyboard or phone pad to access the Ryanair Help Centre by simply asking Alexa. Alexa\nrelays to customers and web/app users relevant information contained in our Help Centre. In fiscal year 2024, we\nlaunched the SignVideo service which provides specific assistance for sign language users. We are active participants\nwith aviation authorities on accessibility frameworks and the development of industry leading practices on improving\naccessibility to customers.\nFrequent point-to-point flights on short-haul routes. Ryanair provides frequent point-to-point service on short-haul\nroutes. In fiscal year 2024, Ryanair flew an average route length of approximately 780 miles and an average flight\nduration of approximately 2.2 hours. Short-haul routes allow Ryanair to offer its low fares and frequent service, while\neliminating the need to provide unnecessary “frills”, like free in-flight meals and movies, otherwise expected by\ncustomers on longer flights. Point-to-point flying (as opposed to hub-and-spoke service) allows Ryanair to offer direct,\nnon-stop, routes and avoid the costs of providing “through service” for connecting passengers, including baggage\ntransfer and transit passenger assistance.\nLow Operating Costs. Management believes that the Ryanair Group’s operating costs are among the lowest of\nany European scheduled-passenger airline group. Ryanair strives to reduce or control four of the primary expenses\ninvolved in running a major scheduled airline group: (i) aircraft equipment and finance costs; (ii) personnel costs; (iii)\ncustomer service costs; and (iv) airport access and handling costs:\n(i) Aircraft Equipment and Finance Costs. Ryanair currently operates mainly Boeing 737s. The operation of\nprimarily a single aircraft type enables Ryanair to limit the costs associated with personnel training,\nmaintenance, and the purchase and storage of spare parts while also affording the Company greater flexibility\nin the scheduling of crews and equipment. Management also believes that the terms of Ryanair’s contracts with\nBoeing are favorable to Ryanair. The strength of Ryanair’s balance sheet and cash flows also enables the Group\nto lease aircraft at competitive rates (such as the 27 A320s leased by Lauda). See “—Aircraft” below for\nadditional information on Ryanair’s fleet. The Company has a BBB+ (stable outlook) credit rating from both S&P\nand Fitch Ratings (see “Item 3. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Company—The Company\nwill incur significant costs acquiring new aircraft and any instability in the credit and capital markets could\nnegatively impact Ryanair’s ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms” above) and can raise inexpensive\nunsecured debt in the capital markets. The Company also finances aircraft from its strong cash flows.\n(ii) Personnel Costs. Ryanair endeavors to control its labor costs through incentivizing high productivity.\nCompensation for personnel emphasizes productivity-based pay incentives. These incentives include sales\nbonus payments for onboard sales of products for cabin crew and payments based on the number of hours or\nsectors flown by pilots and cabin crew within strict limits set by regulations fixing maximum working hours.\n(iii) Customer Service Costs. Ryanair has entered into agreements with external contractors at certain airports\nfor ticketing, passenger and aircraft handling, and other services (including the use of self-service kiosks) that\nmanagement believes can be more cost-efficiently provided by third parties. Ryanair negotiates competitive\nrates for such services by negotiating fixed-price, multi-year contracts. The development of its own internet\nbooking facility has allowed Ryanair to eliminate travel agent commissions. As part of its strategic initiatives,\n26\nand the Always Getting Better (“AGB”) customer experience program launched in 2013, the Company has\nbroadened its distribution base by making Ryanair’s fares available to bricks & mortar travel agents and\ncorporate travel booking tools via GDSs Travelport (trading as Galileo and Worldspan), Amadeus and Sabre, as\nwell as Concur and Kyte. Direct sales via the Ryanair website and mobile app (including through referrals from\nauthorised OTAs under ‘direct distribution agreements’ – see: The Company faces risks related to unauthorized\nuse of information from the Company’s website) continues to be the main generator of scheduled passenger\nrevenues.\n(iv) Airport Access and Handling Costs. Ryanair prioritizes airports that offer competitive prices. The Ryanair\nGroup’s record of delivering a consistently high volume of passenger traffic growth at many airports has allowed\nit to negotiate favorable growth contracts with such airports. Since the launch of AGB (2013), the Company has\naccessed more primary airports, which typically have higher airport charges and greater competition along with\nslot limitations. Secondary and regional airports generally do not have slot requirements or other operating\nrestrictions that can increase operating expenses and limit the number of allowed take-offs and landings.\nRyanair endeavors to reduce its airport charges by opting, when practicable, for less expensive gate locations\nas well as outdoor boarding stairs, rather than jetways, which are more expensive and operationally less efficient\nto use. Ryanair requires all passengers to check-in on the Internet, which reduces waiting times at airports and\nspeeds a passenger’s journey from arrival at the airport to boarding, as well as significantly reducing airport\nhandling costs. Ryanair also charges a checked-bag fee, which is payable on the Internet at the time of booking\nor post booking and is aimed at reducing the number of bags carried by passengers in order to further reduce\nhandling and CO2 costs. See “Item 3. Key information—Risks related to the Company—The Company faces risks\nrelated to its internet reservations operations and its elimination of airport check-in facilities.”\nTaking advantage of digital platforms. Ryanair’s reservation system operates under a hosting agreement with\nNavitaire which currently extends to November 2027. As part of the implementation of the reservation system, Navitaire\ndeveloped an Internet booking facility. The Ryanair system allows Internet users to access its host reservation system\nand to make and pay for confirmed reservations in real time through the Ryanair.com website. The Company also has a\nmobile app which makes it simpler and easier for customers to book Ryanair flights. The website and app also offer\ncustomers the ability to add additional discretionary products on day of travel (e.g. checked bags, priority boarding,\npreferred seating and fast track). Ryanair has continued to invest in its website with the key features being\npersonalization, a “My-Ryanair” account, easier booking flow and more content. These features make Ryanair’s website\nfaster, intuitive and fully responsive for mobile devices. The “MyRyanair” registration service, which allows customers\nto securely store their personal and payment details, has also significantly quickened the booking process and made it\neasier for customers to book a flight. Membership of “My-Ryanair” is automatic for all bookings. Ryanair will endeavor\nto continue to improve its website and mobile app through a series of ongoing upgrades.\nCommitment to safety. Safety is the primary priority of Ryanair. This commitment includes the hiring and training\nof Ryanair’s pilots, cabin crew, and maintenance personnel and maintenance of its aircraft in accordance with Regulatory\nRequirements and the highest European industry standards. Ryanair has not had a single passenger or flight crew fatality\nas a result of an accident with one of its aircraft in its 39-year operating history. Although Ryanair seeks to maintain its\nfleet in a cost-effective manner, management does not seek to extend Ryanair’s low-cost operating strategy to the areas\nof safety, maintenance, training or quality assurance. Routine aircraft maintenance and repair services are performed\nprimarily by Ryanair, at Ryanair’s main bases, but are also performed at other base airports by maintenance contractors\napproved under the terms of an EASA Part 145 and UK CAA approval. Ryanair currently performs the majority of heavy\nairframe maintenance in-house, but contracts with other parties who perform engine overhaul services and rotable\nrepairs. Ryanair also outsources some heavy maintenance activity. These contractors also provide similar services to a\nnumber of other major European airlines.\n27\nEnhancement of operating results through ancillary services. Ryanair distributes travel insurance, fast track\nservices, parking and airport transfers, and accommodation services through its website and mobile app. Ryanair also\noffers car hire services via a contract with RentalCars. Ancillary revenues accounted for over 30% of Ryanair’s total\noperating revenues in both fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2023. See “—Ancillary Services” below and “Item 5. Operating\nand Financial Review and Prospects—Results of Operations—Fiscal Year 2022 Compared with Fiscal Year 2023—\nAncillary Revenues” for additional information.\nFocused criteria for growth. Ryanair believes it will have opportunities for continued growth by: (i) using fare\npromotions to stimulate demand; (ii) initiating additional routes in the EU; (iii) initiating additional routes in countries\nparty to a European Common Aviation Agreement with the EU that are currently served by higher-cost, higher-fare\ncarriers or where competitor traffic capacity has not yet fully returned following the Covid-19 pandemic; (iv) increasing\nthe frequency of service on its existing routes; (v) starting new domestic routes within individual EU countries and the\nUK; (vi) considering acquisition opportunities that may become available in the future; (vii) connecting airports within its\nexisting route network; (viii) establishing new bases; and (ix) initiating new routes not currently served by any carrier.\nResponding to market challenges. In recent periods, Ryanair’s low-fares business model faced substantial\npressure due to significantly increased fuel costs and economic contraction in the economies in which it operates\n(including global market disruptions related to the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak, the war in Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas\nconflict). The Company has aimed to meet these challenges by: (i) grounding aircraft during the winter season; (ii)\ncontrolling costs and liquidity; (iii) renegotiating contracts with existing suppliers, airports and handling companies and\n(iv) flexibly reallocating capacity to new markets. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in\nachieving all of the foregoing or taking other similar measures, or that doing so will allow the Company to earn profits in\nany period. See “Item 3. Key information—Risk factors—Risks related to the Company—Changes in fuel costs and\navailability affect the Company’s results” and “— The Company may not be successful in increasing fares to cover rising\nbusiness costs.” In prior years, in response to an operating environment characterized by high fuel prices, typically lower\nseasonal yields and higher airport charges and/or taxes, Ryanair adopted a policy of grounding a certain portion of its\nfleet during the winter months. Ryanair also carries out its scheduled aircraft maintenance at this quieter time of the\nyear. While seasonal grounding does reduce the Company’s operating costs, it also decreases Ryanair’s winter season\nflight and non-flight revenues. Decreasing the number and frequency of flights may also negatively affect the Company’s\nlabor relations, including its ability to attract flight personnel interested in full-time employment. See “Item 3. Key\ninformation—Risk factors—Risks related to the Company—Ryanair has seasonally grounded aircraft.”\n28\nROUTE SYSTEM, SCHEDULING AND FARES\nRoute System and Scheduling\nAs of June 26, 2024, the Company offered over 3,500 daily scheduled short-haul flights serving approximately\n235 airports largely throughout Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. The following table lists Ryanair’s 95 operating\nbases:\nOperating Bases\nAgadir Fez Paris (Beauvais)\nAlicante Frankfurt (Hahn) Pescara\nAthens Gdansk Pisa\nBaden-Baden Girona Porto\nBarcelona (El Prat) Gothenburg Poznan\nBari Ibiza Prague\nBelfast International Katowice Prestwick\nBerlin (Brandenburg) Kaunas Reggio\nBillund Krakow Riga\nBirmingham Lamezia Rome (Ciampino)\nBologna Lanzarote Rome (Fiumicino)\nBordeaux Leeds Bradford Santiago\nBournemouth Lisbon Seville\nBratislava Liverpool Shannon\nBrindisi London (Luton) Sofia\nBristol London (Stansted) Stockholm (Arlanda)\nBrussels (Charleroi) Madeira Tangier\nBucharest Madrid Tenerife South\nBudapest Malaga Thessaloniki\nCagliari Malta Toulouse\nCatania Manchester Trieste\nChania Marrakesh Turin\nCologne Marseille Valencia\nCopenhagen Memmingen Venice (Marco Polo)\nCorfu Milan (Bergamo) Venice (Treviso)\nCork Milan (Malpensa) Vienna\nDublin Naples Vilnius\nDubrovnik Newcastle Warsaw (Modlin)\nDusseldorf (Weeze) Nuremberg Wroclaw\nEast Midlands Palermo Zadar\nEdinburgh Palma de Mallorca Zagreb\nFaro Paphos\n29\nSee Note 16, “Analysis of operating revenues and segmental analysis” to the consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Item 18 for more information regarding the geographical sources of the Company’s revenue.\nRyanair’s objective is to schedule a sufficient number of flights per day on each of Ryanair’s routes to satisfy\ndemand for Ryanair’s low-fares service. Ryanair schedules departures on its most popular routes at frequent intervals\nnormally between approximately 6:00 a.m. and 12:00 a.m. Management regularly reviews the need for adjustments in\nthe number of flights on all of its routes.\nAs part of Ryanair’s AGB customer experience program Ryanair has focused on high frequency and business\nfriendly timings between Europe’s main business centers.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, the Ryanair Group opened 4 new bases and approximately 265 new routes across its\nnetwork. See “Item 3. Key information—Risk factors—Risks related to the Company—Ryanair’s new routes and expanded\noperations may have an adverse financial impact on its results.”\nWidely Available Low Fares\nRyanair offers low fares, with prices generally varying on the basis of advance booking, seat availability and\ndemand. Ryanair sells seats on a one-way basis, thus removing minimum stay requirements from all travel on Ryanair\nscheduled services. All tickets can be changed, subject to certain conditions, including fee payment and applicable\nupgrade charges. However, tickets are generally non-cancellable and non-refundable and must be paid for at the time of\nreservation.\nRyanair’s discounted fares are driven by Ryanair’s “load factor active – yield passive” strategy whereby seats\nare priced to ensure that high load factor targets are achieved.\nRyanair also periodically runs special promotional fare campaigns, in particular in connection with the opening\nof new routes, and endeavors to always offer the lowest fare on any route it serves. Promotional fares may have the\neffect of increasing load factors and reducing Ryanair’s yield and passenger revenues on the relevant routes during the\nperiods they are in effect. Ryanair expects to continue to offer significant fare promotions to stimulate demand in periods\nof lower activity or during off-peak times for the foreseeable future.\nMARKETING AND ADVERTISING\nRyanair’s primary marketing strategy is to emphasize its widely available low fares, route choice and great care.\nIn doing so, Ryanair primarily advertises its services in national and regional media across Europe. In addition, Ryanair\nuses online advertising, email marketing and social media to drive awareness of Ryanair’s flights and ancillary services.\nSocial media gives Ryanair access to reach a weekly audience of over 50m people.\nOther marketing activities include co-operative advertising campaigns with other travel-related entities,\nincluding local tourist boards. Ryanair also regularly contacts people who have registered in its database to inform them\nabout promotions and special offers.\nRESERVATIONS ON RYANAIR.COM\nPassenger airlines generally rely on travel agents (whether traditional or online) for a significant portion of their\nticket sales and pay travel agents’ commission for their services, as well as reimbursing them for the fees charged by\nreservation systems providers. In contrast, Ryanair encourages all passengers to make reservations and purchase\ntickets directly. Due to Ryanair’s long standing online distribution policy, the majority of reservations and purchases are\n30\nmade through the website Ryanair.com, although a significant number of customers are also booking on the Ryanair\napp and therefore, we are not reliant on travel agents. Ryanair has long campaigned against the anti-consumer practices\nof Online Travel Agents (OTAs) who overcharge customers, apply hidden mark-ups, and provide fake customer contact\nand payment details. In 2024, several OTAs have signed ‘direct distribution agreements’ with Ryanair that allow them to\nmarket Ryanair flights to consumers in compliance with the principles of price transparency, ensuring that Ryanair is\nprovided with genuine customer details. These deals protect customers from anti-consumer practices of\nscreenscraping OTAs. Customers who book through unauthorized OTAs are asked to verify their identity on our website\nto ensure all safety and security protocols during online check-in are adhered to.\nRyanair’s reservations system is hosted under an agreement with the system provider, Navitaire. Under the\nagreement, the system serves as Ryanair’s core seating inventory and booking system. In return for access to these\nsystem functions, Ryanair pays transaction fees that are generally based on the number of passenger seat journeys\nbooked through the system. Navitaire also retains back-up booking engines to support operations in the event of a\nbreakdown in the main system.\nThe Company has agreements with the GDSs Amadeus, Travelport (which operates the Galileo and Worldspan\nGDSs) and Sabre. These GDSs provide access to Ryanair fares (except for some promotional fare categories) to\ntraditional bricks & mortar travel agents and corporate travel booking tools, but do not offer our fares for re-sale online.\nIn 2024 Ryanair extended its distribution to corporate travelers by announcing agreements with Concur and Kyte.\nAIRCRAFT\nBoeing Aircraft\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company had a fleet of 557 Boeing 737 aircraft which are currently operated by Buzz,\nMalta Air, Ryanair DAC and Ryanair UK. The fleet includes 146 Boeing 737-8200 aircraft, each having 197 seats, 410\nBoeing 737-800 “next generation” (“NG”) aircraft, each having 189 seats and 1 Boeing 737-700.\nBetween March 1999 and March 2024, Ryanair took delivery of 532 Boeing 737NG aircraft, 1 Boeing 737-700\naircraft and 146 new Boeing 737-8200s under its contracts with Boeing and disposed of 122 Boeing 737NG aircraft,\nincluding 77 lease hand-backs. In fiscal year 2024, Ryanair took delivery of 48 new Boeing 737-8200 aircraft.\nUnder the terms of the 2014 Boeing Contract, which was repriced in December 2020, Ryanair agreed to purchase\n210 new Boeing 737-8200 “Gamechanger” aircraft delivering between fiscal years 2022 and 2025 inclusive. Deliveries\ncommenced in June 2021. The aircraft will be used on new and existing routes to grow the Ryanair Group’s business.\nThe Boeing 737-8200 represents the newest generation of Boeing’s 737 aircraft. It is a short-to-medium range aircraft\nand seats 197 passengers (eight (4%) more seats than Ryanair’s Boeing 737-800NG 189 seat fleet). The basic price\n(equivalent to a standard list price for an aircraft of this type) for each of the Boeing 737-8200 series aircraft under the\n2014 Boeing Contract is approximately U.S.$102.5m. Net of basic credits and reflective of price escalation over the\noriginal scheduled delivery timeframe, the value of the 210 Boeing 737-8200 aircraft under the 2014 Boeing Contract is\napproximately U.S.$9.6bn. Boeing has granted Ryanair certain price concessions as part of the 2014 Boeing Contract.\nAs a result, the \"effective price\" (the purchase price of the new aircraft net of discounts received from Boeing) of each\nnew aircraft will be significantly below the basic price mentioned above. The effective price applies to all new aircraft\ndelivering from fiscal year 2022 through to fiscal year 2025.\nUnder the terms of the 2023 Boeing Contract, Ryanair agreed to purchase up to 300 Boeing 737-MAX-10 series\naircraft (of which 150 are firm orders and 150 are subject to an option exercisable at Ryanair’s discretion) in the period\nfrom calendar 2027 to 2033 inclusive. It is a short-to-medium range aircraft and, for Ryanair’s specified configuration,\nwill seat 228 passengers (39 (21%) more than the Group’s existing Boeing 737-800NGs). The Boeing 737-MAX-10 also\n31\noffers significantly improved fuel, carbon and noise efficiencies compared to the Boeing 737-800NG, with approximately\n20% lower fuel and CO2 emissions and up to 50% less noise. The Basic Price (equivalent to a standard list price for an\naircraft of this type) for each of the Boeing 737-MAX-10 series aircraft is approximately US$135m. Net of basic credits,\nthe value of the 150 firm Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft under the 2023 Boeing Contract is approximately U.S.$10.6bn.\nBoeing has granted Ryanair certain price concessions as part of the 2023 Boeing Contract. As a result, the \"effective\nprice\" (the purchase price of the New Aircraft net of discounts received from Boeing) of each Boeing 737-MAX-10 will\nbe significantly below the Basic Price mentioned above. The effective price applies to all Boeing 737-MAX-10s due for\ndelivery from early calendar 2027.\nFor additional details on the Boeing contracts, scheduled aircraft deliveries and related expenditures and their\nfinancing, see “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\nThe Boeing 737 is the world’s most widely used commercial aircraft and exists in a number of generations, the\nBoeing 737-8200 being the most recent entering service.\nThe Boeing 737NGs are fitted with CFM 56-7B engines and have advanced CAT III Autoland capability, advanced\ntraffic collision avoidance systems, and enhanced ground-proximity warning systems. The Boeing 737-8200s are fitted\nwith CFM LEAP-1B engines which, combined with the Advanced Technology winglet and other aerodynamic\nimprovements, should reduce fuel consumption by up to approximately 16% on a per seat basis compared to the Boeing\n737NGs in Ryanair’s configuration and reduce operational noise emissions by up to 50%.\nFor additional information, please see “Item 3—Key information—Risk factors—Risks related to the Company—\nA majority of Ryanair’s aircraft and certain parts are sourced from a single supplier; therefore, Ryanair would be\nmaterially and adversely affected if such supplier was unable to provide additional equipment or support”.\nAt March 31, 2024, the average aircraft age of the Company’s Boeing 737 fleet was approximately 9 years.\nAirbus Aircraft\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company had a fleet of 27 leased Airbus A320 aircraft (2023: 28; 2022: 29). These\naircraft are operated by Lauda, as a wet lease operator for the Group, and have 180 seats. They are powered by a mix of\nCFM 56-5B and Pratt & Whitney V2500 engines. At March 31, 2024, the average aircraft age of the Company’s leased\nAirbus A320 fleet was approximately 17 years.\nSummary\nRyanair expects to have approximately 800 narrow-body aircraft in its fleet following delivery of all the Boeing\n737-8200 and Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft, assuming up to 150 disposals of older aircraft (including lease returns) over\nthe period and Boeing’s ability to fulfil both the 2014 and 2023 Boeing Contract.\nTraining and Regulatory Compliance\nAt March 31, 2024 Ryanair owns and operates 10 Boeing 737-800NG, 8 Boeing 737-8200 and 1 A320 full flight\nsimulators for pilot training. The simulators were purchased from CAE Inc of Quebec, Canada (“CAE”). In addition,\nRyanair currently owns and operates 9 state of the art, fixed base simulators from Multi Pilot Simulations (“MPS”) which\nare used for pilot assessments and pilot training. In autumn 2021, Ryanair, in partnership with Aviation Flight Academy\n(“AFA”), opened a new, state of the art, training centre in Dublin which includes both Boeing 737-8200 and A320 full flight\nsimulators, and a full Boeing 737 Cabin Trainer. At the end of 2021, Ryanair agreed to purchase an additional 8 (6\nconfirmed and 2 options) full flight simulators from CAE, and 1 fixed based simulator from MPS. In fiscal year 2023,\nRyanair took delivery of 3 Boeing 737-8200 full flight simulators and a new fixed based simulator. In summer 2023\n32\nRyanair expanded the East Midlands Training Centre by acquiring a second facility allowing for additional capacity\nacross both facilities. In fiscal year 2024, Ryanair took delivery of 2 Boeing 737-8200 full flight simulators, 1 into the\nBergamo Training Centre, and 1 into the East Midlands Training Centre. In fiscal year 2025, Ryanair will take delivery of\n1 Boeing 737-8200 full flight simulator, which will replace a Boeing 737-800NG full flight simulator (manufactured 2004)\nin East Midlands Training Centre. In Summer 2023, Ryanair agreed to exercise the remaining 2 options in the 2021\npurchase agreement and purchase an additional 12 (6 firm orders and 6 options) full flight simulators from CAE. The\nGroup recently commenced construction of two further, state-of-the-art, training centres in Krakow and Madrid.\nManagement believes that Ryanair is currently in compliance with all applicable regulations and EU directives\nconcerning its fleet of Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft and will comply with any regulations or applicable EU and\nUK directives that may come into effect in the future. However, there can be no assurance that the FAA, the UK CAA,\nEASA or any other regulatory authorities will not recommend or require other safety-related undertakings that could\nadversely impact the Company’s results of operations or financial condition, in particular safety-related undertakings\nrelated to the Boeing 737-8200. See “Item 3. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Airline Industry—Safety-\nrelated undertakings could affect the Company’s results.”\nANCILLARY SERVICES\nRyanair provides various ancillary services and engages in other activities connected with its core air passenger\nservice, including non-flight scheduled services (e.g. Priority Boarding and Reserved Seating), internet-related services\n(e.g. SMS flight confirmation and Dynamic Currency Conversion), and the in-flight sale of beverages, food, duty-free and\nmerchandise.\nRyanair primarily markets car hire, travel insurance and accommodation services through its website and mobile\napp. Ryanair offers car hire services via a contract with RentalCars. Ryanair receives a commission on these sales.\nRyanair markets car parking, fast-track, airport transfers, attractions and activities on its website and mobile\napp. Ryanair also sells gift vouchers which are redeemable online.\nMAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS\nGeneral\nAs part of its commitment to safety, Ryanair endeavors to hire qualified maintenance personnel, provide proper\ntraining to such personnel, and maintain its aircraft in accordance with EASA and UK Regulations and European industry\nstandards. While Ryanair seeks to maintain its fleet in a cost-effective manner, management does not seek to extend\nRyanair’s low-cost operating strategy to the areas of continuing airworthiness management, maintenance, training, or\nquality assurance.\nEASA came into being on September 28, 2003 through the adoption of Regulation (EC) No. 1592/2002 of the\nEuropean Parliament, and its standards superseded the previous Joint Aviation Authority (“JAA”) requirements. See “—\nGovernment Regulation—Regulatory Authorities” below.\nPost Brexit, with the UK leaving EASA, aircraft registered in the UK are managed in accordance with the UK\nequivalent regulations.\nRyanair Engineering and the Safety & Compliance department manage the Continuing Airworthiness of the\nGroup fleet in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) No. 1321/2014 of 26 November 2014 - Continuing\nAirworthiness and UK Reg. (EU) 1321/2014 - the UK Continuing Airworthiness regulation. Each Group Airline holds\napplicable approval with their respective National Airworthiness Authority (IAA Ireland, TMCAD Malta, Polish CAA and\nUK CAA), providing robust oversight of all maintenance activities.\n33\nMaintenance activities are undertaken in accordance with EASA and UK Part 145 as applicable, by Ryanair DAC\nunder IAA approval and approved contracted providers.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, Ryanair established the Ryanair Engineering Academy (the “Academy”) to increase the\nnumber of trainees recruited into the Group to align headcount with future aircraft deliveries. The calendar year 2023\nengineering intake included 365 trainees, however the development of the Academy will see this grow to 700 in calendar\nyear 2024 and over 1,000 in calendar year 2025. The Academy is approved to deliver maintenance type training courses\nunder EASA and UK Part-147 approvals, with 4 approved training sites located across the Ryanair network, in London\n(Stansted), Glasgow (Prestwick), Seville and Shannon.\nRyanair is an EASA Part-145 approved maintenance organization and provides its own routine aircraft\nmaintenance and repair services. Ryanair also performs certain line maintenance checks on its aircraft, including pre-\nflight and daily checks at a number of its bases, as well as A-checks at its London Stansted (5 bays), Bergamo (5 bays),\nDublin (2 bays), Vienna (2 bays), Nuremberg (2 bays), Madrid (1 bay), Malta (1 bay) and Porto (1 bay) facilities to support\nline maintenance on Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft.\nRyanair performs the majority of its Boeing 737 heavy airframe maintenance utilizing a Ryanair associated Part-\n145 approval/organization for heavy maintenance with a seasonal use of third-party maintenance repair and overhaul\n(the “MRO”) facilities. Ryanair has hangar facilities in Prestwick (6 bays), Seville (5 bays), Kaunas (4 bays), Wroclaw (4\nbays), Shannon (3 bays) and Hahn (2 bays) which are used for C-check maintenance activities.\nRyanair will continue to look for opportunities to invest in additional hangar facilities over the coming years to\nensure there is sufficient hangar capacity for the growing fleet. Ryanair plans to add a further 9 bays in Madrid, 3 bays\nin Wroclaw, 2 bays in Kaunas, 2 bays in Porto and 2 bays in Dublin and currently has plans to open a new 4 bay hangar\nin Marrakesh, a new 3 bay hanger in Berlin and a new 2 bay hangar in Palma.\nMaintenance and repair services that may become necessary while an aircraft is located at other airports served\nby Ryanair are provided by other EASA Part 145-approved contract maintenance providers. Aircraft return each evening\nto Ryanair’s bases, where they are examined by either Ryanair’s approved personnel or by local EASA Part 145-approved\ncompanies.\nHeavy Maintenance\nRyanair expects to be dependent on external service contractors for Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 maintenance,\nparticularly for airframe, engine and component maintenance, for the foreseeable future, notwithstanding the\ncapabilities provided by its current maintenance facilities. See “Item 3. Key Information — Risk Factors — Risks Related\nto the Company — The Group is dependent on external service providers”. Ryanair utilises MRO’s which provide a high\nstandard of maintenance. The Group has recently extended its maintenance agreement with the MRO provider Joramco\n(in Jordan) which will see them undertake 10 lines of heavy maintenance for the Group until 2034.\nRyanair contracts out engine overhaul service for its Boeing 737-800NG aircraft to CFM under a ten-year\nagreement to December 2027, with an option for extension. This comprehensive maintenance contract provides for the\nrepair and overhaul of the CFM56-7B series engines fitted to Ryanair’s Boeing 737-800NG aircraft, the repair of parts\nand general technical support for the fleet of engines. CFM uses its EASA Part-145 approved repair facilities in Cardiff\n(Wales), Celma (Brazil), Paris (France), Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), Queretaro (Mexico) and Safran Aero (Morocco). By\ncontracting with experienced EASA Part-145 approved maintenance providers, management believes it is better able to\nensure the quality of its engine maintenance. CFM LEAP-1B Engines installed on the Boeing 737-8200 aircraft are subject\nto warranty by CFM. Any required repairs/overhauls subject to this warranty will be accomplished by CFM at its EASA\nPart-145 approved repair facilities. Engine maintenance providers are also monitored closely by the national authorities\n34\nunder EASA and national regulations. Ryanair trained engineering staff with both Boeing and CFM in advance of the\nintroduction of the Boeing 737-8200 aircraft to the Ryanair fleet.\nSAFETY RECORD\nRyanair has not had a single passenger or flight crew fatality in its 39-year operating history. Ryanair\ndemonstrates its commitment to safe operations through its safety policy, training, procedures, its investment in safety-\nrelated equipment and enhancements, and its adoption of an internal, open, and confidential reporting system for safety\nand security matters. The Company’s Board of Directors also has a Safety and Security Committee to review and discuss\nair safety and security performance. Members of the Committee include Non-Executive Directors, Mike O’Brien, Eamonn\nBrennan (from July 2023) and Ryanair’s Chief Risk Officer, Carol Sharkey. The Accountable Managers of each of the\nRyanair Group Airlines and nominated persons are invited to attend. Mr. O’Brien and Ms. Sharkey reports to the Board\nof Directors each quarter.\nRyanair’s flight crew training is oriented towards accident prevention and integrates with the Safety\nManagement System to cover all aspects of flight operations. Threat and Error Management (“TEM”) is at the core of\nall flight crew training programs. Ryanair maintains full control of the content and delivery of all flight crew training,\nincluding initial, recurrent, and upgrade phases. All training programs are approved/accepted by the relevant National\nCompetent Aviation Authority, (including the IAA, TMCAD Malta, the Polish CAA and the UK CAA) which regularly audits\noperations standards and flight crew training standards for compliance with EU and UK legislation. All Boeing 737s that\nRyanair has bought are certified for Category IIIA landings (automatic landings with minimum horizontal visibility of 200\nmeters and a 50 feet decision height).\nRyanair has a comprehensive and documented Safety Management System. Management actively encourages\nflight crews to report any safety-related issues through the Safety Reporting system, which is available online. Also\navailable to crew is Ryanair’s Confidential Reporting System (“RCRS”) which affords personnel the opportunity to report\ndirectly to Safety Officers any event, error, or discrepancy in operations that does not fall into the category of a mandatory\nreport required by regulation, and they do not wish to report through standard reporting channels. Management uses the\nde-identified information reported through all reporting channels to modify training and/or procedures and improve flight\noperations standards as necessary. Additionally, Ryanair promotes the use of CHIRP, a confidential reporting system\nthat is endorsed by the UK CAA as an alternative confidential reporting channel.\nRyanair has installed an automatic data capturing system on each of its Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft.\nThis system captures and downloads aircraft performance information for use as part of Operational Flight Data\nMonitoring (“OFDM”) which automatically provides a confidential report on exceedances from normal operating\nlimitations detected during the course of each flight. The purpose of this system is to monitor operational performance\nand trends and identify any instance of an operational limit being exceeded. By analyzing this information, management\ncan identify undesirable trends and potential areas of operational risk, so as to take steps to rectify such deviations,\nthereby ensuring adherence to Ryanair’s flight safety standards.\nAIRPORT OPERATIONS\nAirport Handling Services\nRyanair provides its own ground services, aircraft handling and passenger services either directly or through\nself-handling partners at Dublin, London (Stansted), Spain, Portugal and various Polish airports. All other airport handling\nis provided through the airport authorities, either directly through sub-contractors or the airport themselves. Our Ground\nOperations teams work to obtain the most competitive handling rates for ground, aircraft, and passenger services across\nour network by negotiating multiyear deals with growth or efficiency incentives where possible with fixed or capped\nrates to lock in long term costs. These contracts are generally scheduled to expire in one to seven years, unless renewed\n35\nand part of the rates are performance related to ensure compliance and punctuality. Self-handling gives Ryanair the\noption under European regulations to handle its own aircraft and passenger services where we cannot obtain\ncompetitive rates or quality handling services at each airport. See “Item 3. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks Related\nto the Company—The Group is dependent on external service providers.”\nAirport Charges\nAs with other airlines, Ryanair must pay airport charges each time it lands and accesses facilities at the airports\nit serves. Depending on the policy of the individual airport, such charges can include landing fees, passenger loading\nfees, security fees and parking fees. Ryanair attempts to negotiate discounted fees by delivering annual increases in\npassenger traffic and/or access to new destinations, and opts, when practicable, for less expensive facilities, such as\nless convenient gates and the use of outdoor boarding stairs rather than more expensive jetways. Nevertheless, there\ncan be no assurance that the airports Ryanair uses will not impose higher airport charges in the future and that any such\nincreases would not adversely affect the Company’s operations.\nSee “Item 3. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Company—Ryanair’s continued growth is\ndependent on access to suitable airports; charges for airport access are subject to increase.” See also “Item 8. Financial\nInformation—Other Financial Information—Legal Proceedings—EU State Aid-Related Proceedings” for information\nregarding legal proceedings in which Ryanair’s economic arrangements with several publicly owned airports are being\ncontested.\nFUEL\nThe cost of jet fuel (including carbon and de-icing costs) accounted for approximately 45% and 43% of Ryanair’s\ntotal operating expenses in the fiscal years ended 2024 and 2023 respectively. In each case, this accounts for costs\nafter giving effect to the Company’s hedging activities. The future availability and cost of jet fuel cannot be predicted\nwith any degree of certainty, and Ryanair’s low-fares policy limits its ability to pass on increased fuel costs to passengers\nthrough increased fares. Jet fuel prices are dependent on crude oil prices, which are quoted in U.S. dollars. If the value\nof the U.S. dollar strengthens against the euro, Ryanair’s fuel costs, expressed in euro, may increase even in absence of\nany increase in the U.S. dollar price of jet fuel. Ryanair has also entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge\nagainst some currency fluctuations. See “Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk— Foreign\nCurrency Exposure and Hedging.”\nRyanair typically enters into arrangements providing for significant protection against fluctuations in fuel prices,\nthrough both forward swap contracts and call options covering periods of up to 12 to 18 months of anticipated jet fuel\nrequirements. If capacity is significantly reduced, as was the case in fiscal year 2021 due to European Governments\nresponse to the spread of Covid-19, forward contracts may become ineffective for hedge accounting purposes. See\n“Item 3. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Company—Changes in fuel costs and availability affect the\nCompany’s results” and “Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Fuel Price Exposure and\nHedging” for additional information on recent trends in fuel costs and the Company’s related hedging activities, as well\nas certain associated risks. See also “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Fiscal Year 2024\nCompared with Fiscal Year 2023—Fuel and Oil.”\n36\nINSURANCE\nRyanair is exposed to potential catastrophic losses that may be incurred in the event of an aircraft accident or\nterrorist incident. Any such accident or incident could involve costs related to the repair or replacement of a damaged\naircraft and its consequent temporary or permanent loss from service. In addition, an accident or incident could result\nin significant legal claims against the Company from injured passengers and others who experienced injury or property\ndamage as a result of the accident or incident, including ground victims. Ryanair maintains aviation third-party liability\ninsurance, passenger liability insurance, employer liability insurance, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, aircraft\ninsurance for aircraft loss or damage, and other business insurance in amounts per occurrence consistent with industry\nstandards. Ryanair believes its insurance coverage is adequate, although not comprehensive. There can be no assurance\nthat the amount of such coverage will not need to be increased, that insurance premiums will not increase significantly\nor that Ryanair will not be forced to bear substantial losses from accidents. Ryanair’s insurance does not cover claims\nfor losses incurred when, due to unforeseen events, airspace is closed and aircraft are grounded such as the airspace\nclosures described in “Item 3. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Airline Industry—Extreme weather\nevents could affect the Company and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.”\nThe cost of insurance coverage for certain third-party liabilities arising from “acts of war” or terrorism increased\ndramatically as a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the war in Ukraine. Ryanair’s insurers have\nindicated that the scope of the Company’s current war-related insurance coverage may exclude certain types of\ncatastrophic incidents, which may result in the Company seeking alternative coverage.\nRyanair has established Aviation Insurance Limited (“AIL”), a wholly owned captive insurance company\nsubsidiary based in Malta, to provide the Company with self-insurance as part of its ongoing risk-management strategy.\nAIL underwrites a portion of the Company’s aviation insurance program, which covers not only the Company’s aircraft\nbut also its liability to passengers and to third parties. AIL reinsures virtually all of the aviation insurance risk it\nunderwrites with recognized third parties in the aviation reinsurance market, with the amount of AIL’s maximum\naggregate exposure not currently subject to such reinsurance agreements being equal to approximately U.S.$15m.\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No. 2027/97, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No. 889/2002, governs air carrier\nliability. This legislation provides for unlimited liability of an air carrier in the event of death or bodily injuries suffered by\npassengers, implementing the Warsaw Convention of 1929 for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to\nTransportation by Air, as amended by the Montreal Convention of 1999. Ryanair has extended its liability insurance to\nmeet the appropriate requirements of the legislation. See “Item 3. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks Related to the\nAirline Industry—The Company faces the risk of loss and liability” for information on the Company’s risks of loss and\nliability.\n37\nFACILITIES\nThe following are the principal facilities owned or leased by the Ryanair Group:\nSite Area Floor Space\nLocation (Sq.

The airport\noffice facilities used by Ryanair at London (Stansted) are leased from the airport authority; similar facilities at each of\nthe other airports Ryanair group airlines serve are provided by third party service providers.\nTRADEMARKS\nRyanair’s name, logo, certain other names and logos, as well as certain slogans, are registered as:\n(1) European Union Trademarks – registrations which afford uniform protection in all 27 EU member states.\n(2) National trademarks (in, for example, the UK, Jordan and Lebanon) – registrations which afford protection in the\nstate of registration.\n(3) International trademarks – registrations designating relevant countries, which in turn operate as national trademark\nregistrations.\nRegistered trademarks give Ryanair an exclusive monopoly over the use of the particular mark in the relevant\njurisdiction and the right to sue for trademark infringement should another party use an identical or similar mark in\nrelation to identical or similar services.\nTHE ENVIRONMENT\nRyanair’s Environmental Policy commits the Group to what the Board and management believe are ambitious\nfuture environmental targets, building on impressive achievements to date, including commitments to address climate\nchange, and the priorities and policies which will allow the Group to continue to lower CO2 emission intensity and noise\npollution.\nRyanair’s Environmental Strategy illustrates Ryanair’s commitment to managing its impact on the environment,\nwith key targets and achievements including:\n38\nTargets\n• Achieving net carbon zero by 2050, as set out in Ryanair’s 2024 Sustainability Report – ‘Aviation with Purpose’;\n• Reduce CO2 per passenger/kilometer to c.50 grams by 2031;\n• Power 12.5% of our flights with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2030; and\n• Retain, or improve, the Group’s strong CDP climate protection rating (currently “A-“).\nAchievements\n• Becoming the first Airline Group to publish its CO2 statistics monthly in fiscal year 2019;\n• Investing billions of euro in new fuel and noise efficient aircraft;\n• Commercial SAF partnerships with Enilive, Neste, OMV, Repsol and Shell;\n• Sustainalytics top rated European airline for ESG;\n• Industry leading MSCI ‘A’ rating and CDP ‘A-‘ rating;\n• Extended our Sustainable Aviation Research Centre partnership with Trinity College Dublin to 2030; and\n• Appointment of a Director of Sustainability in 2021, reporting at least quarterly to the Audit Committee and Board,\nto oversee delivery of ambitious environmental commitments.\nRyanair manages its impact on the environment and lowers CO2 emissions by operating a young fleet, achieving\nhigh load factors and efficient fuel burn. These enable Ryanair to minimize fuel and energy consumption and reduce\nnoise pollution.\nClimate Governance and Strategy\nRyanair’s Board has ultimate oversight and responsibility of the Group’s climate transition plan, strategy in\nachieving sustainability goals and climate-related risks and opportunities. The Board and Audit Committee receive\nquarterly updates on Ryanair’s climate related risks and performance from the Director of Sustainability & Finance and\nGroup CFO.\nClimate-related risks and opportunities are incorporated into the Ryanair Group's environmental policy. The\nBoard reviews the environmental policy annually and receives quarterly updates on performance. Environmental\nopportunities and threats are factored into our financial and operational planning, including operational fuel efficiencies\nand regulatory impacts.\nThese risks are identified through scenario analysis, horizon scanning and ongoing industry scrutiny. Key\ntransitional risks are assessed and managed across the organization primarily through the enterprise risk management\nregister with upstream climate risks also raised to the Sustainability Committee. These risks include Market and\nTechnology Shifts, Reputation, Policy, Legal and Physical Risks.\nRyanair’s long-term strategy identifies climate change as a key area that will impact the business in coming\nyears. Short and medium-term risks and opportunities are addressed on an ongoing basis by the Ryanair Sustainability\nCommittee and Sustainability team who, ultimately, report back to the Board.\nIn recent years, geopolitical events have disrupted existing supply and demand patterns of the energy market.\nDespite this disruption, movements towards a cleaner energy system have continued through advancements in\nEuropean Union policies, including the “Fit for 55 package” and “REPowerEU”. High fossil fuel prices, as seen since the\nwar in Ukraine began, present an opportunity to operate more efficiently and build momentum in energy transition to\nsustainable aviation fuels and fleet renewal through the Group’s 210 Boeing 737-8200 aircraft order and the Group’s\nnew 300 Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft (150 firm and 150 options) order under the 2023 Boeing Agreement.\n39\nIn fiscal year 2022, the Ryanair Group published its Pathway to Net Zero – a detailed plan on how the Group\naims to achieve its emissions reductions. This pathway forms a key pillar of our ongoing Group strategy. Emission\nreductions will come from:\n• 32% technological and operational improvements;\n• 34% Sustainable Aviation Fuel;\n• 10% Single European Sky initiative; and\n• 24% carbon offsetting.\nThe aviation industry conducted a feasibility study “Destination 2050” of reaching Net Zero emissions by 2050.\nThis study demonstrates that reaching net zero emissions in aviation is possible. Key challenges are recognized in\nreaching these long-term goals (as detailed further in the below “Material transition risk related to climate change and\nconsequences” section) most notably around the inability to obtain sufficient quantities of SAF.\nRyanair recognizes that transition risk costs will arise in connection with the climate change transition. The\nGroup has a history, as demonstrated through its recent aircraft orders, in maintaining a young, fuel efficient fleet and\nany breakthrough in new technology engines, will be procured as part of ongoing fleet renewal. Additionally, while\nsustainable aviation fuels currently trade at a premium of approximately 3x compared to normal jet kerosene, the long-\nterm outlook is for price convergence and there are a number of policymaker decisions which are currently being\nreviewed which will aim to reduce the existing price divergence (e.g. government incentives to procure SAF, Emission\nTrading System reform legislation, etc.).\nAny and all firm commitments regarding climate change transition are recognized within respective going\nconcern or impairment assessments. There are no material litigation risks related to climate change currently identified.\nMaterial transition risks related to climate change and consequences\n• Inability to meet mandated SAF blending – could lead to increased cost for SAF or potential non-compliance\npenalties resulting in lower earnings.\nRyanair has bi-lateral agreements in place with a number of SAF suppliers. These agreements allow Ryanair\naccess to SAF at key airport locations. These agreements are in place with Enilive, Neste, OMV, Repsol and\nShell. By using SAF, Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emissions will decrease which will reduce Emissions Trading\nSystem (“ETS”) and Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (“CORSIA”) compliance\ncosts.\n• Increased consumer concern about climate change could lead to a reluctance to fly.\nBy Ryanair positioning itself as a leader in the climate change agenda for aviation, there is an opportunity that\npassengers will switch to flying with Ryanair. There is an opportunity to enhance the Group reputation and brand\nvalue as a carbon efficient airline.\n• Costs to transition to lower emissions technology could result in higher capital expenditure and lower\nearnings\nRyanair has had a long-standing strategy for fleet modernization supported with strong cash flows and access\nto capital markets. Ryanair's current Boeing average fleet age is approximately 9 years.\nNew technologies will be more fuel efficient, delivering ongoing operational cost savings, an example of which\nis Ryanair’s decision to retrofit 409 Boeing 737-800NG aircraft with split scimitar winglets, which provide an\nemission reduction benefit of approximately 1.5% and lower noise by approximately 6%.\n40\nMaterial physical risks related to climate change and consequences\n• Increased severity of extreme weather events such as wild-fires, cyclones and floods could lead to\noperational disruption and potential revenue loss.\nGroup assets are highly mobile and can be moved and are therefore not subject to acute risks associated\nwith coastal flooding or tropical cyclones.\n• Chronic physical risks such as higher average temperatures or flooding could potentially lead to lower\nperformance due to cancelled flights or closed bases.\nWeather conditions are closely monitored, with the Group flying predominantly intra-European routes which\nwould be less affected by physical risks.\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nRegulatory Authorities\nEU air carriers such as the Company and the Group Airlines are generally able to provide passenger services on\ndomestic routes within any EU member state outside their home country, as well as between EU member states without\nrestriction, subject to applicable EU and national regulations implemented by competent authorities, including the\nEuropean Commission and EASA, as well as oversight by the European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation\n(“Eurocontrol”). The Group Airlines are also subject to national regulation in their home countries, which is implemented\nprimarily by (i) in Ireland, the Irish Aviation Authority (“IAA”) and the Department of Transport (“DoT”) in the case of\nRyanair DAC, (ii) in Poland, the Polish Civil Aviation Authority (“Polish CAA”) in the case of Buzz, (iii) in Malta, Transport\nMalta and the Civil Aviation Directorate (“Maltese CAD”) in the case of Lauda Europe and Malta Air, and (iv) in the United\nKingdom, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport (“UK DfT”) in the case of Ryanair UK.\nManagement believes that the present regulatory environment in the EU is generally characterized by high\nsensitivity to safety and security issues, which is demonstrated by intensive reviews of safety-related procedures,\ntraining and equipment by the national and EU regulatory authorities. During the Covid-19 crisis, various public health\nmeasures were imposed on airlines, including requirements in certain countries to verify passenger’s health\ndocumentation and, in certain cases, restrictions on the freedom to operate flights.\nIreland\nIrish Aviation Authority. The IAA is primarily responsible for regulating the safety, security and technical aspects\nof aviation in Ireland. The IAA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the authority to require reports\nand investigate and institute enforcement proceedings.\nTo operate in the EU, an Irish air carrier is required to hold an AOC granted by the IAA attesting to the air carrier’s\noperational and technical competence to conduct airline services with specified types of aircraft. The IAA has broad\nauthority to amend or revoke an AOC, with Ryanair’s ability to continue to hold its AOC being subject to ongoing\ncompliance with current and future applicable statutes, rules and regulations pertaining to the airline industry. Ryanair\nDAC’s current AOC (No. IE 07/94) was issued by the IAA on January 11, 2022.\nEach aircraft operated by Ryanair DAC is required to have a Certificate of Airworthiness issued by the IAA. The\nvalidity of each Certificate of Airworthiness, and the Company’s Flight Operations Department, flight personnel, flight\nand emergency procedures, aircraft, and maintenance facilities are each subject to periodic review and inspections by\nthe IAA.\n41\nUnder Ireland’s Air Navigation and Transport Act 2022, the air navigation service provision function of the IAA\nwas transferred into a new corporate entity, AirNav Ireland, in May 2023, while the safety and security regulation\nfunctions of the IAA were retained within the IAA. The Act further provided for the dissolution of the Commission for\nAviation Regulation (“CAR”) and the merger of its functions and responsibilities with the IAA, creating a single regulator\nfor the civil aviation sector in Ireland, covering safety, security, economic and consumer regulation.\nFollowing the dissolution of CAR and the merger of its functions with the IAA (which took place on April 30,\n2023), the IAA is responsible for issuing operating licenses to air carriers registered in Ireland under EU Regulation\n1008/2008. The criteria for granting an operating license include, inter alia, an air carrier’s financial fitness, the adequacy\nof its insurance and the fitness of its management. In addition, EU regulations require that (i) the air carrier must be\nowned, for the purposes of EU Regulation 1008/2008, and continue to be owned (directly or through majority ownership)\nby EU member states and/or EU nationals and (ii) the air carrier must at all times be effectively controlled by such EU\nmember states or EU nationals. The IAA has broad authority to revoke an operating license. See “Item 10. Additional\nInformation—Limitations on Share Ownership by Non-EU Nationals.” See also “Item 3. Key Information—Risk Factors—\nRisks Related to Ownership of the Company’s Ordinary Shares or ADRs—EU Rules impose restrictions on the ownership\nof Ryanair Holdings’ ordinary shares by Non-EU nationals and the Company has applied a ban on the purchase of\nordinary shares by Non-EU nationals since 2002” above.\nRyanair’s current operating license (No 05/16) was issued by CAR (whose functions were merged with the IAA\non April 30, 2023) on September 20, 2016 and is subject to periodic review.\nDepartment of Transport. The DoT is responsible for implementation of certain EU and Irish legislation and\ninternational standards relating to air transport.\nMalta\nMaltese Civil Aviation Directorate. The Maltese CAD is Malta's aviation regulator, assisting the Maltese Director\nGeneral for Civil Aviation in fostering the development of civil aviation in Malta within a safety oversight system. The\nMaltese CAD is responsible for: the safety of aircraft, aircraft and aerodrome operators, air navigation service providers,\nlicensing of aeronautical personnel and the conclusion of international air services agreements. To operate in the EU, a\nMaltese air carrier is required to hold an AOC granted by the Maltese CAD attesting to the air carrier’s operational and\ntechnical competence to conduct airline services with specified types of aircraft. The Maltese CAD has authority to\namend or revoke the AOC, with Lauda Europe’s and Malta Air’s ability to continue to hold their respective AOCs being\nsubject to ongoing compliance with applicable statutes. Lauda Europe’s and Malta Air’s flight operations, aircraft,\nmaintenance facilities and air crew are subject to ongoing review and inspections by the Maltese CAD.\nThe Company’s subsidiary, Malta Air, obtained an AOC (No. MT-57) and operating license (No. (CAD/MT-57)\nfrom the Maltese CAD on June 12, 2019.\nThe Company’s subsidiary, Lauda Europe, obtained an AOC (No. MT-62) and operating license (No. (CAD/MT-\n62) from the Maltese CAD on September 4, 2020.\nTransport Malta. Transport Malta is a government body overseeing transport in Malta, including the work of the\nMaltese CAD. It is responsible for implementation of certain EU and Maltese legislation and international standards\nrelating to air transport.\n42\nPoland\nPolish Civil Aviation Authority. The Polish CAA is a government body and the civil aviation supervisory authority\nin Poland. Apart from certification and licensing of airlines, the Polish CAA performs operational and regulatory functions\nin all matters relating to qualifications of personnel, safety, security, as well as maintaining registers of aircraft,\npersonnel and training entities, amongst others.\nThe Company’s subsidiary Ryanair Sun S.A., operating as Buzz, obtained an AOC (No. PL-066) and operating\nlicense (No. ULC-LER-1/4000-0156/06/17) from the Polish CAA in April 2018.\nUK\nUK Civil Aviation Authority. The UK CAA is primarily responsible for ensuring safety standards, consumer\nprotection, efficient use of airspace and security risks. A UK air carrier is required to hold an AOC granted by the UK CAA\nattesting to the air carrier’s operational and technical competence to conduct airline services with specified types of\naircraft. The UK CAA has an authority to amend or revoke the AOC, with Ryanair UK’s ability to continue to hold its AOC\nbeing subject to ongoing compliance with applicable statutes. Ryanair UK’s flight operations, aircraft, maintenance\nfacilities and air crew are subject to ongoing review and inspections by the UK CAA.\nThe Company’s subsidiary, Ryanair UK, obtained an AOC (No. GB 2451) and an operating license (OL/A/624)\nfrom the UK CAA on December 20, 2018.\nUK Department for Transport. The UK DfT is responsible for implementation of certain UK legislation and\ninternational standards relating to air transport.\nEuropean Union\nThe European Union Aviation Safety Agency. EASA is an agency of the EU that has been given specific regulatory\nand executive tasks in the field of aviation safety. The purpose of EASA is to draw-up common standards to ensure the\nhighest levels of safety, oversee their uniform application across Europe and promote them at the global level.\nThe European Organization for the Safety of Air Navigation. Eurocontrol is an autonomous international\norganization established under the Eurocontrol Convention of December 13, 1960. Eurocontrol is responsible for, inter\nalia, the safety of air navigation and the collection of charges for air navigation services throughout Europe.\nInternational agreements concerning Eurocontrol provide for the payment of charges to Eurocontrol in respect\nof air navigation services for aircraft in airspace under the control of Eurocontrol. The relevant legislation imposes\nliability for the payment of any charges upon the operators of the aircraft in respect of which services are provided and\nupon the owners of such aircraft or the managers of airports used by such aircraft. The Company’s airline subsidiaries,\nas aircraft operators, are primarily responsible for the payment to Eurocontrol of charges incurred in relation to their\naircraft. The legislation also authorizes the detention of aircraft in the case of default in the payment of any charge for\nair navigation services by the aircraft operator or the aircraft owner, as the case may be. This power of detention extends\nto any equipment, stores or documents, which may be onboard the aircraft when it is detained and may result in the\npossible sale of the aircraft.\nEuropean Commission. The European Commission is the EU body with primary responsibility for the preparation\nof legislative proposals (for adoption by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU) and for the monitoring of\nthe implementation of EU legislation by member states of the EU. The European Commission is also responsible for the\nenforcement of EU competition law and certain other laws.\n43\nThe European Commission has published guidelines on the financing of airports and start-up aid to airlines by\nregional airports that place restrictions on the incentives public airports can offer to airlines delivering traffic, when\ncompared with the commercial freedom available to private airports.\nThe European Union has adopted several legislative acts aimed at modernizing the EU’s air traffic control\nsystem, including the legislative package known as the “single European sky”, and its subsequent amendments “SES2”\nand “SES2+”. For example, EU Regulation 1070/09 (under “SES2”) focused on air traffic control performance, and\nextended the authority of EASA to include airports and air traffic management. The objective of the EU’s policy in this\narea is to enhance safety standards and the overall efficiency of air traffic control in Europe, as well as to reduce the\ncost of air traffic control services.\nThe European Union has also adopted legislation on airport charges (EU Directive 2009/12), which was originally\nintended to address abusive pricing at monopoly airports. However, the legislation includes all European airports with\nover five million passengers per year. Management believes that the scope that exists within this Directive to address\nabuses of their dominant positions by Europe’s larger airports is very limited. See “Item 8. Financial Information⎯Other\nFinancial Information⎯Legal Proceedings⎯EU State Aid-Related Proceedings.”\nEU Regulation 1008/2008 grants EU airlines the freedom to set prices, reinforcing a principle that has\nunderpinned the liberalized EU air transport market since the 1980s. However, in 2020 certain politicians in Austria and\nItaly called for the introduction of minimum prices on airline tickets, while the Italian government in 2023 passed a\ndecree attempting to introduce a price cap on certain flights to Sicily and Sardinia. While none of these measures were\nultimately implemented, it cannot be guaranteed that some form of government intervention in airline fares will not be\nintroduced at a national or European level. If allowed to stand following judicial review, any such restriction would\nseverely impact the Company’s ability to attract the most price sensitive consumers. EU Regulation 1008/2008 also sets\nout rules in respect of transparency of airline fares, requiring the inclusion of all mandatory taxes, fees, and charges in\nadvertised prices. Ryanair includes this information in its advertised fares in all markets where it operates. While\nconsumer benefits of the unbundling of airline services are widely acknowledged, some consumer law enforcement\nauthorities have argued that certain optional price components should be included in advertised prices and/or that\ncertain optional services should be considered mandatory, which, if implemented, would limit the Company’s\ncommercial freedom.\nThe European Union has also passed legislation governing the allocation and use of airport slots, a directive\ngoverning access to the ground handling market at EU airports, a directive on the terms of airlines’ participation in the\nEU Emissions Trading System, regulations on passenger rights and the rights of passengers with reduced mobility, and\nseveral other legislative acts affecting air transport, including matters of aviation security, noise, social security and\nsustainable aviation fuel.\nRegistration of Aircraft\nPursuant to the Irish Aviation Authority (Nationality and Registration of Aircraft) Order 2015 (the “Order”), the\nIAA regulates the registration of aircraft in Ireland. In order to be registered or continue to be registered in Ireland, an\naircraft must be wholly owned by either (i) a citizen of Ireland or a citizen of another member state of the EU having a\nplace of residence or business in Ireland or (ii) a company registered in and having a place of business in Ireland and\nhaving its principal place of business in Ireland or another member state of the EU and not less than two-thirds of the\nDirectors of which are citizens of Ireland or of another member state of the EU. As of the date of this report, all Directors\nof Ryanair Holdings are citizens of a member state of the EU.\nThe Company’s aircraft operated by Malta Air and Lauda Europe are registered in Malta, the aircraft operated by\nBuzz are registered in Poland and the aircraft operated by Ryanair UK are registered in the UK. In each of these countries\n44\nsimilar regulations apply to the registration of aircraft as those described above in relation to aircraft operated by Ryanair\nDAC, which are registered in Ireland.\nRegulation of Competition\nCompetition/Antitrust Law. It is a general principle of EU competition law that no agreement may be concluded\nbetween two or more separate economic undertakings that prevents, restricts, or distorts competition in the common\nmarket or any part of the common market. Such an arrangement may nevertheless be exempted by the European\nCommission, on either an individual or category basis. The second general principle of EU competition law is that any\nbusiness or businesses having a dominant position in the EU common market or any substantial part of the common\nmarket may not abuse such dominant position. Similar competition laws apply at national level in EU member states, as\nwell as in the UK and other non-EU countries where the Company operates. Ryanair is subject to the application of the\ngeneral rules of competition law as well as specific rules on competition in the airline sector.\nAn aggrieved person may sue for breach of competition law in the courts of a member state and/or petition the\nEuropean Commission or a national competition authority for an order to put an end to the breach of competition law.\nThe European Commission and national competition authorities also may impose fines and daily penalties on\nbusinesses and the courts may award damages and other remedies (such as injunctions) in appropriate circumstances.\nCompetition law in Ireland is primarily embodied in the Competition Acts 2002 to 2022. This legislation is\nmodeled on the EU competition law system. The Irish rules generally prohibit anti-competitive arrangements among\nbusinesses and prohibit the abuse of a dominant position. These rules are enforced either by public enforcement\n(primarily by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission) through both criminal and civil sanctions or by\nprivate action in the courts. These rules apply to the airline sector but are subject to EU rules that override any contrary\nprovisions of Irish competition law.\nIn December 2022, the Italian competition authority (the “AGCM”) launched an investigation into alleged illegal\nprice coordination between airlines, including Ryanair, on routes between mainland Italy and Sicily during the Christmas\nperiod. The investigation was closed in late 2023 with no finding of infringement. The AGCM subsequently launched a\nreview of the use of pricing algorithms by airlines, which is ongoing.\nIn September 2023, the AGCM launched an investigation into alleged abuse of dominance by Ryanair in its\ndealings with online and offline “bricks and mortar” travel agents in Italy. The Company has strongly refuted the\nallegation and is engaging with the AGCM whose investigation will likely conclude in late 2024. In the context of this\ninvestigation, in April 2024 the AGCM started interim proceedings to determine whether there exists a risk of irreparable\ndamage to competition during the time required for completing the main investigation, unless interim measures are\nimposed on Ryanair. The AGCM closed these interim proceedings in late May 2024, concluding that there was no basis\nfor the adoption of precautionary measures pending the outcome of the main investigation.\nCertain operators of screenscraping websites (including Lastminute and On the Beach) have alleged in court\nproceedings that Ryanair’s objection to the unauthorized selling of its flight tickets by online travel agents to consumers\nis an attempt to restrict competition. Ryanair is vigorously defending such claims and welcomed the withdrawal by On\nthe Beach of its action in UK courts in February 2024. See “Item 3. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks Related to the\nCompany—The Company faces risks related to unauthorized use of information from the Company’s website”.\nState Aid. EU law sets conditions on which State aid may be granted by EU member states to businesses. The\nEU Treaty prevents member states from granting such aid unless approved in advance by the EU. Any such grant of\nState aid to an airline is subject to challenge before the European Commission or, in certain circumstances, national\n45\ncourts. If aid is held to have been unlawfully granted it may have to be repaid by the airline to the granting member state,\ntogether with interest thereon.\nUnder the terms of the EU—UK TCA, the UK has introduced a new subsidy control regime in order to prevent\ndistortions of competition between the UK and the EU. See “Item 3. Key Information⎯Risk Factors⎯Risks Related to\nthe Company—The Company is subject to legal proceedings alleging state aid at certain airports” and “Item 8. Financial\nInformation⎯Other Financial Information⎯Legal Proceedings.”\nData Protection\nRyanair’s processing of personal data is subject to increasingly complex data protection laws including the EU’s\nGDPR as well as relevant national implementing legislation (Irish Data Protection Act 2018). The GDPR is directly\napplicable across the member states of the EU and an equivalent data protection regime operates in the UK post-Brexit\n(the European Commission has considered the UK regime to be adequate by way of the ‘adequacy decision’ adopted on\nJune 28, 2021). The GDPR imposes strict obligations on companies which process personal data, including\nrequirements to implement appropriate security measures to ensure that processing, storing, and transferring of\npersonal data is done in accordance with the key data protection principles contained in the GDPR. There is an obligation\nto report data breaches which are likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons (and in some\ninstances an obligation to inform the data subjects) within stipulated timeframes. The GDPR also provides data subjects\nwith enhanced rights in respect of their personal data, such as the “right to be forgotten” (to be erased from the\ndatabases of organizations holding their personal data, including erased from third party providers’ databases, provided\nthere are no legitimate grounds for retaining the personal data) and the right to “data portability” (the right to receive the\npersonal data concerning the data subject in a structured and commonly used and machine-readable format and to\ntransmit that data to a nominated third party).\nA breach of the GDPR may result in the imposition of fines by supervisory authorities up to €20m or 4% of annual\ngroup-wide turnover (whichever is higher). Supervisory authorities also have the power to audit businesses and require\nmeasures to be taken by businesses to rectify any non-compliance (which can include orders to suspend data\nprocessing activities). Additionally, data subjects are entitled to seek compensation for any damage (including non-\nmaterial damage) suffered in the event that the processing of their personal data is in breach of the GDPR’s\nrequirements. See “Item 3. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Company—Ryanair is subject to\nincreasingly complex data protection laws and regulations”.\nConsumer Protection\nRyanair operates under stringent consumer protection laws. Despite diligent efforts to ensure full compliance,\nthere is a possibility that government bodies or other entities might claim non-compliance with these laws by Ryanair.\nCertain authorities across Ryanair’s network have the power to conduct audits and demand corrective actions for any\nnon-compliance. A significant breach by Ryanair of consumer laws could lead to authorities imposing fines of up to 10%\nof the annual group-wide turnover, or the issuing of strict compliance orders. Furthermore, consumers have the right to\nseek damages for any harm caused by a breach of their consumer rights and may also be represented in collective\nredress or class actions. Such cases, whether individually or collectively, could materially and adversely affect the\nCompany's financial condition and operational results. See “Item 3. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks Related to the\nCompany—The Company is subject to increasingly strict sanctions for non-compliance with consumer protection laws”.\n46\nEnvironmental Regulation\nAircraft Noise Regulations. Ryanair is subject to international, national and, in some cases, local noise regulation\nstandards. EU and Irish regulations have required that all aircraft operated by Ryanair comply with Stage 3 noise\nrequirements. All of Ryanair’s aircraft currently comply with these regulations. Many airports in Ryanair’s network\n(including London Stansted, London Gatwick, Rome Ciampino, Dublin and Amsterdam) have established local noise\nrestrictions, including limits on the number of hourly or daily operations or the time of such operations.\nCompany Facilities. The Company maintains facilities across its network, including engineering facilities at the\nairports in Dublin, Shannon, Malta, Glasgow (Prestwick), London (Stansted), Frankfurt (Hahn), Nuremberg, Bergamo,\nWroclaw, Kaunas, Seville, Madrid, Porto and Vienna. Planning permissions for Company facilities have been obtained in\naccordance with local requirements and management of noxious or potentially toxic substances as well as of waste\nremoval is conducted in adherence to applicable local, national and EU regulations.\nRyanair’s Policy on Noise and Emissions. Ryanair is committed to reducing emissions and noise through\ninvestments in new, efficient aircraft and engine technologies and the implementation of certain operational and\ncommercial decisions to minimize the environmental impact of its operations. The Company is constantly working\ntowards improving its environmental performance and in February 2024, was upgraded to a Leadership Level ‘A-’ rating\n(was “B”) from CDP – an international non-profit that helps organizations to disclose their environmental impact.\nIn December 2005, Ryanair completed the fleet replacement program it commenced in 1999. All of Ryanair’s\nolder Boeing 737-200A aircraft were replaced with Boeing 737-800 “next generation” (“NG”) aircraft. The design of these\naircraft is aimed at minimizing drag, thereby reducing the rate of fuel burn and noise levels. The engines are also quieter\nand more fuel-efficient. The Boeing 737-800NG aircraft have a significantly superior fuel-burn to passenger-kilometer\nratio than Ryanair’s former fleet of Boeing 737-200A aircraft. Ryanair has installed winglets on all of its Boeing 737-\n800NG aircraft. Winglets reduce both the rate of fuel burn and carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 4%, and also\nreduce noise emissions. In fiscal year 2023, Ryanair began to retro-fit scimitar winglets on the Boeing 737-800NG fleet.\nThis retro-fit program will further reduce fuel burn of these aircraft by approximately 1.5% and noise by approximately\n6%.\nIn September 2014, Ryanair entered into an agreement with Boeing to purchase up to 200 Boeing 737-8200\n“Gamechanger” aircraft (including 100 firm orders and 100 aircraft subject to option). The contract was approved by the\nshareholders of the Company at an extraordinary general meeting (“EGM”) on November 28, 2014. In June 2017, the\nGroup agreed to purchase an additional 10 Boeing 737-8200 aircraft. In April 2018, the Company announced that it had\nconverted 25 Boeing 737-8200 options into firm orders. In December 2020, the Company announced that it had\nconverted the remaining 75 options to firm orders. This brought the Company’s firm order to 210 Boeing 737-8200s with\na total contract value of approximately U.S.$9.6bn at standard list price of U.S.$102.5m per aircraft (net of basic credits\nand reflective of price escalation over the originally scheduled delivery timeframe). These aircraft have 197 seats and\nare fitted with CFM-LEAP-1B engines which, combined with the Advanced Technology winglet and other aerodynamic\nimprovements, reduce fuel consumption by up to approximately 16% on a per seat basis compared to the Boeing 737-\n800NGs in Ryanair’s configuration and reduce operational noise emissions by up to 50%. See “—Aircraft” above for\ndetails on Ryanair’s fleet plan.\nIn May 2023, Ryanair signed an agreement with Boeing to purchase up to 300 Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft\n(including 150 firm orders and 150 aircraft subject to option) for delivery between 2027 and 2033. This agreement was\napproved by Shareholders at the Company’s 2023 AGM. These aircraft have 228 seats and are fitted with CFM-LEAP-1B\nengines, which reduce fuel consumption by up to approximately 20% compared to the Boeing 737-800NG and reduce\nnoise emissions by approximately 50%. It is expected that up to 50% of this order will replace older aircraft in the fleet\n47\n(including lease handbacks), while the remainder will facilitate disciplined traffic growth to approximately 300m\npassengers per annum by fiscal year 2034.\nIn addition, Ryanair has distinctive operational characteristics that management believes help reduce the\nCompany’s impact on the environment. In particular, Ryanair:\n• operates with a high-seat density of 189 seats on the Boeing 737-800NGs and 197 on the Boeing 737-8200\naircraft. This is in contrast to the 162 seats and two-class configuration of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft used\nby traditional network airlines, reducing fuel burn and emissions per passenger/kilometer. The Lauda A320\nfleet has a high density of 180 seats;\n• has reduced per passenger/Km emissions through high load factors (94% in fiscal year 2024);\n• achieves quick turn-around times, thus reducing fuel burn and emissions when aircraft are on the ground;\n• provides mainly direct services as opposed to connecting flights, in order to limit the need for passengers\nto transfer at main hubs and thus reduces the number of take-offs and landings per journey from four to\ntwo, reducing fuel burn and emissions per journey; and\n• has minimal scheduled late-night departures of aircraft, reducing the impact of noise emissions.\nIn 2021, a law was passed in France prohibiting domestic flights where an alternative direct train service\noperates in under 2.5 hours, with an exception made for connecting flights. The European Commission found this\ndistorted competition between point to point carriers and network operators. Consequently, France amended the law to\nremove this exemption for connecting flights. The new formulation of the law de facto means that only 3 routes to Paris\nOrly airport (where the Company does not operate) are affected. The European Commission approved this law in\nDecember 2022. It entered into force on May 24, 2023 for a period of three years. Ryanair does not believe that any such\nmeasures can in fact make a significant contribution to reducing aviation’s environmental impact given that over half of\nall emissions from European aviation come from long-haul flights (which account for just a few percent of total European\nflights) and has argued that policy-makers should instead focus on measures that discourage connecting flights, the\nmost environmentally inefficient form of air travel. A widespread introduction of bans on short-haul flights could have a\nnegative impact on the Company’s results and operations.\n“Fit for 55”. We engage with European decision makers to support a fair green transition of the aviation sector.\nAmong the measures included in the “Fit for 55” package, we welcome the legislation to increase the use of SAF and\nengaged relevant stakeholders to stress the importance of using sustainable fuels to cut the sector’s carbon footprint.\nWe have highlighted the limited environmental benefit and the harmful consequences for the EU economy and\nconnectivity resulting from other elements of the package, e.g., a kerosene tax that applies only to intra-EU flights. In\nDecember 2022, the European Parliament, the Council of Europe and the European Commission reached a political\nagreement to apply the ETS exclusively to intra-EEA flights until at least 2027. In 2026, the European Commission will\nagain assess and review the geographic scope of the ETS with the view potentially to including long-haul flights within\nthe scope.\nEmissions Trading. On November 19, 2008, the European Union adopted legislation to add aviation to the EU\nETS as of 2012. This scheme, which had previously applied mainly to energy producers, is a cap-and-trade system for\nCO2 emissions to encourage industries to improve their CO2 efficiency. Under the legislation, airlines were granted initial\nfree CO2 allowances based on historical “revenue tonne kilometres” and a CO2 efficiency benchmark. Any shortage of\nallowances has to be purchased in the open market and/or at government auctions. Management believes that this\nlegislation has a negative impact on the European airline industry as it does not sufficiently promote environmentally\nefficient growth. The free CO2 allowances are being phased out between 2024 and 2026, which will increase the cost of\ncompliance by the Company with the ETS.\n48\nOn January 1, 2021, a UK ETS replaced the UK’s participation in the EU ETS (in principle covering UK domestic\nflights and flights from the UK to the EU, while EU ETS still applies on flights from the EU to the UK, regardless of the\nnationality of the operating carrier). This scheme contains many consistent features with the concurrent EU ETS. Airlines\nhave been granted allowances under the scheme with a subsequent deduction in allocated free EU ETS allowances.\nThese were distributed in proportion to UK ETS activity based on historical “revenue tonne kilometre”. The UK has\nannounced it plans to phase out the free CO2 allowances from 2026.\nCarbon Offsetting. On October 6, 2016, the CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International\nAviation) agreement was agreed between 191 ICAO countries. The CORSIA scheme uses market-based environmental\npolicy instruments (carbon credits) to offset CO2 emissions above the 2019 levels, starting from 2021 to 2023, and\nabove 85% of 2019 levels from 2024 to 2035. The scheme is voluntary for ICAO countries until 2026. As of June 2024,\n126 out of 191 countries decided to participate.\nRyanair takes its environmental responsibilities seriously and intends to continue to improve its environmental\nefficiency and to minimize emissions. Under Regulation 7 of The UK Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and\nDirectors’ Report) Regulations 2013, Ryanair is obliged to state its annual quantity of emissions in tons of carbon dioxide\nequivalent. Ryanair’s EU and UK Emissions Trading Scheme monitoring, reporting and allowance surrender obligations\nare mandated on a calendar year basis. During calendar year 2023, the Ryanair Group emitted 15.0m tCO2 (calendar\n2022: 13.6m tCO2), which equates to 0.082 tCO2 (calendar 2022: 0.085) per passenger (a drop of over 3.5% per\npassenger).\nAviation Taxes. Ryanair is fundamentally opposed to the introduction of additional aviation taxes, including new\nenvironmental taxes, fuel taxes or emissions levies. Ryanair has offered, and continues to offer, among the lowest fares\nin Europe, to make passenger air travel affordable and accessible to European consumers. Ryanair remitted over\n€1.17bn in various environmental taxes in fiscal year 2024 up from approximately €0.83bn in fiscal year 2023 (and\napproximately €0.26bn in fiscal year 2022). Ryanair believes that the imposition of additional taxes on airlines will not\nonly increase airfares, but will discourage new entrants into the market, resulting in less choice for consumers. Ryanair\nbelieves this would ultimately have adverse effects on the European economy in general.\nAs a company, Ryanair believes in free market competition and that aviation taxation distorts competition by\nfavoring the less efficient flag carriers which generally have smaller and older aircraft, lower load factors, which offer\nconnecting flights and operate primarily into congested airports, and which, as a result, have a much higher fuel burn\nper passenger. Furthermore, the introduction of a tax at a European level only, such as that proposed under the ETD,\nwould distort competition between airlines operating solely within Europe and those operating also long-haul flights to\nand from Europe.\nAirport charges\nThe EU Airport Charges Directive of March 2009 sets forth general principles that are to be followed by airports\nwith more than 5m passengers per annum, and the airport with the highest passenger movement in each Member State,\nwhen setting airport charges, and provides for an appeals procedure for airlines in the event that they are not satisfied\nwith the level of charges. However, Ryanair does not believe that this procedure is effective or that it constrains those\nairports that are currently abusing their dominant position, in part because the legislation was transposed improperly in\ncertain countries, such as Ireland and Spain, thereby depriving airlines of even the basic safeguards provided for in the\nDirective. This legislation may in fact lead to higher airport charges, depending on how its provisions are applied by EU\nmember states and subsequently by the courts.\n49\nSlots\nCurrently, many of Ryanair Group’s airports have no “slot” allocation restrictions; however, a substantial number\nof the airports the Ryanair Group airlines serve, including its primary bases, are regulated by means of “slot” allocations,\nwhich represent authorizations to take off or land at a particular airport within a specified time period. EU law regulates\nthe acquisition, transfer and loss of slots. Under EU Regulation No. 793/2004, slots may be transferred from one route\nto another by the same carrier, transferred within a group or as part of a change of control of a carrier, or swapped\nbetween carriers. In April 2008, the European Commission issued a communication on the application of the slot\nregulation, signaling the acceptance of secondary trading of airport slots between airlines. This was intended to allow\nmore flexibility and mobility in the use of slots and further enhance possibilities for market entry at slot constrained\nairports. Any future legislation that might create an official secondary market for slots could create a potential source\nof revenue for certain of Ryanair’s current and potential competitors, many of which have many more slots allocated at\nprimary airports at present than Ryanair. The European Commission proposed a revision to the slots’ legislation\nreflecting the principle of secondary trading. This revision has been negotiated by the EU institutions since 2014 and is\ncurrently stalled. Slot values depend on several factors, including the airport, time of day covered, the availability of slots\nand the class of aircraft. Ryanair’s ability to gain access to and develop its operations at slot-controlled airports will be\naffected by the availability of slots for takeoffs and landings at these specific airports. New entrants to an airport are\ncurrently given certain privileges in terms of obtaining slots, but such privileges are subject to the grandfathered rights\nof existing operators that are utilizing their slots. In March 2020, the European Union suspended the “80/20 use it or lose\nit” rule for the IATA summer season 2020 due to the Covid-19 crisis. The “80/20” rule provides that an airline is entitled\nto the same slot in the next equivalent scheduling period if it has used the allocated slot 80% of the time. The suspension\nof the “80/20” rule has been phased out and restored from the IATA summer season 2023. There is no assurance that\nthe Ryanair Group will be able to obtain a sufficient number of slots at the slot-controlled airports that it desires to serve\nin the future at the time it needs them or on acceptable terms.\nOther\nThe Company transitioned to local contracts of employment in a number of EU countries in recent years. Where\nthis transition has occurred, the Company is subject to local laws and regulations (examples below).\nHealth and occupational safety issues relating to Ryanair employees employed under Irish law are addressed in\nIreland by the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 (as amended) and other regulations under that Act. Although\nlicenses or permits are not issued under such legislation, compliance is monitored by the Health and Safety Authority\n(the “Authority”), which is the regulating body in this area. The Authority periodically reviews Ryanair DAC’s health and\nsafety record and when appropriate, issues improvement notices or prohibition notices. Ryanair DAC has responded to\nall such notices to the satisfaction of the Authority.\nFor Malta Air and Lauda Europe, health and occupational safety issues are addressed in the Maltese\nOccupational Health and Safety Authority Act XXVII of 2000. Compliance is monitored by the Occupational Health and\nSafety Authority (“OHSA”), which enforces the law in workplaces. OHSA advises the Minister responsible for\noccupational health and safety regarding the making of regulations to promote, maintain and protect a high level of\noccupational health and safety, as well as takes enforcement action. OHSA can also carry out investigations on any\nmatter concerning occupational health and safety.\nThe Polish Labor Code covers health and occupational safety issues. Under Article 184 of the Labor Code,\ncompliance with provisions on health and occupational safety is monitored by the National Labor Inspectorate\n(“Państwowa Inspekcja Pracy”) and the National Sanitary Inspectorate (“Państwowa Inspekcja Sanitarna”).\n50\nOccupational health and safety issues relating to Ryanair UK are governed by various legislation, the primary\nstatute in England being the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (the “Health and Safety at Work Act”). The Health\nand Safety Executive (“HSE”), monitors compliance with the Health and Safety at Work Act and related legislation.\nDESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY\nFor certain information about each of the Company’s key facilities, see “—Facilities” above. Management\nbelieves that the Company’s facilities are suitable for its needs and are well maintained.\nItem 4A. Unresolved Staff Comments\nThere are no unresolved staff comments.\nItem 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of\nthe Company and the notes thereto included in Item 18. Those consolidated financial statements have been prepared\nin accordance with IFRS.\nHISTORY\nRyanair’s current business strategy dates to the early 1990s, when Ryanair became the first European airline to\nreplicate the low-fares, low-cost operating model pioneered by Southwest Airlines Co. in the United States. During the\nperiod between 1992 and 1994, Ryanair expanded its route network to include scheduled passenger services between\nDublin and Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow (Prestwick). In 1994, Ryanair began standardizing its fleet by\npurchasing used Boeing 737-200A aircraft to replace substantially all of its leased aircraft. Beginning in 1996, Ryanair\ncontinued to expand its service from Dublin to new provincial destinations in the UK. Ryanair Holdings completed its\ninitial public offering in June 1997.\nFrom 1997 through March 31, 2024, the Ryanair Group launched services on more than 2,500 routes throughout\nEurope and also increased the frequency of service on a number of its principal routes. Ryanair has established 95\nairports as bases of operations. See “Item 4. Information on the Company—Route System, Scheduling and Fares” for a\nlist of these bases. During fiscal years 2019 and 2020 the Company established a low-cost airline group adding startup\nairlines in Poland (Buzz) and the UK (Ryanair UK), along with the acquisition of Lauda and Malta Air (both now based in\nMalta), to Ryanair DAC in Ireland. Ryanair has increased the number of booked passengers from approximately 5m in\nfiscal year 1999 to approximately 184m in fiscal year 2024. As of March 31, 2024, Ryanair had a principal fleet of 557\nBoeing 737 (including 146 Boeing 737-8200 “Gamechangers”) aircraft and 27 Airbus A320 aircraft and serves\napproximately 235 airports.\nRyanair expects to have approximately 800 narrow-body aircraft in its operating fleet by 2034 following the\ndelivery of all of the Boeing 737s currently on order, subject to lease hand-backs and disposals over the period. See\n“Item 4. Information on the Company—Aircraft” and “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Liquidity\nand Capital Resources” below for additional details.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nSince Ryanair pioneered its low-cost operating model in Europe in the early 1990s, its passenger volumes and\nscheduled passenger revenues have increased significantly because the Company has substantially increased capacity\n51\nand demand has been sufficient to match the increased capacity. Ryanair’s annual booked passenger volume has grown\nfrom approximately 1m passengers in 1991 to approximately 184m passengers in fiscal year 2024.\nTotal revenues increased from €10.78bn in fiscal year 2023 to €13.44bn in fiscal year 2024 primarily due to a\n9% increase in traffic to 183.7m passengers. Average fares in fiscal year 2024 were up 21% to c.€49.80. Ancillary\nrevenues increased by 12% to €4.30bn due to the increase in traffic and a solid performance in discretionary products\nsuch as priority boarding, reserved seating and in-flight sales.\nRyanair’s total break-even load factor was 81% in fiscal year 2023 and 80% in fiscal year 2024. Ryanair recorded\nan operating profit of €1.44bn in fiscal year 2023 and an operating profit of €2.06bn in fiscal year 2024. The Company\nrecorded a profit after tax of €1.31bn in fiscal year 2023 and a profit after tax of €1.92bn in fiscal year 2024.\nHistorical results are not predictive of future results\nThe historical results of operations discussed herein may not be indicative of Ryanair’s future operating\nperformance. Ryanair’s future results of operations will be affected by, among other things, fuel prices; the airline pricing\nenvironment in a period of increased competition; flight disruptions and other global economic impacts caused by the\nwar in Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict; overall passenger traffic volume; the availability of new airports for\nexpansion; the ability of Ryanair to finance its planned acquisition of aircraft and to discharge the resulting debt service\nobligations; economic and political conditions in Ireland, the UK and the EU including a high interest rate environment;\nthe ability of the Company to generate profits for new acquisitions; terrorist threats or attacks (including cyber-attacks)\nwithin the EU; seasonal variations in travel; developments in government regulations, litigation and labor relations;\nforeign currency fluctuations; potential break-up of the Eurozone; Brexit; global inflation and supply chain pressures; the\navailability of aircraft; competition and the public’s perception regarding the safety of low-fares airlines; changes in\naircraft acquisition, leasing, and other operating costs; flight interruptions caused by extreme weather events or other\natmospheric disruptions; aircraft safety concerns; flight disruptions caused by periodic and prolonged ATC strikes in\nEurope; the rates of income and corporate taxes paid, the financial impact of the Covid-19 crisis and the Russian invasion\nof Ukraine on European economies. Ryanair expects its depreciation, staff, fuel and route charges to increase as\nadditional aircraft and related flight equipment are acquired. Future fuel costs may also increase as a result of the\ndepletion of petroleum reserves, the shortage of fuel production capacity, production restrictions imposed by fuel oil\nproducers, sanctions imposed on oil producers, geopolitical tensions affecting oil producing countries and the\nimposition of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandates by the EU and UK Government. Maintenance expenses may also\nincrease as a result of Ryanair’s fleet expansion and replacement program. The cost of insurance coverage for certain\nthird-party liabilities arising from “acts of war” or terrorism increased dramatically following the September 11, 2001\nterrorist attacks. In addition, the financing of new Boeing 737-8200 aircraft and Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft may\nincrease the total amount of the Company’s outstanding debt and the payments it is obliged to make to service such\ndebt.\n52\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement data (calculated under IFRS) for Ryanair expressed as\na percentage of Ryanair’s total revenues for each of the periods indicated:\nFisc al Y ear ended Ma rch 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nTotal revenues 100 % 100 % 100 %\nScheduled revenues 68 64 55\nAncillary revenues 32 36 45\nTotal operating expenses 85 87 107\nFuel and oil 38 37 35\nStaff costs 11 11 14\nAirport and handling charges 11 12 17\nDepreciation 8 9 15\nRoute charges 8 8 11\nMarketing, distribution and other 6 6 9\nMaintenance, materials and repairs 3 3 5\nOperating profit/(loss) 15 13 (7)\nNet finance income/(expense) 1 0 (2)\nProfit/(loss) before tax 16 13 (9)\nTax (expense)/credit (2) (1) 4\nProfit/(loss) after taxation 14 12 (5)\nFISCAL YEAR 2024 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2023\nProfit after taxation. Ryanair recorded a profit after taxation of €1,917m in fiscal year 2024, as compared with a\nprofit after taxation of €1,314m in fiscal year 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to a 9% increase in traffic at\n21% higher average fares offset by increased jet fuel costs.\nScheduled revenues. Ryanair's scheduled passenger revenues increased by 32%, from €6,930m in fiscal year\n2023 to €9,145m in fiscal year 2024, primarily reflecting a 9% increase in traffic to 183.7m passengers and a 21%\nincrease in average fare to c.€49.80.\nScheduled passenger revenues accounted for 68% of Ryanair’s total revenues in fiscal year 2024 and 64% in\nfiscal year 2023.\nAncillary revenues. Ryanair's ancillary revenues, which comprise revenues from non-flight scheduled operations,\nin-flight sales and internet-related services, increased by 12%, from €3,845m in fiscal year 2023 to €4,299m in fiscal year\n2024. The overall increase in ancillary revenues was due to a 9% increase in traffic to 183.7m passengers and a solid\nperformance in discretionary products such as priority boarding, reserved seating and in-flight sales.\nOperating expenses. As a percentage of total revenues, Ryanair's operating expenses were at 85% for fiscal year 2024\nand 87% for fiscal year 2023. In absolute terms, total operating expenses increased by 22%, from €9,333m in fiscal year\n2023 to €11,383m in fiscal year 2024, principally as a result of an increase in sectors flown and higher fuel costs. When\ncomparing costs as a percentage of total revenues, staff costs, route charges, marketing, distribution and other and\nmaintenance, materials and repairs remained in line with fiscal year 2023. Fuel increased as a percentage of total\nrevenues primarily due to higher jet fuel prices offset by fuel burn savings on the new Boeing 737-8200 aircraft.\nDepreciation and airport and handling charges decreased as a percentage of total revenues due to the 21% increase in\naverage fares.\n53\nThe following table sets forth the amounts in euro cent of, and percentage changes in, Ryanair's operating\nexpenses (on a per passenger basis) for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 under IFRS. This data is calculated by dividing the\nrelevant expense amount (as shown in the consolidated financial statements) by the number of booked passengers in\nthe relevant year as shown in the table of “Selected Operating and Other Data” in Item 3 and rounding to the nearest euro\ncent; the percentage change is calculated on the basis of the relevant figures before rounding.\nAt M arch 31,\n2024 2023 % Change *\n€ €\nFuel and oil 27.99 23.88 (17)%\nStaff costs 8.16 7.07 (16)%\nAirport and handling charges 8.08 7.36 (10)%\nDepreciation 5.77 5.48 (5)%\nRoute charges 5.58 5.36 (4)%\nMarketing, distribution and other 4.12 4.00 (3)%\nMaintenance, materials and repairs 2.26 2.22 (2)%\nTotal operating expenses 61.96 55.37 (12)%\n* ”+” is favorable and “-“ is adverse year-on-year.\nFuel and oil. Ryanair's fuel and oil costs per passenger increased by 17%, while in absolute terms, these costs\nincreased by 28% from €4,026m in fiscal year 2023 to €5,143m in fiscal year 2024. The 28% increase reflected an\nincrease in sectors flown and significantly higher jet fuel prices offset by fuel burn savings on the new Boeing 737-8200\naircraft. Fuel and oil costs include the direct cost of fuel, the cost of delivering fuel to the aircraft, aircraft de-icing and\nemissions trading costs (both EU and UK). The average fuel price paid by Ryanair (calculated by dividing total fuel costs\n(including into-plane and carbon charges) by the number of U.S. gallons of fuel consumed) increased by 31% from €2.46\nper U.S. gallon in fiscal year 2023 to €3.23 per U.S. gallon in fiscal year 2024.\nStaff costs. Ryanair's staff costs, which consist primarily of salaries, wages and benefits, increased by 16% on\na per passenger basis, while in absolute terms, these costs increased by 26%, from €1,191m in fiscal year 2023 to\n€1,500m in fiscal year 2024. The increase in absolute terms was primarily attributable to the larger fleet, higher sectors,\ninvestment in operational resilience with higher crewing ratios, restoration of Covid-19 pay reductions, crew productivity\npay increases implemented and Boeing delivery delays.\nAirport and handling charges. Ryanair's airport and handling charges per passenger increased by 10% in fiscal\nyear 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023. In absolute terms, airport and handling charges increased by 20%, from\n€1,241m in fiscal year 2023 to €1,485m in fiscal year 2024 due to 9% traffic growth, higher ground ATC and handling\nrates, and termination of temporary Covid reliefs (included in the prior year comparative).\nDepreciation. Ryanair's depreciation per passenger increased by 5%, while in absolute terms these costs\nincreased by 15% from €923m in fiscal year 2023 to €1,060m in fiscal year 2024. The increase was primarily due to\nhigher amortisation resulting from the delivery of 48 new “Gamechanger” aircraft and higher aircraft utilisation (flight\nhours up 9%).\nRoute charges. Ryanair's route charges per passenger increased by 4%. In absolute terms, route charges\nincreased by 13%, from €904m in fiscal year 2023 to €1,024m in fiscal year 2024, due to the 9% increase in flight hours\nand higher Eurocontrol rates.\nMarketing, distribution and other expenses. Ryanair's marketing, distribution and other operating expenses,\nincluding those applicable to the generation of ancillary revenues, increased by 3% on a per passenger basis in fiscal\nyear 2024, while in absolute terms, these costs increased by 12%, from €674m in fiscal year 2023 to €757m in fiscal\n54\nyear 2024, due to higher activity in the year (including increased credit card transactions and higher in-flight sales) and\nincreased EU261 and right-to-care passenger compensation due to delays arising primarily from the knock-on effect of\nATC related disruptions (including the NATS system failure in August 2023, and a record number of French ATC strikes).\nMaintenance, materials and repairs. Ryanair's maintenance, materials and repair expenses increased by 2% on a\nper passenger basis, while in absolute terms these expenses increased by 11% from €374m in fiscal year 2023 to €415m\nin fiscal year 2024. The increase in absolute terms during the fiscal year was due to higher utilisation, engineering pay\nincreases and lease handback costs.\nOperating profit/(loss). As a result of the factors outlined above, an operating profit per passenger of €11.22\nwas recorded in fiscal year 2024 compared to an operating profit per passenger of €8.56 in fiscal year 2023.\nNet finance income/(expense). Ryanair’s net finance income was positive at €62m due to higher deposit interest\nrates, lower gross debt, and a positive net cash position throughout the year. Foreign exchange translation reflects the\nimpact of €/US$ exchange rate movements on balance sheet revaluations.\nTaxation. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 was approximately 10%, as compared to an effective tax\nrate of approximately 9% in fiscal year 2023, reflecting the mix of profits and losses incurred by Ryanair’s operating\nsubsidiaries primarily in Ireland, Malta, Poland and the UK.\nFISCAL YEAR 2023 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2022\nA discussion of fiscal year 2023 compared with fiscal year 2022 is included in Ryanair’s 2023 Annual Report\nand Form 20-F.\nSEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS\nThe Company’s results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management expects\nthese variations to continue. Among the factors causing these variations are the airline industry’s sensitivity to general\neconomic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel. Ryanair typically records higher revenues and income in the\nfirst half of each fiscal year ended March 31 than the second half of such year.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nPlease see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 18 for information on recently\nissued accounting standards and whether they are material to the Company.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity. The Company finances its working capital requirements through a combination of cash generated\nfrom operations, debt capital market issuances and bank loans for general corporate purposes. See “Item 3. Key\nInformation— Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Company—The Company will incur significant costs acquiring new\naircraft and any instability in the credit and capital markets could negatively impact Ryanair’s ability to obtain financing\non acceptable terms” for more information about risks relating to liquidity and capital resources. The Company had\ngross cash resources at March 31, 2024 and 2023 of €4.12bn and €4.68bn, respectively. The €0.56bn decrease in gross\ncash resources year on year reflects capital expenditure of approximately €2.39bn and debt repayments of €1.10bn\noffset by an increase in operating activities.\n55\nThe Company’s net cash inflow from operating activities in fiscal year 2024 amounted to €3.16bn (fiscal year\n2023: €3.89bn). The €0.73bn decrease in net cash flows from operating activities year on year primarily reflects the\nmovement in forward bookings.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, Ryanair’s primary cash requirements have been for operating expenses, capital\nexpenditures and payments on indebtedness. Cash generated from operations were the primary sources of cash inflows\nin fiscal year 2024. In fiscal year 2023, Ryanair’s primary cash requirements were for operating expenses, capital\nexpenditures and payments on indebtedness. Cash generated from operations were the primary sources of cash inflows\nfor fiscal year 2023.\nThe Company’s net cash outflow from investing activities in fiscal year 2024 totaled €1.56bn, primarily reflecting\n48 aircraft deliveries, aircraft pre-delivery deposits and capitalized maintenance. The Company’s net cash outflow from\ninvesting activities in fiscal year 2023 totaled €1.90bn, primarily reflecting 37 aircraft deliveries, aircraft pre-delivery\ndeposits and capitalized maintenance.\nNet cash outflows from financing activities totaled €1.33bn in fiscal year 2024, largely reflecting the repayment\nof the Group’s €0.75bn (2015) Eurobond issued at a coupon of 1.125%, €0.26bn of the Group’s €0.75bn revolving credit\nfacility and an interim dividend payment of €0.20bn. Net cash outflows from financing activities totaled €1.05bn in fiscal\nyear 2023, largely reflecting the repayment of the Group’s €0.85bn (2015) Eurobond issued at a coupon of 1.125%.\nCapital Expenditures. Capital Expenditures in fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were €2.39bn and €1.92bn respectively.\nAt March 31, 2024, 100% of Ryanair’s owned Boeing 737s were unencumbered. Ryanair has generally been able to\ngenerate sufficient funds from operations to meet its non-aircraft acquisition-related working capital requirements.\nManagement believes that the working capital available to the Company is sufficient for its present requirements and\nwill be sufficient to meet its anticipated requirements for capital expenditures and other cash requirements for fiscal\nyear 2025.\nThe following table sets forth the dates on which and the number of aircraft that will be delivered, returned and\ndisposed by the Company.\nAt Ma rc h 31,\nFiscal Year End 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030-2034 Total\nOpening Fleet 537 584 645 644 652 667 681 537\nFirm deliveries under 2014 Boeing Contract 48 64 — — — — — 112\nDeliveries under 2023 Boeing Contract* — — — 8 20 40 232 300\nPlanned Disposals or lease returns** (1) (3) (1) — (5) (26) (113) (149)\nClosing Fleet 584 645 644 652 667 681 800 800\n*150 aircraft are firm orders and 150 are subject to an option exercisable at Ryanair’s discretion.\n**Subsequent to March 31, 2024, 3 aircraft leases due to end in fiscal year 2025 were extended to fiscal year 2029.\nCapital Resources. Ryanair’s debt (including current maturities) totaled €2.75bn at March 31, 2024 and €4.12bn\nat March 31, 2023, with the change being primarily attributable to the repayment of the Group’s €0.75bn (2015) Eurobond\nissued at a coupon of 1.125% and €0.26bn of the Group’s €0.75bn revolving credit facility. Please see the table\n“Obligations Due by Period” on page 58 for more information on Ryanair’s long-term debt (including current maturities)\nand leases as of March 31, 2024. See also Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 18 for\nfurther information on the maturity profile of the interest rate structure and other information on the Company’s\nborrowings.\n56\nRyanair expects to finance the remaining aircraft under the 2014 Boeing Contract and the 2023 Boeing Contract\nfrom internally generated cash flows, however the Group will remain opportunistic in its financing strategy and will\nconsider various financing options closer to the time of the respective delivery dates as may be considered appropriate.\nRyanair’s ability to obtain additional loans to finance aircraft purchases is subject to the issuance of further bank\ncommitments and the satisfaction of various contractual conditions. These conditions include, among other things, the\nexecution of satisfactory documentation, the requirement that Ryanair perform all of its obligations under the Boeing\nagreements and that Ryanair not suffer a material adverse change in its conditions or prospects (financial or otherwise).\nIn addition, as a result of the Company’s strong investment grade BBB+ (stable outlook) credit rating from both Standard\n& Poor’s (“S&P”) and Fitch Ratings and following Ryanair’s issuance of €0.75bn in 1.125% unsecured Eurobonds with an\n6.5-year tenor in February 2017 (repaid in August 2023), issuance of €0.85bn in 2.875% unsecured Eurobonds with a 5-\nyear tenor in September 2020 and €1.20bn unsecured Eurobonds with a 5-year tenor at a coupon of 0.875% in May 2021\nunder its EMTN program, the Company may decide in the future to issue additional debt from capital markets to finance\nfuture aircraft deliveries.\nRyanair has a track record in securing finance for similar sized aircraft purchases. Of the 741 aircraft acquired\nunder the 1998, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2013 and 2014 Boeing Contracts, 348 were financed with approximately 66% US Ex-\nIm Bank (the “Ex-Im Bank”) loan guarantees via the bank and capital markets (with 85% loan to value), approximately\n24% through sales and operating leaseback financing, and approximately 10% through Japanese operating leases with\ncall options (“JOLCOs”) and commercial debt. These sources of funding continue to be available to the Company. See\n“Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\nAt March 31, 2024, Ryanair had 27 leased Airbus A320 aircraft in the Lauda Europe fleet and 1 leased Boeing\n737 aircraft in the Ryanair DAC fleet. As a result, Ryanair operates, but does not own, these aircraft, which were leased\nto provide flexibility for the aircraft delivery program. Ryanair has no right or obligation to acquire these aircraft at the\nend of the relevant lease terms. All 28 leases are U.S. dollar-denominated and require Ryanair to make fixed rental\npayments and, following the adoption of IFRS 16 are shown as lease liabilities on the Group’s balance sheet (with related\nright of use assets also recognized).\nSince, under each of the Group’s leases, the Group has a commitment to maintain the relevant aircraft, an\naccounting provision is made during the lease term for this obligation based on estimated future costs of major airframe\nchecks, engine maintenance checks and restitution of major life limited parts by making appropriate charges to the\nincome statement calculated by reference to the number of hours or cycles operated during the year.\nRyanair currently has a corporate rating of BBB+ (stable outlook) from both S&P and Fitch Ratings and a €6bn\nEMTN program. Ryanair issued €0.75bn in unsecured Eurobonds with a 6.5-year tenor at a coupon of 1.125% in February\n2017 (repaid in August 2023), €0.85bn in unsecured Eurobonds with a 5-year tenor at a coupon of 2.875% in September\n2020, and €1.20bn in unsecured Eurobonds with a 5-year tenor at a coupon of 0.875% in May 2021 under this program.\nAll of these issuances are guaranteed by Ryanair Holdings. The Company used the proceeds from these issuances for\ngeneral corporate purposes.\nIn May 2019, Ryanair DAC entered into a €0.75bn general corporate purposes unsecured term loan facility, with\na syndicate of 10 banks. The facility had 5-year tenor. In May 2023, the loan was refinanced with an unsecured €0.75bn\nsyndicated revolving credit facility (at a lower margin) maturing in May 2028. €0.49bn was drawn under this facility at\nMarch 31, 2024.\n57\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe table below sets forth the contractual obligations and commercial commitments of the Company with\ndefinitive payment terms, which will require significant cash outlays in the future, as of March 31, 2024. These\nobligations primarily relate to Ryanair’s aircraft purchase and related financing obligations, which are described in more\ndetail above. For additional information on the Company’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments, see\nNote 22 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 18.\nThe amounts listed under “Purchase Obligations” in the table reflect future obligations for firm aircraft\npurchases under the existing 2014 Boeing Contract and 2023 Boeing Contract. This table is calculated by multiplying\nthe number of firm aircraft the Group is obligated to purchase under its agreements with Boeing during the relevant\nperiod by the standard list price (at the time of announcing the transactions) of approximately U.S. $102.5m for each\nBoeing 737-8200 aircraft and U.S.$135m for each Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft, adjusted for (i) basic credits\n(approximately 60% of the standard list price); (ii) price escalation over the original scheduled delivery timeframe; and\n(iii) advance payments paid in prior fiscal years. The dollar-denominated obligations are converted into euro at the year-\nend exchange rate of U.S. $1.0793 = €1.00. The Group is eligible for further customer specific credits, reflective, inter\nalia, of its longstanding partnership with Boeing, its launch customer status for the Boeing 737-8200 aircraft, its\ncommitment to purchase 210 Boeing 737-8200 aircraft under the 2014 Boeing Contract and the Group’s largest ever\nsingle order of up to 300 Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft (including 150 firm orders and 150 options) under the 2023 Boeing\nContract and the delayed commencement of Boeing 737-8200 aircraft deliveries. These customer specific credits are\nnot included in the table below but will reduce the average amount payable per aircraft, and therefore, the Group’s\nobligations due under the 2014 Boeing Contract and 2023 Boeing Contract. The Group considers that Boeing customer\nspecific credits are not material to the Group’s cash outflows over the time horizon of the 2014 Boeing Contract or the\ntime horizon of the 2023 Boeing Contract. Under the terms of the 2014 Boeing Contract and 2023 Boeing Contract, the\nGroup is required to make periodic advance payments of the purchase price for aircraft it has agreed to purchase over\nthe two-year period preceding the scheduled delivery of aircraft with the balance of the purchase price being due at the\ntime of delivery. Purchase Obligations detailed below are based on an agreed delivery schedule as of March 31, 2024.\nThe amounts listed under “Operating Lease Obligations” reflect the Company’s obligations under its aircraft\noperating lease arrangements at March 31, 2024.\nObligat io n s Due by P er io d\nContractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-2 years 2-5 years After 5 years\n€M €M €M €M €M\nDebt (a) 2,582 50 843 1,689 —\nPurchase Obligations (b) 11,653 2,162 186 3,889 5,416\nOperating Lease Obligations 184 46 37 101 —\nFuture Interest Payments (c) 169 56 56 57 —\nTotal Contractual Obligations 14,588 2,314 1,122 5,736 5,416\n(a) For additional information on Ryanair’s debt obligations, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 18.\n(b) This reflects the 64 firm aircraft ordered under the 2014 Boeing Contract (146 already delivered by the end of fiscal year 2024) assuming\ndelivery of 64 in fiscal year 2025. Also reflected are the 150 firm aircraft ordered under the 2023 Boeing Contract to be delivered over a\n7-year period from calendar 2027 to 2033 (inclusive). For additional information on the Company’s purchase obligation, see Note 22 to\nthe consolidated financial statements included in Item 18.\n(c) In determining an appropriate methodology to estimate future interest payments, the Company has applied either the applicable fixed\nrate or currently applicable variable rate where appropriate. These interest rates are subject to change and amounts actually due may\nbe higher or lower than noted in the table above.\n58\nTREND INFORMATION\nFor information concerning the principal trends and uncertainties affecting the Company’s results of operations\nand financial condition, see “Item 3. Key Information—Risk Factors,” “Item 4. Information on the Company—Strategy—\nResponding to market challenges” and “Item 5.

Details of these arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material\neffect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources are discussed below.\nGuarantees.

This amount\nexcludes guarantees given in relation to the 2014 Boeing Contract and 2023 Boeing Contract under which there was a\ntotal of 64 firm Boeing 737-8200s and 150 firm Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft yet to be delivered as at March 31, 2024\namounting to approximately U.S.$11bn at the standard list price of U.S.$102.5m and U.S.$135m respectively (net of\nbasic credits and reflective of price escalation over the originally scheduled delivery timeframe).\n59\nItem 6.

All members of the Audit Committee are independent for the purposes of the listing rules of the\nNASDAQ and the U.S. federal securities laws.\n(b) Executive Committee. The Board of Directors established the Executive Committee in August 1996. The\nExecutive Committee can exercise the powers exercisable by the full Board of Directors in circumstances in which action\nby the Board of Directors is required but it is impracticable to convene a meeting of the full Board of Directors. Mr. Millar\n(Chair), Ms. Brennan, Mr. McCarthy and Mr. O’Leary are members of the Executive Committee.\n(c) Nomination Committee. The Board of Directors established the Nomination Committee in May 1999 to\nmake recommendations and proposals to the full Board of Directors concerning the selection of individuals to serve as\nExecutive and Non-Executive Directors. The Board of Directors as a whole then makes appropriate determinations\nregarding such matters after considering such recommendations and proposals. Mr. McCarthy (Chair), Ms. Köstinger,\nMs. Laghrari Laabi (from July 1, 2024), Mr. Millar and Ms. Nolan are the members of the Nomination Committee.\n(d) Remuneration Committee.

The Board of Directors established the Safety and Security Committee in\nMarch 1997 to review and discuss air safety and security performance. The Safety and Security Committee reports to\nthe full Board of Directors each quarter. The Safety and Security Committee is composed of Mr. O’Brien, Mr. Brennan\nand Ms. Carol Sharkey (who Co-Chairs the committee with Mr. O’Brien). Other attendees include the Accountable\nManagers of each of the Ryanair Group Airlines and various nominated persons who are invited to attend, as required,\nfrom time to time. Each airline has a separate Safety & Security Committee to comply with their local regulators’\nrequirements.\nPowers of, and Action by, the Board of Directors\nThe Board of Directors is empowered by the Articles of Association of Ryanair Holdings (the “Articles”) to carry\non the business of Ryanair Holdings, subject to the Articles, provisions of general law and the right of shareholders to\ngive directions to the Directors by way of ordinary resolutions. Every Director who is present at a meeting of the Board\nof Directors of Ryanair Holdings has one vote. In the case of a tie on a vote, the chairman of the Board of Directors has\na second or tie-breaking vote. A Director may designate an alternate Director to attend any Board of Directors meeting,\nand such alternate Director shall have all the rights of a Director at such meeting.\n62\nThe quorum for a meeting of the Board of Directors, unless another number is fixed by the Directors, consists\nof three Directors, a majority of whom must be EU nationals. The Articles require the vote of a majority of the Directors\n(or alternates) present at a duly convened meeting for the approval of any action by the Board of Directors.\nComposition and Term of Office\nThe Articles provide that the Board of Directors shall consist of no fewer than 3 and no more than 15 Directors,\nunless otherwise determined by the shareholders. There is no maximum age for a Director and no Director is required\nto own any shares of Ryanair Holdings.\nDirectors are elected (or have their appointments confirmed) at the annual general meetings of shareholders.\nExemptions from NASDAQ Corporate Governance Rules\nThe Company relies on certain exemptions from the NASDAQ corporate governance rules. These exemptions,\nand the practices the Company adheres to, are as follows:\n• The Company is exempt from NASDAQ’s quorum requirements applicable to meetings of shareholders,\nwhich require a minimum quorum of 33 1/3% for any meeting of the holders of common stock, which in the\nCompany’s case are its Ordinary Shares. In keeping with Irish generally accepted business practice, the\nArticles provide for a quorum for general meetings of shareholders of two shareholders, regardless of the\nlevel of their aggregate share ownership.\n• The Company is exempt from NASDAQ’s requirement with respect to Audit Committee approval of related\nparty transactions, as well as its requirement that shareholders approve certain stock or asset purchases\nwhen a Director, officer or substantial shareholder has an interest. The Company is subject to extensive\nprovisions under the Listing Rules of Euronext Dublin governing transactions with related parties, as defined\ntherein, and the Irish Companies Act also restricts the extent to which Irish companies may enter into related\nparty transactions. In addition, the Articles contain provisions regarding disclosure of interests by the\nDirectors and restrictions on their votes in circumstances involving conflicts of interest. The concept of a\nrelated party for purposes of NASDAQ’s Audit Committee and shareholder approval rules differs in certain\nrespects from the definition of a transaction with a related party under the Irish Listing Rules and the Irish\nCompanies Act.\n• NASDAQ requires shareholder approval for certain transactions involving the sale or issuance by a listed\ncompany of common stock other than in a public offering and when a plan or other equity compensation\narrangement is established or materially amended. Under the NASDAQ rules, whether shareholder approval\nis required for transactions other than public offerings depends, among other things, on the number of\nshares to be issued or sold in connection with a transaction, while the Irish Listing Rules require shareholder\napproval when the value of a transaction, as measured under any one or more of four class tests, exceeds\na certain percentage of the size of the listed company undertaking the transaction as measured for the\npurposes of same tests. The Irish Listing Rules also require shareholder approval of equity compensation\narrangements but, subject to certain exceptions, if provided by the plan, permit amendments to the plan by\na board committee without further shareholder approval.\n• NASDAQ requires that each issuer solicit proxies and provide proxy statements for all meetings of\nshareholders and provide copies of such proxy solicitation to NASDAQ. The Company is exempt from this\nrequirement as the solicitation of holders of ADRs is not required under the Irish Listing Rules or the Irish\nCompanies Act. However, it has been Ryanair’s policy to solicit holders of ADRs, and it will do so again once\nthe restriction on non-EU shareholders voting rights because of Brexit has been removed. For additional\n63\ninformation, please see “Item 3 Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks Related to Ownership of the\nCompany’s Ordinary Shares or ADRs”. Details of Ryanair’s annual general meetings and other shareholder\nmeetings, together with the requirements for admission, voting or the appointment of a proxy are available\non the website of the Company in accordance with the Irish Companies Act, the Company’s Articles of\nAssociation and the Irish Listing Rules.\nThe Company also follows certain other practices under the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Irish\nCorporate Governance Annex in lieu of those set forth in the NASDAQ corporate governance rules, as expressly\npermitted thereby.\nMost significantly:\nIndependence. NASDAQ requires that a majority of an issuer’s Board of Directors be “independent” under the\nstandards set forth in the NASDAQ rules and that Directors deemed independent be identified in the Company’s Annual\nReport on Form 20-F. The Board of Directors has determined that each of the Company’s thirteen serving Non-Executive\nDirectors is “independent” under the standards set forth in the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Irish Corporate\nGovernance Annex (the “Code”).\nUnder the Code, there is no bright-line test establishing set criteria for independence, as there is under NASDAQ\nRule 5605(a)(12). Instead, the Board of Directors determines whether the Director is independent, and whether there are\nrelationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the Director’s judgment. Under the\nCode, the Board of Directors may determine that a Director is independent notwithstanding the existence of relationships\nor circumstances which may appear relevant to its determination, but it should state its reasons if it makes such a\ndetermination. The Code specifies that relationships or circumstances that may be relevant include whether the Director:\n(i) is or has been an employee of the relevant company or group within the last five years; (ii) has, or has had within the\nlast three years a direct or indirect material business relationship with such company; (iii) has received or receives\npayments from such company, subject to certain exceptions; (iv) has close family ties with any of the Company’s\nadvisers, Directors or senior employees; (v) holds cross-Directorships or other significant links with other Directors; (vi)\nrepresents a significant shareholder; or (vii) has served on the Board of Directors for more than nine years.\nIn determining that each of the thirteen serving Non-Executive Directors is independent under the Code standard,\nthe Ryanair Holdings Board of Directors identified such relevant factors with respect to Non-Executive Directors Messrs.\nMillar and O’Brien.\nThe Board considered Mr. Millar’s independence given that he was Ryanair’s Deputy CEO up to December 31,\n2014, and CFO up to September 30, 2014. The Board has considered his employment and has concluded that Mr. Millar\nis an independent Non-Executive Director within the spirit and meaning of the Code.\nThe Board considered Mr. O’Brien’s independence given that he served as Chief Pilot and Flight Operations\nManager of Ryanair from 1987 to 1991. The Board has considered Mr. O’Brien’s employment and has concluded that he\nis an independent Non-Executive Director within the spirit and meaning of the Code.\nThe Board considered that each of these Directors is independent in character and judgment as they either have\nother significant commercial and professional commitments and/or bring their own level of senior experience gained in\ntheir fields of international business and professional practice.\nThe NASDAQ independence criteria specifically state that an individual may not be considered independent if,\nwithin the last three years, such individual or a member of his or her immediate family has had certain specified\nrelationships with the Company, its parent, any consolidated subsidiary, its internal or external auditors, or any company\n64\nthat has significant business relationships with the Company, its parent or any consolidated subsidiary. Neither\nownership of a significant amount of stock nor length of service on the Board is a per se bar to independence under the\nNASDAQ rules.\nSENIOR MANAGEMENT\nThe following table sets forth certain information concerning the Senior Management of the Ryanair Group:\nName Age Position\nMichael O’Leary 63 Group CEO\nNeil Sorahan 52 Group CFO\nJuliusz Komorek 46 Group CLO; Co.

This contract extended the vesting period for the 10m share options granted in\nFebruary 2019, which are exercisable at a strike price of €11.12, but only if the Ryanair Group PAT exceeds €2.2bn (up\nfrom a prior €2.0bn target) in any year up to fiscal year 2028 (inclusive) and/or the share price of the Company exceeds\n€21 for a period of 28 days between April 1, 2021 and March 31, 2028. If these targets are not achieved, these share\n66\noptions will lapse and MOL will receive nothing other than his basic salary and annual bonus. A final vesting condition\nis that these options will lapse should MOL leave the Ryanair Group’s employment on/before the end of July 2028.\nSTAFF AND LABOR RELATIONS\nThe following table sets forth the details of Ryanair’s team (including all Group airlines) at each of March 31,\n2024, 2023 and 2022:\nNum ber of Staff at Ma rch 31,\nClassification 2024 2023 2022\nManagement 124 125 116\nAdministrative/IT Labs 1,552 1,028 828\nMaintenance 652 506 483\nGround Operations 794 655 488\nPilots 7,049 6,582 5,860\nCabin Crew 16,905 13,365 11,341\nTotal 27,076 22,261 19,116\nRyanair Group airlines have concluded Collective Labor Agreements (“CLAs”) with trade unions in most of their\nmajor markets. Ryanair will continue to defend its existing high productivity business model. Ryanair believes that\nexisting terms and conditions for both pilots and cabin crew are industry leading among European low cost operators\nwith competitive pay, advantageous fixed rosters, outstanding promotional opportunities, and a wide choice of base\nlocations across Europe.\nEuropean regulations require pilots to be licensed as commercial pilots with specific ratings for each aircraft\ntype flown. In addition, European regulations require all commercial pilots to be medically certified as physically fit.\nLicenses and medical certification are subject to periodic re-evaluation and require recurrent training and recent flying\nexperience in order to be maintained. Maintenance engineers must be licensed and qualified for specific aircraft types.\nCabin crew must undergo initial and periodic competency training. Training programs are subject to approval and\nmonitoring by the competent authority. In addition, the appointment of senior management personnel directly involved\nin the supervision of flight operations, training, maintenance, and aircraft inspection must be satisfactory to the\ncompetent authority. Based on its experience in managing the airline’s growth to date, management believes that there\nis a sufficient pool of qualified and licensed pilots, engineers, and mechanics within the EU and the U.K, supplemented\nthrough traineeships, to satisfy Ryanair’s anticipated future needs in the areas of flight operations, maintenance and\nquality control. Ryanair has also been able to supplement its pool of pilots and cabin crew through the limited use of\ncontract agencies. These contract pilots and cabin crew are included in the table above.\nRyanair’s crew earn productivity-based incentive payments, including a sales bonus for onboard sales for flight\nattendants and payments based on the number of hours or sectors flown by pilots and cabin crew (within limits set by\nregulations governing maximum working hours.) Ryanair’s pilots and cabin crew are currently subject to EASA-approved\nlimits of 900 flight-hours per calendar year.\nIf more stringent regulations on flight-hours were to be adopted, Ryanair’s flight personnel could experience a\nreduction in their total pay due to lower compensation for the number of hours or sectors flown and Ryanair could be\nrequired to hire additional flight personnel.\nRyanair Holdings’ shareholders have approved a number of share-based remuneration plans for employees and\nDirectors including Share Option Plan 2013 and LTIP 2019 (which replaced Option Plan 2013 for share based\nremuneration granted after the 2019 AGM). Ryanair Holdings has granted share-based remuneration to several of its\n67\nsenior managers. For details of all outstanding share options, see “Item 10. Additional Information — Options to\nPurchase Securities from Registrant or Subsidiaries.”\nCOMPENSATION RECOVERY\nNot applicable.\nItem 7.

Financial Information\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPlease refer to “Item 18. Financial Statements.”\nOTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business. Although no assurance can\nbe given as to the outcome of any current or pending litigation, management does not believe that any such litigation\nwill, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition of\nthe Company, except as described below.\nEU State Aid-Related Proceedings. Since 2002, the European Commission has examined the agreements\nbetween Ryanair and various airports to establish whether they constituted illegal state aid. In many cases, the European\nCommission has concluded that the agreements did not constitute state aid. In other cases, Ryanair has successfully\nchallenged the European Commission findings that there was state aid. In 2014, the European Commission announced\nfindings of state aid to Ryanair in its arrangements with Pau, Nimes, Angouleme, Altenburg and Zweibrücken airports,\nordering Ryanair to repay a total of approximately €10m of alleged aid. In 2016, the European Commission announced\nfindings of state aid to Ryanair in its arrangements with Cagliari and Klagenfurt, ordering Ryanair to repay approximately\n€13m of alleged aid. Ryanair appealed these “aid” decisions to the EU General Court. In 2018, the EU General Court\nupheld the European Commission’s findings regarding Ryanair’s arrangements with Pau, Nimes, Angouleme and\nAltenburg airports, and overturned the European Commission’s finding regarding Ryanair’s arrangement with\nZweibrücken airport. Ryanair appealed the negative rulings to the Court of Justice of the EU, but in December 2019\nRyanair discontinued the appeals as the Court had refused to grant an oral hearing in any of the cases. The appeal before\nthe General Court regarding Ryanair’s arrangements with Cagliari airport has been discontinued following the European\nCommission’s withdrawal of its decision in March 2023 as a result of a General Court ruling in a related case. In 2021,\nthe General Court upheld the European Commission’s finding regarding Ryanair’s arrangements with Klagenfurt airport.\nRyanair appealed this negative finding to the Court of Justice of the EU and received a ruling in November 2023 where\nthe European Commission’s finding was upheld. In August 2019, the European Commission announced findings of state\naid to Ryanair in its arrangements with Montpellier airport, ordering Ryanair to repay a total of approximately €9m of\nalleged aid. Ryanair appealed the Montpellier “aid” decision to the General Court and received a judgment in June 2023\nupholding the European Commission’s finding. Ryanair appealed the General Court judgment to the European Court of\nJustice in August 2023. In July 2022, the European Commission announced a finding of state aid to Ryanair in its\narrangements at La Rochelle airport, ordering Ryanair to repay approximately €8m of alleged aid. Ryanair appealed the\nLa Rochelle “aid” decision to the General Court in November 2023.\nRyanair is facing similar legal challenges with respect to agreements with certain other airports, notably\nCarcassonne, Girona, Reus, Târgu Mureș, Beziers and Frankfurt (Hahn). These investigations are ongoing (as is the\nEuropean Commission’s re-examination of the Cagliari case following its withdrawal in March 2023 of the 2016 “aid”\ndecision) and Ryanair currently expects that they will conclude in 2024-25, with any European Commission decisions\nappealable to the EU General Court.\nRyanair is also facing an allegation that it has benefited from unlawful state aid in a German court case in\nrelation to its arrangements with Frankfurt (Hahn) launched by Lufthansa in 2006.\n69\nAdverse rulings in the above or similar cases could be used as precedents by competitors to challenge Ryanair’s\nagreements with other publicly-owned airports and could cause Ryanair to strongly reconsider its growth strategy in\nrelation to public or state-owned airports across Europe. This could in turn lead to a scaling back of Ryanair’s growth\nstrategy due to the smaller number of privately owned airports available for development. No assurance can be given\nas to the outcome of these proceedings, nor as to whether any unfavorable outcomes may, individually or in the\naggregate, have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the Company.\nLegal Proceedings Against Internet Ticket Touts. The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings\nagainst internet ticket touts (“screenscraper websites”) in Germany, Ireland, France, Italy, and the U.S. Screenscraper\nwebsites gain unauthorized access to Ryanair’s website and booking system, extract flight and pricing information and\ndisplay it on their own websites for sale to customers at prices which include intermediary mark-ups on top of Ryanair’s\nfares. Ryanair does not allow any such commercial use of its website and objects to the practice of screenscraping also\non the basis of certain legal principles, such as contractual and database rights, copyright protection, etc. The\nCompany’s objective is to prevent any unauthorized use of its website and to prevent consumer harm, and the resultant\nreputational damage to the Company, that may arise due to the failure by some operators of screenscraper websites to\nprovide Ryanair with the passengers’ genuine contact and payment method details. The Company also believes that the\nselling of airline tickets by screenscraper websites is inherently anti-consumer as it inflates the cost of air travel. At the\nsame time, Ryanair encourages genuine price comparison websites which allow consumers to compare prices of\nseveral airlines and then refer consumers to the airline website in order to perform the booking at the original fare.\nRyanair offers licensed access to its flight and pricing information to such websites. Ryanair also permits GDSs to\nprovide access to Ryanair’s fares to traditional bricks and mortar travel agencies and closed corporate travel booking\nplatforms. In addition, Ryanair offers Direct Distribution Agreements (DDAs) to online travel agents (OTAs). DDAs align\nwith Ryanair’s exclusive online distribution model while allowing OTAs access to Ryanair’s price, flight, timetable and\nancillary data for the purpose of display only on the OTA websites. The passenger can purchase accurately priced\nRyanair flights and ancillary products and is brought to log in to their MyRyanair account and confirm their purchase on\nRyanair.com. The Company has received favorable rulings in France, Germany, Czechia, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands\nand the U.S., and unfavorable rulings in Germany, Czechia, Spain, France, Switzerland, the UK and Italy. Following a\npositive decision in Ireland in November 2023, whereby the Irish High Court found that Flightbox, a screen scraper, was\nbound by the Terms of Use of the Ryanair website and, as such, granted Ryanair a permanent injunction prohibiting\nFlightbox from breaching the binding Terms of Use of the Ryanair website, Ryanair was approached by a number of\nOTAs, including On The Beach (OTB) and Kiwi with whom Ryanair have been in litigation with for several years. OTB and\nKiwi both signed DDAs which culminated in the cessation of all extant legal proceedings between the parties. However,\npending the outcome of the legal proceedings that remain ongoing or which may be initiated in the future, or of\ncompetition authority investigations (such as the one launched by the Italian AGCM in September 2023, outlined in “Item\n4. Information on the Company—GOVERNMENT REGULATION—Regulation of competition.”), and if Ryanair were to be\nultimately unsuccessful in any of them, the activities of screenscraper websites could lead to a reduction in the number\nof customers who book directly on Ryanair’s website and loss of ancillary revenues which are an important source of\nprofitability through the sale of car hire, hotels, travel insurance, etc. Also, some business may be lost to the Company\nonce potential customers are presented by a screenscraper website with a Ryanair fare or a fee for an ancillary product\nsuch as checked baggage or priority boarding inflated by the screenscraper’s intermediary fee. See “Item 3. Key\nInformation—Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Company—The Company Faces Risks Related to Unauthorized Use of\nInformation from the Company’s Website”.\nU.S. Litigation. In November 2018, a putative securities class action complaint was filed against the Company\nand Mr. O’Leary in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “District Court”). The District\nCourt appointed lead plaintiffs, the City of Birmingham Retirement and Relief System and City of Birmingham Firemen’s\nand Policemen’s Supplemental Pension System (the “Birmingham Funds”), in January 2019. The Birmingham Funds\nfiled an amended complaint in April 2019 that purported to be on behalf of purchasers of Ryanair American Depositary\nShares (“ADSs”) between May 30, 2017 and September 28, 2018. The amended complaint alleged, among other things,\n70\nthat in filings with the SEC, investor calls, interviews, and other communications, the Company and/or Mr. O’Leary made\nmaterially false and misleading statements and omissions regarding employment and financial data, employee\nnegotiation processes, the September 2017 pilot rostering management issue, and the likelihood and financial impact\nof unionization, which allegedly artificially inflated the market value of the Company’s securities. In June 2020, the\nDistrict Court issued a ruling dismissing in part the Birmingham Funds’ claims, including claims regarding employment\nand financial data, employee negotiation processes, the September 2017 pilot rostering management issue, and the\nfinancial impact of unionization. The Birmingham Funds’ claims regarding the likelihood of unionization were not\ndismissed. In March 2021, the Birmingham Funds issued a motion to amend their claim, seeking, among other things,\nto re-introduce prior dismissed claims. The Company and Mr. O’Leary filed an opposition to the motion to amend in May\n2021. The motion was refused in March 2022. In March 2023, following mediation, the parties agreed to settle the case.\nThe total settlement amount was U.S.$5m, which is considerably less than the legal costs that would have been incurred\nhad this action gone all the way to trial. The Company’s position remains that there was no lawful basis for this claim,\nbut that the settlement will enable it to avoid the further costs and distraction of ongoing litigation, and it is therefore in\nthe interest of all of the Company’s shareholders to agree to this very modest settlement. The final settlement agreement\nwas approved by the Court in October 2023. The case is now closed.\nConsumer Law Proceedings. In mid-2023, the Spanish Ministry of Consumer Affairs launched sanctioning\nproceedings against Ryanair and several other airlines regarding cabin baggage and other customer policies. The\nCompany filed submissions with the Ministry explaining that its policies are fair, necessary for operational and safety\npurposes, and fully transparent. In May 2024, the Ministry ordered the discontinuation of these policies and imposed\nsubstantial fines on Ryanair and other airlines (a cumulative total of approx. €150 million). These decisions are subject\nto review by the Minister of Consumer Affairs, which is expected to conclude between June and September 2024, with\nany final decisions appealable to courts. Ryanair intends to fully defend its position with reference to its rights under\nSpanish and EU law, as well as positive court rulings in similar matters, but the outcome of these proceedings cannot\nbe guaranteed.\nDividend Policy\nFrom fiscal year 2025 onwards, under the Group’s new dividend policy, Ryanair plans to return approximately\n25% of prior-year Profit After Tax (adjusted for non-recurring gains or losses) by way of ordinary dividend to our\nshareholders. A maiden ordinary dividend of €0.175 per share was paid in February 2024 and a final dividend of €0.178\nper share was declared (payable after 2024 AGM approval). Additionally, the Board, taking into account prevailing market\nconditions and ensuring that the Group retains a prudent level of cash to fund debt and capex requirements will retain\nthe flexibility to consider, when or if appropriate, the return of surplus cash to shareholders through special distributions\n(including dividends and/or share buybacks).\nShare Buyback Program\nFollowing shareholder approval at the 2006 AGM, a €300m share buyback program was formally announced on\nJune 5, 2007. Permission was received at the annual general meeting held on September 20, 2007 to repurchase a\nmaximum of 75.6m Ordinary Shares representing 5% of the Company’s then outstanding share capital. The €300m share\nbuyback of approximately 59.5m Ordinary Shares, representing approximately 3.8% of the Company’s pre-existing share\ncapital, was completed in November 2007. In February 2008, the Company announced a second share buyback program\nof up to €200m worth of Ordinary Shares, which was ratified by shareholders at the annual general meeting held on\nSeptember 18, 2008. 18.1m Ordinary Shares were repurchased under this program at a cost of approximately €46m.\nThe Company also completed share buybacks of €125m in respect of 36.5m Ordinary Shares in fiscal year 2012 and\n15m Ordinary Shares at a cost of approximately €68m in fiscal year 2013.\n71\nIn April 2012, the Company held an EGM to authorize the Directors to repurchase Ordinary Shares and ADRs for\nup to 5% of the issued share capital of the Company traded on the NASDAQ. Up until April 2012, shareholders had only\nauthorized the Directors to repurchase Ordinary Shares. As the ADRs typically trade at a premium compared to Ordinary\nShares, this has resulted in increased costs in performing share buybacks and may continue to do so in the future. This\nauthority was renewed at the Annual General Meeting held on September 20, 2013 and at subsequent Annual General\nMeetings and an Extraordinary General Meeting in 2016.\nIn fiscal year 2014, 69.5m Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares underlying just over 6m ADRs) were\nrepurchased at a cost of approximately €482m. In February 2015, the Company announced a €400m ordinary share\nbuyback program which was completed between February and August 2015. In February 2016, the Company announced\nan €800m Ordinary Share buyback program (including Ordinary Shares underlying ADRs) and this program was\nsubsequently increased to €886m in June 2016. €418m of this program was completed in fiscal year 2016 to buyback\napproximately 29.1m shares (including approximately 19.9m shares underlying ADRs) with the remaining €468m spent\nin fiscal year 2017 to buyback approximately 36m shares (including approximately 3.9m shares underlying ADRs). In\naddition to the above, in fiscal year 2017, the Company bought back 36.4m shares (including approximately 17.7m\nshares underlying ADRs) at a total cost of approximately €550m during the period November 2016 to February 2017. In\nFebruary 2017, the Company announced the commencement of a €150m share buyback program in respect of shares\nunderlying ADRs. The Company bought back approximately 2m shares underlying ADRs at a cost of €39m under this\nprogram during fiscal year 2018. In addition to the above, in fiscal year 2018, the Company bought back 33m shares at\na total cost of €600m under its €600m share buyback program which commenced in May 2017 and 11.7m shares at a\ntotal cost of €190m under its €750m share buyback which commenced in February 2018. In fiscal year 2019, the\nCompany bought back 37.8m shares at a total cost of approximately €561m under its €750m share buyback which\ncommenced in February 2018. In fiscal year 2020, the Company bought back approximately 47.2m shares (including\n15.8m shares underlying ADRs) at a cost of €581m under its €700m share buyback program (including Ordinary Shares\nunderlying ADRs) which was announced and commenced in May 2019. This share buyback program was terminated in\nMarch 2020 as part of a series of measures introduced to preserve cash during the Covid-19 crisis.\nThere were no share repurchases in fiscal year 2024, 2023 or 2022. In May 2024 (fiscal year 2025), the Company\nannounced and launched a €700m share buyback program (including Ordinary Shares underlying ADRs).\nSee “Item 9. The Offer and Listing—Trading Markets” below for further information regarding share buybacks.\nSIGNIFICANT CHANGES\nIn May 2024, the Company announced and launched a €700m share buyback program (including Ordinary\nShares underlying ADRs).\nItem 9. The Offer and Listing\nTRADING MARKETS\nThe primary market for Ryanair Holdings’ Ordinary Shares is Euronext Dublin. In December 2021, Ryanair\nHoldings delisted from the London Stock Exchange as the volume of trading on the London Stock Exchange did not\njustify the costs related to such listing. The Ordinary Shares were first listed for trading on the Official List of Euronext\nDublin in June 1997 and were first admitted to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange in July 1998.\nADRs, each representing 5 Ordinary Shares, are traded on NASDAQ. The Bank of New York Mellon is Ryanair\nHoldings’ depositary for purposes of issuing ADRs evidencing the ADSs.\n72\nRyanair Holdings’ shares trade under the following stock symbols:\nEuronext Dublin RY4C\nNASDAQ RYAAY\nSince certain of the Ordinary Shares are held by brokers or other nominees, the number of direct record holders\nin the United States, which is reported as 53, may not be fully indicative of the number of direct beneficial owners in the\nUnited States, or of where the direct beneficial owners of such shares are resident.\nIn order to increase the percentage of its share capital held by EU nationals, beginning June 26, 2001, Ryanair\nHoldings instructed the Depositary to suspend the issuance of new ADRs in exchange for the deposit of Ordinary Shares\nuntil further notice. Therefore, holders of Ordinary Shares cannot currently convert their Ordinary Shares into ADRs. The\nDepositary will however convert existing ADRs into Ordinary Shares at the request of the holders of such ADRs. The\nCompany in 2002 implemented additional measures to restrict the ability of non-EU nationals to purchase Ordinary\nShares. As a result, non-EU nationals are currently effectively barred from purchasing Ordinary Shares. See “Item 10.\nAdditional Information—Limitations on Share Ownership by Non-EU Nationals” for additional information.\nThe Company, at its AGM and EGM of the Shareholders, has, in recent years, passed a special resolution\npermitting the Company to engage in Ordinary Share buyback programs subject to certain limits noted above. Since\nJune 2007 (when the Company engaged in its first Ordinary Share buyback program) the Company has repurchased the\nfollowing Ordinary Shares:\nYear ended March 31, No. of shares (m) Approx. cost (€m)\n2008-2021 407.7 4,525.9\n2022 — —\n2023 — —\n2024 — —\nPeriod through June 24, 2024 11.3 226.4\nTotal 419.0 4,752.3\nAt an EGM of Shareholders held on April 19, 2012, the Company obtained a new repurchase authority which\nenables the Company to repurchase the Company’s ADRs which are traded on NASDAQ. Any ADRs purchased are\nconverted to Ordinary Shares by the Company’s brokers for subsequent repurchase and cancellation by the Company.\nAs of March 31, 2024, the total number of options over Ordinary Shares outstanding under the Company’s Option\nPlan 2013 was 16.6m, representing approximately 1.5% of the Company’s issued share capital at that date. As of March\n31, 2024, the total number of conditional share awards outstanding under the Company’s LTIP 2019 was 2.4m,\nrepresenting approximately 0.2% of the Company’s issued share capital at that date. 16m options and all conditional\nshares referred to above had not yet vested at March 31, 2024.\nItem 10. Additional Information\nDESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK\nRyanair Holdings’ capital stock consists of Ordinary Shares, each having a par value of 0.600 euro cent. As of\nMarch 31, 2024, a total of 1,140,045,528 Ordinary Shares were outstanding.\n73\nOn February 26, 2007, Ryanair effected a 2-for-1 share split as a result of which each of its then existing Ordinary\nShares, with a par value of 1.27 euro cent, was split into two new Ordinary Shares, with a par value of 0.635 euro. On\nOctober 27, 2015, the Company completed a capital reorganization which involved the consolidation of its ordinary share\ncapital on a 39 for 40 basis which resulted in the reduction of ordinary shares in issue by 33.8m ordinary shares to\n1,319.3m as at that date. The par value of an ordinary share was also reduced from 0.635 euro cent each to 0.600 euro\neach under the reorganization. All ‘B’ Shares and Deferred Shares issued in connection with the B scheme were either\nredeemed or cancelled during fiscal year 2016 such that there were no ‘B’ Shares or Deferred Shares remaining in issue\nas at March 31, 2016. Each Ordinary Share entitles the holder thereof to one vote in respect of any matter voted upon by\nRyanair Holdings’ shareholders subject to limitations described under Item 10. Additional Information”—Limitations on\nShare Ownership by Non-EU Nationals”.\nOPTIONS TO PURCHASE SECURITIES FROM REGISTRANT OR SUBSIDIARIES\nDuring fiscal year 2014, Ryanair Holdings’ shareholders approved a stock option plan at the Company’s 2013\nAGM (referred to herein as “Option Plan 2013”), under which all employees and Directors were eligible to receive options.\nGrants of options were permitted to take place at the close of any of the ten years beginning with fiscal year 2014 (Option\nPlan 2013 was replaced by LTIP 2019 following shareholder approval at the 2019 AGM – see details below). Options\nare subject to at least a 5-year performance period. Under the rules of Option Plan 2013, no option is capable of being\nexercised after the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. The Remuneration Committee (“Remco”) has discretion to\ndetermine the financial performance targets that must be met with respect to the financial year. Those targets relate\ndirectly to the achievement of certain year-on-year growth targets in the Company’s profit after tax (“PAT”) figures for\neach of the financial years of the performance period and/or certain share price targets.\nUnder Option Plan 2013, during the fiscal year 2017, 34 managers (excluding the Executive Officers) were\ngranted 3m share options, in aggregate, at a strike price of €12.00. These options were subject to certain targets in\nrelation to PAT and/or share price and vested in March 2023. Almost 0.2m of these options were outstanding at March\n31, 2024 and must be fully exercised on/before August 25, 2024. During fiscal year 2019, 102 managers and 5 existing\nNon-Executive Board Members (NEDs) were granted 10m share options, in aggregate (of which a cumulative 0.25m\nrelates to NEDs), at a strike price of €11.12. Approximately 3.7m of these options have lapsed. In fiscal year 2024, the\nvesting date and ambitious performance targets on approximately 5.9m of these options (excluding those granted to\nNEDs) were amended to align with the revised dates and targets agreed for Mr. O’Leary’s 10m share options grant below.\nIn December 2022 Mr. O’Leary agreed to the extension of his contract as Group CEO to July 2028 (previously July 2024).\nThis new contract extends the vesting period for the 10m share options granted to Mr. O’Leary in February 2019, which\nare exercisable at a strike price of €11.12, but only if the Ryanair Group PAT exceeds €2.2bn (up from a prior €2.0bn\ntarget) in any year up to financial year 2028 (inclusive) and/or the share price of the Company exceeds €21 for a period\nof 28 days between April 1, 2021 and March 31, 2028. The NED options referred to above have subsequently vested and\nare exercisable between September 30, 2024 and February 7, 2026.\nAt the 2019 AGM, shareholders approved a new Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP 2019”), which replaces Option\nPlan 2013 for all future grants. The implementation of LTIP 2019 followed a review by Remco (with the assistance of\nDeloitte) of the Company’s remuneration policy for senior employees and directors of the Company to ensure it\ncontinued to support the Company’s strategic objectives and aligned with external views on executive compensation.\nAwards to employees under LTIP 2019 are ordinarily in the form of performance-based shares (“conditional shares”)\nwith an upper limit on the market value of such conditional shares of 150% of base salary applicable in any year for an\nemployee or Executive Director of the Group, with the possibility of up to 200% of base salary if the Board determines\nthat exceptional circumstances exist. For flexibility, LTIP 2019 also includes the ability to make awards of share options,\nwith the expectation that any such awards will be on an infrequent basis and will be principally focused on a small\nnumber of the Group’s executive management team. NEDs are not eligible to receive share option or performance-based-\nshare awards under LTIP 2019. LTIP 2019 also contains provisions for the issue of conditional shares to facilitate the\n74\nrecruitment of senior management. In aggregate, in any ten-year period, the number of shares which may be in issue\nunder the LTIP 2019 (and Option Plan 2013) by the Company may not exceed 10% of the issued ordinary share capital\nof the Company from time to time. Remco has determined that Mr. O’Leary will not be eligible to participate in LTIP 2019\ngrants until after the vesting period for his 2019 share options grant has elapsed.\nThe aggregate of 16.6m Ordinary Shares that would be issuable upon exercise in full of the options that were\noutstanding as of March 31, 2024 under Option Plan 2013 represent approximately 1.5% of the issued share capital of\nRyanair Holdings as of such date. Of such total, options in respect of an aggregate of 10.4m Ordinary Shares were held\nby the Directors and Executive Officers of Ryanair Holdings. Only 0.6m of total options outstanding at March 31, 2024\nhad vested. For further information, see Notes 14 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements included herein.\nIn fiscal years 2022, 2023 and 2024 as a management retention tool, Remco granted conditional shares\n(approximately 2.4m in aggregate) under LTIP 2019 to over 80 managers (excluding the Group CEO and NEDs). The\nmarket value of such grants ranged between approximately 20% and 100% of base salary for participants (at the lower\nend of potential allocations). These conditional shares have a 3-year vesting period, with at least a 2-year hold period\nfor certain senior managers, and will only vest in their entirety if (i) ambitious cumulative Group traffic targets (50%\nweighting) are achieved over the 3-year vesting period; (ii) Ryanair’s Total Shareholder Return (30% weighting)\noutperforms a peer group including Air France/KLM, EasyJet, IAG, Southwest Airlines & Wizz over the 3-year vesting\nperiod; (iii) Ryanair’s CDP environmental protection score (20% weighting) improves from a “B“ rating to an “A-“ or better\nrating over the 3-year vesting period; (iv) participants sign a 12-month non-compete clause; and (v) participants continue\nto be employed by the Ryanair Group for a period of approximately 3 years from the date of grant. In fiscal year 2024, 11\nNEDs were granted 3,984 ordinary shares each under LTIP 2019. These grants are not subject to performance targets,\nvest at the end of May 2026 and further align NED interests with those of long-term Shareholders.\nThe Board of Directors may decide, at any time prior to the vesting of the LTIP awards, to impose further\nconditions on the awards and/or reduce the award (malus) or, in respect of awards to directors or executives, recover\nvalue from the participant following the vesting of an award (clawback). Further, the Board of Directors adopted an\nadditional clawback policy in accordance with the new NASDAQ clawback rules as approved by the Securities and\nExchange Commission, effective November 30, 2023. This policy has been acknowledged and accepted by Ryanair’s\nexecutive officers.\nARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION\nThe following is a summary of certain provisions of the Articles of Association of Ryanair Holdings. This\nsummary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Articles.\nObjects. Ryanair Holdings’ objects, which are detailed in its Articles, are broad and include carrying on business\nas an investment and holding company. Ryanair Holdings’ Irish company registration number is 249885.\nDirectors. Subject to certain exceptions, Directors may not vote on matters in which they have a material interest.\nThe ordinary remuneration of the Directors is determined from time to time by ordinary resolutions of the shareholders.\nAny Director who holds any executive office, serves on any committee or otherwise performs services, which, in the\nopinion of the Directors, are outside the scope of the ordinary duties of a Director, may be paid such extra remuneration\nas the Directors may determine. The Directors may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money. The\nDirectors are not required to retire at any particular age. There is no requirement for Directors to hold shares. The Articles\nof Association provide that one-third of the Directors (rounded down to the next whole number if it is a fractional number)\nretire and offer themselves for re-election at each annual general meeting of the Company. However, in compliance with\nthe requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code, all Directors retire and present themselves for re-election by\nthe shareholders annually. All of the shareholders entitled to attend and vote at the annual general meeting of the\nCompany may vote on the re-election of Directors.\n75\nGeneral Meetings. Annual and extraordinary general meetings are called upon 21 days’ advance notice. All\nRyanair shareholders who are entitled to attend, speak and vote at general meetings of the Company may appoint\nproxies electronically to attend, speak, ask questions and vote on behalf of them at general meetings. All holders of\nOrdinary Shares are entitled to attend, speak and vote at general meetings of the Company, subject to limitations\ndescribed under “—Limitations on the Right to Own Shares” and “Item 10. Additional Information—Limitations on Share\nOwnership by Non-EU Nationals”.\nRights, Preferences and Dividends Attaching to Shares. The Company has only three classes of shares, Ordinary\nShares with a par value of 0.600 euro cent per share, B Shares with a nominal value of 0.050 cent per share and Deferred\nShares with a nominal value of 0.050 cent per share. The B Shares and the Deferred Shares were created at an EGM of\nthe Company held on October 22, 2015 in connection with a return of value to shareholders arising from the sale of the\nCompany’s shareholding in Aer Lingus plc, and no such shares remain in issue. Accordingly, the Ordinary Shares\ncurrently represent the only class of shares in issue and rank equally with respect to payment of dividends and on any\nwinding-up of the Company. Any dividend, interest or other sum payable to a shareholder that remains unclaimed for\none year after having been declared may be invested by the Directors for the benefit of the Company until claimed. If the\nDirectors so resolve, any dividend which has remained unclaimed for 12 years from the date of its declaration shall be\nforfeited and cease to remain owing by the Company. The Company is permitted under its Articles to issue redeemable\nshares on such terms and in such manner as the Company may, by special resolution, determine. The Ordinary Shares\ncurrently in issue are not redeemable. The liability of shareholders to invest additional capital is limited to the amounts\nremaining unpaid on the shares held by them. There are no sinking fund provisions in the Articles of the Company.\nAction Necessary to Change the Rights of Shareholders. The rights attaching to shares in the Company may be\nvaried by special resolutions passed at meetings of the shareholders of the Company.\nLimitations on the Rights to Own Shares. The Articles contain detailed provisions enabling the Directors of the\nCompany to limit the number of shares in which non-EU nationals have an interest or the exercise by non-EU nationals\nof rights attaching to shares. See “—Limitations on Share Ownership by Non-EU Nationals” below. Such powers may be\nexercised by the Directors if they are of the view that any license, consent, permit or privilege of the Company or any of\nits subsidiaries that enables it to operate an air service may be refused, withheld, suspended or revoked or have\nconditions attached to it that inhibit its exercise and the exercise of the powers referred to above could prevent such an\noccurrence. The exercise of such powers could result in non-EU holders of shares being prevented from attending,\nspeaking or voting at general meetings of the Company and/or being required to dispose of shares held by them to EU\nnationals.\nDisclosure of Share Ownership. Under Irish law, the Company can require parties to disclose their interests in\nshares. The Articles of the Company provide that the Directors will not register any person as a holder of shares unless\nsuch person has completed a declaration indicating his/her nationality and the nature and extent of any interest which\nhe/she holds in Ordinary Shares. See, also “—Limitations on Share Ownership by non-EU nationals” below. Under Irish\nlaw, if a party acquires or disposes of Ordinary Shares so as to bring his interest above or below 3% of the total voting\nrights of the Company, and every whole percentage thereafter up to 100%, he must notify the Company and the Central\nBank of Ireland. The Company must disclose any notification it receives through the regulatory announcement service\nof Euronext Dublin.\n76\nOther Provisions of the Articles of Association. There are no provisions in the Articles:\n(i) delaying or prohibiting a change in the control of the Company, but which operate only with respect to a\nmerger, acquisition or corporate restructuring;\n(ii) discriminating against any existing or prospective holder of shares as a result of such shareholder owning\na substantial number of shares; or\n(iii) governing changes in capital,\nin each case, where such provisions are more stringent than those required by law.\nMATERIAL CONTRACTS\nIn September 2014, the Group entered into an agreement with The Boeing Company to purchase up to 200\nBoeing 737-8200 aircraft (100 firm orders and 100 aircraft subject to option), over a five-year period originally due to\ncommence in fiscal year 2020 (the “2014 Boeing Contract”). This agreement was approved by shareholders at an EGM\nof the Company on November 28, 2014. Subsequently, the Group agreed to purchase an additional 10 Boeing 737-8200\naircraft bringing the total number of Boeing 737-8200 aircraft on order to 210 (assuming all options are exercised). In\nApril 2018, the Company announced that it had converted 25 Boeing 737-8200 options into firm orders bringing the\nCompany’s firm order to 135 Boeing 737-8200s with a further 75 options remaining. In December 2020, Ryanair\nincreased its firm orders from 135 to 210 aircraft. The value of the 210 Boeing 737-8200 aircraft under the 2014 Boeing\nContract is approximately U.S.$9.6bn at standard list price of U.S.$102.5m per aircraft (net of basic credits and reflective\nof price escalation over the originally scheduled delivery timeframe). The first Boeing 737-8200 aircraft was delivered to\nRyanair in June 2021 and the Group had 146 of these aircraft in its fleet at March 31, 2024.\nIn May 2023, the Group entered into an agreement with The Boeing Company to purchase up to 300 new Boeing\n737-MAX-10 aircraft (150 firm orders and 150 aircraft subject to option) over a seven-year period from calendar 2027 to\n2033 (inclusive). This agreement was approved by shareholders at the Company’s AGM on September 14, 2023. The\nvalue of the 150 firm Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft under the 2023 Boeing Contract is over U.S.$10.6bn at standard list\nprice of U.S.$135m per aircraft (net of basic credits and reflective of price escalation over the originally scheduled\ndelivery timeframe).\nEXCHANGE CONTROLS\nExcept as indicated below, there are no restrictions on non-residents of Ireland dealing in Irish securities\n(including shares or depositary receipts of Irish companies such as the Company). Dividends and redemption proceeds\nalso continue to be freely transferable to non-resident holders of such securities.\nIt is an offence under Irish law (pursuant to various statutory instruments) to transfer funds or make funds or\neconomic resources available, directly or indirectly to any person or entity in contravention of Irish, EU or United Nations\nsanctions or to otherwise contravene Irish, EU or United Nations sanctions. Any transfer of, or payment in respect of,\nsecurities (including shares or ADSs) involving a person or entity that is currently the subject of Irish, EU or United Nations\nsanctions or any person or entity controlled by any of the foregoing, or any person acting on behalf of the foregoing, may\nbe subject to restrictions pursuant to such sanctions as implemented into Irish law.\nUnder the Financial Transfers Act 1992 (the “1992 Act”), the Minister for Finance of Ireland may make provision\nfor the restriction of financial transfers between Ireland and other countries. Financial transfers are broadly defined, and\nthe acquisition or disposal of the ADRs, which represent shares issued by an Irish incorporated company, the acquisition\nor the disposal of Ordinary Shares and associated payments may fall within this definition. Dividends or payments on\n77\nthe redemption or purchase of shares and payments on the liquidation of an Irish-incorporated company would fall\nwithin this definition.\nThe 1992 Act and underlying EU regulations prohibit financial transfers with certain persons and entities listed\nin the EU Consolidated Financial Sanctions List and United Nations Security Council Consolidated List, without the prior\npermission of the Central Bank of Ireland.\nSee “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Company” in relation to the risks associated with Irish exchange controls\nor orders under the 1992 Act or United Nations sanctions implemented into Irish law.\nLIMITATIONS ON SHARE OWNERSHIP BY NON-EU NATIONALS\nThe Board of Directors of Ryanair Holdings is given certain powers under the Articles to take action to ensure\nthat the number of Ordinary Shares held in Ryanair Holdings by non-EU nationals does not reach a level which could\njeopardize the Company’s entitlement to continue to hold or enjoy the benefit of any license, permit, consent or privilege\nwhich it holds or enjoys, and which enables it to carry on business as an air carrier (a “License”). In particular, EU\nRegulation 1008/2008 requires that, in order to obtain and retain an operating license, an EU air carrier must be majority-\nowned and effectively controlled by EU nationals. As described below, the Directors from time to time set a “Permitted\nMaximum” on the number of Ordinary Shares that may be owned by non-EU nationals at such level as they believe will\ncomply with EU law. The Permitted Maximum is currently set at 49.9%.\nIn accordance with its Articles, Ryanair Holdings maintains a separate register (the “Separate Register”) of\nOrdinary Shares in which non-EU nationals, whether individuals, bodies corporate or other entities, have an interest (such\nshares are referred to as “Affected Shares” in the Articles). Interest in this context is widely defined and includes any\ninterest held through ADRs, through Belgian law rights in the Euroclear Bank settlement system, or through CREST\nDepositary Interests, in each case in the Ordinary Shares of Ryanair Holdings underlying the relevant ADRs, Belgian law\nrights or CREST Depositary Interests. The Directors can require relevant parties to provide them with information to\nenable a determination to be made by the Directors as to whether Ordinary Shares are, or are to be treated as, Affected\nShares. If such information is not available or forthcoming or is unsatisfactory then the Directors can, at their discretion,\ndetermine that Ordinary Shares are to be treated as Affected Shares. Registered holders of Ordinary Shares are also\nobliged to notify the Company if they are aware that any Ordinary Share which they hold ought to be treated as an\nAffected Share for this purpose. With regard to ADRs, the Directors can treat all of the relevant underlying shares as\nAffected Shares unless satisfactory evidence as to why they should not be so treated is forthcoming.\nIn the event that, inter alia, (i) the refusal, withholding, suspension or revocation of any License or the imposition\nof any condition which materially inhibits the exercise of any License (an “Intervening Act”) has taken place, (ii) the\nCompany (or any subsidiary) receives a notice or direction from any governmental body or any other body which\nregulates the provision of air transport services to the effect that an Intervening Act is imminent, threatened or intended,\n(iii) an Intervening Act may occur as a consequence of the level of non-EU ownership of Ordinary Shares or (iv) an\nIntervening Act is imminent, threatened or intended because of the manner of share ownership or control of Ryanair\nHoldings generally, the Directors can take action pursuant to the Articles to deal with the situation. They can, inter alia,\n(i) remove any Directors or change the chairman of the Board of Directors, (ii) identify those Ordinary Shares, ADRs or\nAffected Shares which give rise to the need to take action and treat such Ordinary Shares, ADRs, or Affected Shares as\nRestricted Shares (see below) or (iii) set a “Permitted Maximum” on the number of Affected Shares which may subsist\nat any time (which may not, save in the circumstances referred to below, be lower than 40% of the total number of issued\nshares) and treat any Affected Shares (or ADRs representing such Affected Shares) in excess of this Permitted\nMaximum as Restricted Shares (see below).\n78\nIn addition to the above, if as a consequence of a change of law or a direction, notice or requirement of any\nstate, authority or person it is necessary to reduce the total number of Affected Shares below 40% or reduce the number\nof Affected Shares held by any particular shareholder or shareholders in order to overcome, prevent or avoid an\nIntervening Act, the Directors may resolve to (i) set the Permitted Maximum at such level below 40% as they consider\nnecessary in order to overcome, prevent or avoid such Intervening Act, and/or (ii) treat such number of Affected Shares\n(or ADRs representing Affected Shares) held by any particular shareholder or shareholders as they consider necessary\n(which could include all of such Affected Shares or ADRs) as Restricted Shares (see below). The Directors may serve a\nRestricted Share Notice in respect of any Affected Share, or any ADR representing any ADS, which is to be treated as a\nRestricted Share. Holders of Restricted Shares may be deprived of the rights to attend, vote and speak at general\nmeetings, which they would otherwise have as a consequence of holding such Ordinary Shares or ADRs. Holders of\nRestricted Shares may also be required to dispose of the Ordinary Shares or ADRs concerned to an EU national (so that\nthe relevant shares (or shares underlying the relevant ADRs) will then cease to be Affected Shares) within 21 days or\nsuch longer period as the Directors may determine. The Directors are also given the power to transfer and sell such\nRestricted Shares, themselves, in cases of non-compliance with the Restricted Share Notice.\nTo enable the Directors to identify Affected Shares, transferees of Ordinary Shares are generally required to\nprovide a declaration as to the nationality of persons having interests in those shares. Shareholders are also obliged to\nnotify Ryanair Holdings if they are aware that any shares, which they hold, ought to be treated as Affected Shares for\nthis purpose. Purchasers or transferees of ADRs need not complete a nationality declaration because the Directors\nautomatically treat all of the Ordinary Shares held by the Depositary as Affected Shares. ADS holders must open ADR\naccounts directly with the Depositary if they wish to provide to Ryanair Holdings nationality declarations (or such other\nevidence as the Directors may require) in order to establish to the Directors’ satisfaction that the Ordinary Shares\nunderlying such holder’s ADRs are not Affected Shares. Holders of interests in Ordinary Shares through Belgian law\nrights in the Euroclear system or CREST Depositary Interests in the CREST system must complete a nationality\ndeclaration in accordance with the processes and procedures of Euroclear Bank and Euroclear UK & Ireland respectively.\nIn deciding which Affected Shares are to be selected as Restricted Shares, the Directors may take into account\nwhich Affected Shares have given rise to the necessity to take action. Subject to that they will, insofar as practicable,\nfirstly view as Restricted Shares those Affected Shares in respect of which no declaration as to whether or not such\nshares are Affected Shares has been made by the holder thereof and where information which has been requested by\nthe Directors in accordance with the Articles has not been provided within specified time periods and, secondly, have\nregard to the chronological order in which details of Affected Shares have been entered in the Separate Register and,\naccordingly, treat the most recently registered Affected Shares as Restricted Shares to the extent necessary. Transfers\nof Affected Shares to Affiliates (as that expression is defined in the Articles) will not affect the chronological order of\nentry in the Separate Register for this purpose. The Directors do however have the discretion to apply another basis of\nselection if, in their sole opinion, that would be more equitable. Where the Directors have resolved to treat Affected\nShares held by any particular shareholder or shareholders as Restricted Shares (i) because such Affected Shares have\ngiven rise to the need to take such action or (ii) because of a change of law or a requirement or direction of a regulatory\nauthority necessitating such action (see above), such powers may be exercised irrespective of the date upon which such\nAffected Shares were entered in the Separate Register.\nThe Permitted Maximum is currently set at 49.9%. This maximum level can be reduced at any time if it becomes\nnecessary for the Directors to exercise their powers in the circumstances described above. The decision to make any\nsuch reduction or to change the Permitted Maximum from time to time will be published in at least one national\nnewspaper in Ireland and in any country in which the Ordinary Shares or ADRs are listed. The relevant notice will specify\nthe provisions of the Articles that apply to Restricted Shares and the name of the person or persons who will answer\nqueries relating to Restricted Shares on behalf of Ryanair Holdings. The Directors shall publish information as to the\nnumber of shares held by EU nationals annually.\n79\nIn an effort to increase the percentage of its share capital held by EU nationals, on June 26, 2001, Ryanair\nHoldings instructed the Depositary to suspend the issuance of new ADSs in exchange for the deposit of Ordinary Shares\nuntil further notice to its shareholders. Holders of Ordinary Shares cannot convert their Ordinary Shares into ADRs during\nsuch suspension, and there can be no assurance that the suspension will ever be lifted.\nAs a further measure to increase the percentage of Ordinary Shares held by EU nationals, on February 7, 2002,\nthe Company issued a notice to shareholders to the effect that any purchase of interests in Ordinary Shares by a non-\nEU national after such date will immediately result in the issue of a Restricted Share Notice to such non-EU national\npurchaser. The Restricted Share Notice compels the non-EU national purchaser to sell the interests in Affected Shares\nto an EU national within 21 days of the date of issuance. In the event that any such non-EU national shareholder does\nnot sell its interests in Ordinary Shares to an EU national within the specified time period, the Company can then compel\nsuch a sale. As a result, non-EU nationals are effectively barred from purchasing Ordinary Shares for as long as these\nrestrictions remain in place. There can be no assurance that these restrictions will ever be lifted.\nAs an additional measure to manage the Company’s EU nationality requirements, at the EGM held on April 19,\n2012 the Company obtained a repurchase authority to enable the repurchase of ADRs for up to 5% of the issued share\ncapital of the Company traded on the NASDAQ. This authority (which in 2017 was increased to 10% of the issued share\ncapital of the Company traded on the NASDAQ) was renewed at each subsequent Annual General Meeting up to and\nincluding the September 2023 meeting.\nIn order to protect the Company’s operating license and ensure that the Company (and its subsidiary EU airlines)\nremain majority EU owned and controlled in the event of a no-deal or “hard” Brexit, on March 8, 2019 the Board resolved\nthat with effect from the date on which UK nationals cease to qualify as nationals of Member States for the purposes of\nArticle 4 of EU Regulation 1008/2008 all Ordinary Shares and Depositary Shares held by or on behalf of non-EU (including\nUK) shareholders would be treated as Restricted Shares.\nIn anticipation of the end of the Brexit transition period on December 31, 2020, on December 29, 2020 the\nCompany announced that, with effect from January 1, 2021 UK nationals would cease to qualify as EU nationals and in\naccordance with the resolutions passed by the Board of the Company on March 8, 2019 all Ordinary Shares and\nDepositary Shares held by or on behalf of non-EU nationals (including UK nationals) would be treated as “Restricted\nShares” (within the meaning of the Articles of Association). Restricted Share Notices were issued to the registered\nholder(s) of each Restricted Share specifying that the holder(s) of such shares are not entitled to attend, speak or vote\nat any general meeting of the Company for so long as those shares are treated as Restricted Shares pursuant to Article\n41(J)(i) of the Articles of Association. UK nationals are not required to dispose of Ordinary Shares which they purchased\nprior to January 1, 2021.\nIn January 2021, the Company published a notice in the Financial Times, the Irish Times and the Wall Street\nJournal to again notify and confirm to shareholders that with effect from January 1, 2021 UK nationals ceased to qualify\nas EU nationals and in accordance with the resolutions passed by the Board of the Company on March 8, 2019, all\nOrdinary Shares and Depositary Shares held by or on behalf of non-EU nationals (including UK nationals) are treated as\n“Restricted Shares” (within the meaning of the Articles of Association).\nWhile the vast majority of non-EU (including UK) investors in the Company comply with the prohibition on non-\nEU nationals acquiring Ordinary Shares and invest instead through the ADRs listed on NASDAQ, the Company has\nrecorded a number of acquisitions of its Ordinary Shares by non-EU nationals since January 1, 2021 in respect of which\nthe relevant investors did not comply with the disposal requirements in the Restricted Share Notices issued to them by\nthe Company. On September 8, 2021, the Company announced that it had initiated a forced sale in accordance with the\nArticles, that a broker had been appointed to conduct the sale(s) of such Ordinary Shares independently of, and\nuninfluenced by, the Company over a period of weeks, and that the net proceeds of such sale(s) would be transmitted\n80\nto the relevant investors in due course. The Company also disclosed that it may initiate further restricted share disposals\nfrom time to time and may elect to do so without further announcement. Further restricted share disposals occurred in\n2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024.\nIn December 2021, the Company delisted from the London Stock Exchange (“LSE”). Trading on the LSE as a\npercentage of overall trading volume in Ryanair’s Ordinary Shares reduced materially during 2021 such that the volume\nno longer justified the costs related to such listing and admission to trading. Moreover, delisting from the LSE\nconsolidated trading liquidity to one regulated market for the benefit of all shareholders. The migration away from the\nLSE was also consistent with the extension of the prohibition on non-EU nationals acquiring Ryanair’s Ordinary Shares\nto include UK nationals from January 1, 2021.\nNotwithstanding the powers vested in the chairman of general meetings of the Company pursuant to Article\n41(J)(i) of the Articles of Association, the chairman will not vote any Restricted Shares at any meeting of the Company.\nConcerns about the foreign ownership restrictions described above could result in the exclusion of Ryanair from\ncertain stock tracking indices. Any such exclusion may adversely affect the market price of the Ordinary Shares and\nADRs. See also “Item 3. Key Information—Risk Factors–Risks Related to Ownership of the Company’s Ordinary Shares\nor ADRs—EU Rules impose restrictions on the ownership of Ryanair Holdings’ ordinary shares by Non-EU nationals and\nthe Company has applied a ban on the purchase of ordinary shares by Non-EU nationals since 2002” above.\nAs a result of the measures introduced by the Company on January 1, 2021 to protect the Group’s operating\nlicenses under EU Regulation 1008/2008, as at March 31, 2024, EU nationals owned 100% of the Ryanair Holdings’\nOrdinary Shares with voting rights and over 48% of the Ryanair Holdings’ Ordinary Shares with economic rights (in each\ncase assuming conversion of all outstanding ADRs into Ordinary Shares).\nTAXATION\nIrish Tax Considerations\nThe following is a discussion of certain Irish tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of\nOrdinary Shares or ADRs. This discussion is based upon tax laws and practice of Ireland at the date of this document,\nwhich are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Particular rules may apply to certain classes of taxpayers\n(such as dealers in securities) and this discussion does not purport to deal with the tax consequences of purchase,\nownership or disposition of the relevant securities for all categories of investors.\nThe discussion is intended only as a general guide based on current Irish law and practice and is not intended\nto be, nor should it be considered to be, legal or tax advice to any particular investor or stockholder. Accordingly, current\nstockholders or potential investors should satisfy themselves as to the overall tax consequences by consulting their\nown tax advisers.\nDividends. If Ryanair Holdings plc pays dividends or makes other relevant distributions, the following is relevant:\nWithholding Tax. Unless exempted, a withholding tax (currently 25%) will apply to dividends or other relevant\ndistributions paid by an Irish resident company. The withholding tax requirement will not apply to distributions paid to\ncertain categories of Irish resident stockholders or to distributions paid to certain categories of non-resident\nstockholders.\n81\nThe following Irish resident stockholders, inter-alia, are exempt from withholding if they make to the Company,\nin advance of payment of any relevant distribution, an appropriate declaration of entitlement to exemption:\n• Irish resident companies;\n• Pension schemes approved by the Irish Revenue Commissioners (“Irish Revenue”);\n• Qualifying fund managers or qualifying savings managers in relation to approved retirement funds (“ARF”s) or\napproved minimum retirement funds (“AMRF”s);\n• Personal Retirement Savings Account (“PRSA”) administrators who receive the relevant distribution as income\narising in respect of PRSA assets;\n• A pan-European Personal Pension Product (“PEPP”) provider who is receiving the relevant distribution as income\narising in respect of PEPP assets;\n• Qualifying employee share ownership trusts;\n• Collective investment undertakings;\n• Tax-exempt charities;\n• Designated brokers receiving the distribution for special portfolio investment accounts;\n• Any person who is entitled to exemption from income tax under Schedule F on dividends in respect of an\ninvestment in whole or in part of payments received in respect of a civil action or from the Personal Injuries\nAssessment Board for damages in respect of mental or physical infirmity;\n• Certain qualifying trusts established for the benefit of an incapacitated individual and/or persons in receipt of\nincome from such a qualifying trust;\n• Any person entitled to exemption to income tax under Schedule F by virtue of Section 192(2) Taxes\nConsolidation Act (“TCA”) 1997;\n• Unit trusts to which Section 731(5)(a) TCA 1997 applies; and\n• Certain Irish Revenue-approved amateur and athletic sport bodies.\nThe following non-resident stockholders are exempt from withholding if they make to the Company, in advance\nof payment of any dividend, an appropriate declaration of entitlement to exemption:\n• Persons (other than a company) who (i) are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and (ii) are resident\nfor tax purposes in (a) a country which has signed a Double Taxation Agreement with Ireland (a “tax treaty\ncountry”) or (b) an EU member state other than Ireland;\n• Companies not resident in Ireland which are resident in an EU member state or a tax treaty country, by virtue of\nthe law of an EU member state or a tax treaty country and are not controlled, directly or indirectly, by an Irish\nresident or Irish residents;\n• Companies not resident in Ireland which are directly or indirectly controlled by a person or persons who are, by\nvirtue of the law of a tax treaty country or an EU member state, resident for tax purposes in a tax treaty country\nor an EU member state other than Ireland and which are not controlled directly or indirectly by persons who are\nnot resident for tax purposes in a tax treaty country or EU member state;\n• Companies not resident in Ireland the principal class of shares of which is substantially and regularly traded on\na recognized stock exchange in a tax treaty country or an EU member state including Ireland or on an approved\nstock exchange; or\n• Companies not resident in Ireland that are 75% subsidiaries of a single company, or are wholly owned by two or\nmore companies, in either case the principal classes of shares of which is or are substantially and regularly\ntraded on a recognized stock exchange in a tax treaty country or an EU member state including Ireland or on an\napproved stock exchange.\nIn the case of an individual non-resident stockholder resident in an EU member state or tax treaty country, the\ndeclaration must be accompanied by a current certificate of tax residence from the tax authorities in the stockholder’s\ncountry of residence. In the case of both an individual and corporate non-resident stockholder resident in an EU member\n82\nstate or tax treaty country, the declaration also must contain an undertaking by the individual or corporate non-resident\nstockholder that he, she or it will advise the Company accordingly if he, she or it ceases to meet the conditions to be\nentitled to the DWT exemption. No declaration is required if the stockholder is a 5% parent company in another EU\nmember state in accordance with section 831 TCA 1997. Neither is a declaration required on the payment by a company\nresident in Ireland to another company so resident if the company making the dividend is a 51% subsidiary of that other\ncompany.\nThe Irish Department of Finance had sought to introduce a Dividend Withholding Tax Real-Time Reporting\nsystem from January 1, 2021. Under this system, Irish resident companies would be required to obtain tax reference\nnumbers from shareholders in advance of making a distribution. A public consultation process between stakeholders,\nshareholders and representative bodies with the Irish Revenue Commissioners ran between October 2019 and March\n2020, the outcomes of which have yet to be published. One of the main areas of concern raised was regarding the\npracticality of managing such a system in respect of listed companies who have a large and diverse base of international\ninvestors. On May 19, 2020, having regard to the scale of the challenge facing the industry in preparing for the transfer\nof the Irish equities market to a new settlement system by March 2021, and business challenges and disruption caused\nby the Covid-19 pandemic, the Irish Revenue Commissioners postponed the planned introduction of the Real-Time\nReporting System from January 1, 2021 until an undefined later date. On March 1, 2021 Irish Revenue stated that they\nwill engage with stakeholders in advance of the resumption of the change management program and will ensure that\nadequate time is allocated to the delivery of any development work associated with Dividend Withholding Tax real-time\nreporting. Irish Revenue have not made any further statements on the issue.\nAmerican Depositary Receipts. Special arrangements with regard to the dividend withholding tax obligation apply\nin the case of Irish companies using ADRs through U.S. depositary banks that have been authorized by the Irish Revenue.\nSuch banks, which receive dividends from the Company and pass them on to the U.S. ADR holders beneficially entitled\nto such dividends, will be allowed to receive and pass on the gross dividends (i.e., before withholding) based on an\n“address system” where the recorded addresses of such holder, as listed in the depositary bank’s register of depositary\nreceipts, is in the United States.\nTaxation on Dividends. Companies’ resident in Ireland other than those taxable on receipt of dividends as trading\nincome are exempt from corporation tax on distributions received on Ordinary Shares from other Irish resident\ncompanies. Stockholders that are “close” companies for Irish taxation purposes may, however, be subject to a\ncorporation tax surcharge (currently 20%) on undistributed investment income.\nIndividual stockholders who are resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland are subject to income tax on the gross\ndividend at their marginal tax rate but are entitled to a credit for the tax withheld by the Company paying the dividend.\nThe dividend will also be subject to the universal social charge. An individual stockholder who is not liable or not fully\nliable for income tax by reason of exemption or otherwise may be entitled to receive an appropriate refund of tax\nwithheld. A charge to Irish social security taxes can also arise for such individuals on the amount of any dividend\nreceived from the Company.\nExcept in certain circumstances, a person who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and is entitled\nto receive dividends without deductions is not liable for Irish tax on the dividends. Where a person who is neither resident\nnor ordinarily resident in Ireland is subject to withholding tax on the dividend received due to not benefiting from any\nexemption from such withholding, the amount of that withholding will generally satisfy such person’s liability for Irish\ntax, however individual shareholders should confirm this with their own tax adviser.\nCapital Gains Tax. A person who is either resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland will generally be liable for Irish\ncapital gains tax on any gain realized on the disposal of the Ordinary Shares or ADRs. The current capital gains tax rate\nis 33%. A person who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and who does not carry on a trade in Ireland\nthrough a branch or agency will not be subject to Irish capital gains tax on the disposal of the Ordinary Shares or ADRs.\n83\nIrish Capital Acquisitions Tax. A gift or inheritance of the Ordinary Shares or ADRs will be within the charge to\nIrish Capital Acquisitions Tax (“CAT”) notwithstanding that the donor or the donee / successor in relation to such gift or\ninheritance is resident outside Ireland. CAT is charged at a rate of 33% above a tax-free threshold. This tax-free threshold\nis determined by the amount of the current benefit and of previous benefits taken since December 5, 1991, as relevant,\nwithin the charge to CAT and the relationship between the donor and the successor or donee. Gifts and inheritances\nbetween spouses (and in certain cases former spouses) are not subject to CAT.\nIn a case where an inheritance or gift of the Ordinary Shares or ADRs is subject to both Irish CAT and foreign tax\nof a similar character, the foreign tax paid may in certain circumstances be credited in whole or in part against the Irish\ntax.\nIrish Stamp Duty. It is assumed for the purposes of this paragraph that ADRs are dealt in on a recognized stock\nexchange in the United States (the NASDAQ being a recognized stock exchange in the United States for this purpose).\nUnder current Irish law, no stamp duty will be payable on the acquisition of ADRs by persons purchasing such ADRs or\non any subsequent transfer of ADRs. A transfer of Ordinary Shares (including transfers effected through a securities\nsettlement system) wherever executed and whether on sale, in contemplation of a sale or by way of a gift, will be subject\nto duty at the rate of 1% of the consideration given or, in the case of a gift or if the purchase price is inadequate or\nunascertainable, on the market value of the Ordinary Shares. Transfers of Ordinary Shares that are not liable for duty at\nthe rate of 1% (e.g., transfers under which there is no change in beneficial ownership) may be subject to a fixed duty of\n€12.50.\nThe Irish Revenue treats a conversion of Ordinary Shares to ADRs made in contemplation of a sale or a change\nin beneficial ownership (under Irish law) as an event subject to stamp duty at a rate of 1%. The Irish Revenue has\nindicated that a re-conversion of ADRs to Ordinary Shares made in contemplation of a sale or a change in beneficial\nownership (under Irish law) will not be subject to a stamp duty. However, the subsequent sale of the re-converted\nOrdinary Shares may give rise to Irish stamp duty at the 1% rate. If the transfer of the Ordinary Shares is a transfer under\nwhich there is no change in the beneficial ownership (under Irish law) of the Ordinary Shares being transferred, nominal\nstamp duty only may be payable on the transfer. Under Irish law, it is not clear whether the mere deposit of Ordinary\nShares for ADRs or ADRs for Ordinary Shares would be deemed to constitute a change in beneficial ownership.\nAccordingly, it is possible that holders would be subject to stamp duty at the 1% rate when merely depositing Ordinary\nShares for ADRs or ADRs for Ordinary Shares and, consequently, the Depositary reserves the right in such circumstances\nto require payment of stamp duty at the rate of 1% from the holders.\nThe person accountable for payment of stamp duty is the transferee or, in the case of a transfer by way of a gift\nor for a consideration less than the market value, all parties to the transfer. Stamp duty is normally payable within 30\ndays after the date of execution of the transfer, although the Irish e-Stamping system allows for 44 days. Late or\ninadequate payment of stamp duty will result in liability for interest, penalties, and fines.\nUnited States Federal Income Tax Considerations\nThe following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the purchase, ownership\nand disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADRs by a beneficial owner of the Ordinary Shares or ADRs who is a citizen or\nresident of the United States, a U.S. domestic corporation or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income\nbasis in respect of the Ordinary Shares or the ADRs (a “U.S. Holder”). This summary does not purport to be tax advice or\na comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase, hold, or\ndispose of the Ordinary Shares or the ADRs. In particular, the summary deals only with U.S. Holders that will hold Ordinary\nShares or ADRs as capital assets and generally does not address the tax treatment of U.S. Holders that may be subject\nto special tax rules such as banks, regulated investment companies, insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations\ndealers in securities or currencies, partnerships or partners therein, entities subject to the branch profits tax, traders in\nsecurities electing to mark to market, persons that own 10% or more of the stock of the Company (measured by vote or\n84\nvalue), persons whose “functional currency” is not U.S. dollars or persons that hold the Ordinary Shares or the ADRs as\na synthetic security or as part of an integrated investment (including a “straddle” or hedge) consisting of the Ordinary\nShares or the ADRs and one or more other positions. Moreover, this summary does not address state, local or foreign\ntaxes, the U.S. federal estate and gift taxes, the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income of certain non-\ncorporate U.S. Holders, or alternative minimum tax consequences of acquiring, holding or disposing of Ordinary Shares\nor ADSs.\nThis summary is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), its legislative history,\nexisting and proposed regulations promulgated thereunder, published rulings and court decisions, all as currently in\neffect. These authorities are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. In addition, this summary assumes the\ndeposit agreement, and all other related agreements, will be performed in accordance with their terms.\nHolders of the Ordinary Shares or the ADRs should consult their own tax advisors as to the U.S. or other tax\nconsequences of the purchase, ownership, and disposition of the Ordinary Shares or the ADRs in light of their particular\ncircumstances, including, in particular, the effect of any foreign, state or local tax laws.\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, holders of the ADRs generally will be treated as the beneficial owners of\nthe Ordinary Shares represented by those ADRs.\nTaxation of Dividends\nThe gross amount of any dividends (including any amount withheld in respect of Irish taxes) paid with respect\nto the Ordinary Shares, including Ordinary Shares represented by ADRs, will generally be includible in the taxable income\nof a U.S. Holder when the dividends are received by the holder, in the case of Ordinary Shares, or when received by the\nDepositary, in the case of ADRs. Such dividends will not be eligible for the “dividends received” deduction allowed to U.S.\ncorporations in respect of dividends from a domestic corporation. Dividends paid in euro generally should be included\nin the income of a U.S. Holder in a U.S. dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the day\nthey are received by the holder, in the case of Ordinary Shares, or the Depositary, in the case of ADRs. U.S. Holders\ngenerally should not be required to recognize any foreign currency gain or loss to the extent such dividends paid in euro\nare converted into U.S. dollars immediately upon receipt.\nSubject to certain exceptions for short-term and hedged positions, the U.S. dollar amount of dividends received\nby an individual with respect to the Ordinary Shares or ADRs will be taxable at the preferential rates for “qualified\ndividends” if (i) the Company is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States that\nthe Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has approved for the purposes of the qualified dividend rules and (ii) the Company\nwas not, in the year prior to the year in which the dividend is paid, and is not, in the year in which the dividend is paid, a\npassive foreign investment company (a “PFIC”). The Convention between the Government of the United States of\nAmerica and the Government of Ireland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with\nRespect to Taxes on Income and Capital Gains, dated as of July 28, 1999 (the “U.S.-Ireland Income Tax Treaty”) has\nbeen approved for the purposes of the qualified dividend rules. Based on the Company’s audited financial statements\nand relevant market data, the Company believes that it was not treated as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nwith respect to its 2022 and 2023 taxable years. In addition, based on the Company’s audited financial statements and\nits current expectations regarding the value and nature of its assets, the sources and nature of its income, and relevant\nmarket data, the Company does not expect to be a PFIC for its 2024 taxable year.\n85\nDividends received by U.S. Holders generally will constitute foreign source and “passive category” income for\nU.S. foreign tax credit purposes. Subject to limitations under U.S. federal income tax law concerning credits or\ndeductions for foreign taxes, any Irish taxes withheld at the appropriate rate from cash dividends on the Ordinary Shares\nor ADRs may be treated as a foreign income tax eligible for credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability\n(or at a U.S. Holder’s election, may be deducted in computing taxable income if the U.S. Holder has elected to deduct all\nforeign income taxes for the taxable year). As a result of new requirements adopted by the IRS in regulations\npromulgated in December 2021, Irish dividend withholding taxes generally will need to satisfy certain additional\nrequirements in order for a credit to be allowed.\nIn the case of a U.S. Holder that either (i) is eligible for, and properly elects, the benefits of the U.S.-Ireland\nIncome Tax Treaty, or (ii) consistently elects to apply a modified version of these rules under recently issued temporary\nguidance and complies with specific requirements set forth in such guidance, the Irish tax on dividends will be treated\nas meeting the new requirements and therefore as a creditable tax. In the case of all other U.S. Holders, the application\nof these requirements to the Irish dividend withholding tax is uncertain and, accordingly, no assurance can be given that\nany Irish withholding tax will be creditable. If the Irish dividend withholding tax is not a creditable tax for a U.S. Holder or\nthe U.S. Holder does not elect to claim a foreign tax credit for any foreign income taxes, the U.S. Holder may be able to\ndeduct the Irish tax in computing such U.S. Holder’s taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The temporary\nguidance discussed above also indicated that the Treasury and the IRS are considering proposing amendments to the\nDecember 2021 regulations and that the temporary guidance can be relied upon until additional guidance is issued that\nwithdraws or modifies the temporary guidance. Given the added complexity of the U.S. foreign tax credit rules, U.S.\nHolders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the implications of these rules in light of their particular\ncircumstances.\nDistributions of Ordinary Shares that are made as part of a pro rata distribution to all stockholders generally\nshould not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, unless the U.S. Holder has the right to receive cash or property instead,\nin which case the U.S. Holder will be treated as if it received cash equal to the fair market value of the distribution.\nTaxation of Capital Gains\nUpon a sale or other disposition of the Ordinary Shares or ADRs, U.S. Holders will recognize a gain or loss for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount\nrealized on the disposition and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis, determined in U.S. dollars, in the Ordinary Shares or ADRs.\nGenerally, such gains or losses will be capital gains or losses and will be long-term capital gains or losses if the Ordinary\nShares or ADRs have been held for more than one year. Short-term capital gains are subject to U.S. federal income\ntaxation at ordinary income rates, while long-term capital gains realized by a U.S. Holder that is an individual generally\nare subject to taxation at preferential rates. Gains realized by a U.S. Holder generally should constitute income from\nsources within the United States for foreign tax credit purposes and generally should constitute “passive category”\nincome for such purposes. The deductibility of capital losses, in excess of capital gains, is subject to limitations.\nDeposits and withdrawals of Ordinary Shares by U.S. Holders in exchange for ADRs should not result in the\nrealization of gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nForeign Financial Asset Reporting\nCertain U.S. Holders that own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of\nU.S.$50,000 on the last day of the taxable year or U.S.$75,000 at any time during the taxable year are generally required\nto file an information statement along with their tax returns, currently on IRS Form 8938, with respect to such assets.\n“Specified foreign financial assets” include any financial accounts held at a non-U.S. financial institution, as well as\nsecurities issued by a non-U.S. issuer that are not held in accounts maintained by financial institutions. The\nunderstatement of income attributable to “specified foreign financial assets” in excess of U.S.$5,000 extends the statute\n86\nof limitations with respect to the tax return to six years after the return was filed. U.S. Holders who fail to report the\nrequired information could be subject to substantial penalties. Holders are encouraged to consult with their own tax\nadvisors regarding the possible application of these rules, including the application of the rules to their particular\ncircumstances.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nDividends paid on, and proceeds from, the sale or other disposition of the Ordinary Shares or ADRs that are\nmade within the United States or through certain U.S. related financial intermediaries generally will be subject to\ninformation reporting and may also be subject to backup withholding unless the holder (i) provides a correct taxpayer\nidentification number and certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding or (ii) otherwise establish an exemption\nfrom backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld may be allowed as a refund\nor credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to\nthe IRS.\nDOCUMENTS ON DISPLAY\nCopies of Ryanair Holdings’ Articles may be examined at its registered office and principal place of business at\nDublin Office, Airside Business Park, Swords, County Dublin, K67 NY94, Ireland and are also available on the Ryanair\nwebsite.\nRyanair Holdings also files reports, including Annual Reports on Form 20-F, periodic reports on Form 6-K and\nother information, with the SEC pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC that apply to foreign private issuers.\nYou may read and copy any materials filed with the SEC at its Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington,\nD.C. 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-\n0330.\nItem 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nGENERAL\nRyanair is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, carbon pricing, interest rates\nand currency exchange rates. The objective of financial risk management at Ryanair is to minimize the negative impact\nof commodity price, interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the Company’s earnings, cash flows and\nequity.\nTo manage these risks, Ryanair uses various derivative financial instruments, including cross currency swaps,\ninterest rate swaps, foreign currency forward contracts, commodity forwards and options. These derivative financial\ninstruments are generally held to maturity and are not actively traded. The Company enters into these arrangements\nwith the goal of hedging its operational and balance sheet risk. However, Ryanair’s exposure to commodity price, interest\nrate and currency exchange rate fluctuations cannot be neutralized completely.\nIn executing its risk management strategy, Ryanair currently enters into forward swap contracts and call options\nfor the purchase of some of the jet fuel (jet kerosene) that it expects to use. It also uses foreign currency forward\ncontracts intended to reduce its exposure to risks related to foreign currencies, principally the U.S. dollar. Furthermore,\nit enters into interest rate contracts with the objective of fixing certain borrowing costs and hedging principal\nrepayments, particularly those associated with the purchase of new Boeing 737-8200s. Ryanair is also exposed to the\nrisk that the counterparties to its derivative financial instruments may not be creditworthy. If a counterparty was to\ndefault on its obligations under any of the instruments described below, Ryanair’s economic expectations when entering\n87\ninto these arrangements might not be achieved and its financial condition could be adversely affected. Transactions\ninvolving derivative financial instruments are also relatively illiquid as compared with those involving other kinds of\nfinancial instruments. It is Ryanair’s policy not to enter into transactions involving financial derivatives for speculative\npurposes.\nThe following paragraphs describe Ryanair’s fuel hedging, carbon hedging, foreign currency and interest rate\nswap arrangements and analyze the sensitivity of the market value, earnings and cash flows of the financial instruments\nto hypothetical changes in commodity prices, carbon prices, interest rates and exchange rates as if these changes had\noccurred at March 31, 2024. The range of changes selected for this sensitivity analysis reflects Ryanair’s view of the\nchanges that are reasonably possible over a one-year period.\nFUEL PRICE EXPOSURE AND HEDGING\nFuel costs constitute a substantial portion of Ryanair’s operating expenses (approximately 45% and 43% of such\nexpenses in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively). Ryanair engages in fuel price hedging transactions from time to\ntime. Fuel hedging is achieved via fuel forward swap contracts and fuel call options. In a fuel forward swap transaction\nRyanair and a counterparty agree to exchange payments equal to the difference between a fixed price for a given quantity\nof jet fuel and the market price for such quantity of jet fuel at a given date in the future, with Ryanair receiving the amount\nof any excess of such market price over such fixed price and paying to the counterparty the amount of any deficit of\nsuch fixed price under such market price. In a fuel call option transaction, a counterparty provides Ryanair with the right,\nbut not the obligation, to purchase a fixed price for a given quantity of jet fuel in exchange for the market price at a given\ndate in the future.\nRyanair has historically entered into arrangements providing for substantial protection against fluctuations in\nfuel prices, generally through forward swap contracts covering periods of up to 12 to 18 months of anticipated jet fuel\nrequirements. See “Item 3. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Company—Changes in fuel costs and\navailability affect the Company’s results” for additional information on recent trends in fuel costs and the Company’s\nrelated hedging activities, as well as certain associated risks. See also “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and\nProspects—Fiscal year 2024 compared with fiscal year 2023—Fuel and oil.” For the fiscal year 2024, Ryanair had entered\ninto jet fuel forward swap contracts and fuel call options covering approximately 84% of fuel requirements (2023: 81%).\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company had entered into jet fuel forward swap contracts covering approximately 70% of its\nestimated requirements for the fiscal year 2025 at prices equivalent to approximately U.S.$795 per metric ton. The\nCompany has designated the fuel forward swap contracts as hedging instruments in a hedge relationship. The Company\nbelieves these hedges to be effective for hedge accounting purposes.\nWhile these hedging strategies can cushion the impact on Ryanair of fuel price increases in the short term, in\nthe medium to longer-term, such strategies cannot be expected to eliminate the impact on the Company of an increase\nin the market price of jet fuel. The unrealized gains or losses on outstanding forward swap contracts and option\nagreements at March 31, 2024 and 2023, based on their fair values, amounted to a €190m gain and €344m loss (gross\nof tax), respectively. Based on Ryanair’s fuel consumption for fiscal year 2024, a change of U.S.$1.00 in the average\nannual price per metric ton of jet fuel (before the impact of derivatives) would have caused a change of approximately\n€4.8m in Ryanair’s fuel costs. See “Item 3. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Company—Changes in\nfuel costs and availability affect the company’s results.”\nUnder IFRS, the Company’s fuel forward swap contracts are treated as cash flow hedges of forecast fuel\npurchases for risks arising from the commodity price of fuel. The contracts are recorded at fair value in the balance\nsheet and are re-measured to fair value at the end of each fiscal period through equity to the extent effective, with any\nineffectiveness recorded through the income statement. In fiscal year 2024, the Company recorded a positive fair-value\n88\nadjustment of €166m (net of tax), and in fiscal year 2023, the Company recorded a negative fair-value adjustment of\n€302m (net of tax) within accumulated other comprehensive income in respect of jet fuel forward swap contracts.\nCARBON EXPOSURE AND HEDGING\nRyanair engages in carbon hedging transactions in relation to obligations arising under the EU and UK Emission\nTrading Schemes. This hedging is achieved via forward contracts. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had entered into\nforward carbon hedging contracts covering approximately 100% of its estimated requirements for the fiscal year 2025\nand approximately 28% of its estimated requirements for the fiscal year 2026 at prices equivalent to approximately €76\nand €57 per allowance respectively. The Company has designated the carbon forward contracts as hedging instruments\nin a hedge relationship. The Company believes these hedges to be effective for hedge accounting purposes.\nWhile these hedging strategies can cushion the impact on Ryanair of carbon price increases in the short term,\nin the medium to longer-term, such strategies cannot be expected to eliminate the impact on the Company of an increase\nin carbon market prices. The unrealized loss on outstanding carbon forward agreements at March 31, 2024, based on\ntheir fair values, amounted to a €163m loss. Based on Ryanair’s ETS exposure for fiscal year 2024, a change of €1.00 in\nthe average ETS allowance price per CO2 ton would have caused a change of approximately €8m in Ryanair’s carbon\ncosts.\nIn fiscal year 2024, the Group recognized a cost associated with the purchase of carbon credits in the income\nstatement within ‘Fuel and oil’ of approximately €690m (2023: €425m).\nFOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE AND HEDGING\nIn recent years, Ryanair’s revenues have been denominated primarily in two currencies, the euro and the UK\npound sterling. The euro and the UK pound sterling accounted for approximately 67% and 22%, respectively, of Ryanair’s\ntotal revenues in fiscal year 2024 (2023: 68% and 21% respectively). As Ryanair reports its results in euro, the Company\nis not exposed to any material currency risk as a result of its euro-denominated activities. Ryanair’s operating expenses\nare primarily euro, UK pounds sterling and U.S. dollars. Ryanair’s operations can be subject to significant direct exchange\nrate risks between the euro and the U.S. dollar because a significant portion of its operating costs (particularly those\nrelated to fuel purchases) is incurred in U.S. dollars, while practically none of its revenues are denominated in U.S.\ndollars. Appreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar positively impacts Ryanair’s operating income because the euro\nequivalent of its U.S. dollar operating costs decreases, while depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar negatively\nimpacts operating income. It is Ryanair’s policy to hedge a significant portion of its exposure to fluctuations in the\nexchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro. From time to time, Ryanair hedges its operating cash flows in UK\npound sterling. Ryanair may choose to sell surplus UK pound sterling cash flows for euro after satisfying its UK pound\nsterling obligations.\nHedging associated with the income statement. In fiscal years 2024 and 2023, the Company entered into a series\nof forward contracts, principally euro/U.S. dollar forward contracts to hedge against variability in cash flows arising from\nmarket fluctuations in foreign exchange rates associated with its forecast fuel, maintenance and insurance costs. At\nMarch 31, 2024, the total unrealized gain relating to these contracts amounted to approximately €86m, compared to a\n€37m total unrealized loss at March 31, 2023.\nUnder IFRS, these foreign currency forward contracts are treated as cash flow hedges of forecast U.S. dollar\nand UK pound sterling purchases to address the risks arising from U.S. dollar and UK pound sterling exchange rates.\nThe derivatives are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet and are re-measured to fair value at the end of each\nreporting period through equity to the extent effective, with ineffectiveness recorded through the income statement.\nRyanair considers these hedges to be highly effective in offsetting variability in future cash flows arising from\n89\nfluctuations in exchange rates, because the forward contracts are timed so as to match exactly the amount, currency\nand maturity date of the forecast foreign currency-denominated expense being hedged.\nHedging associated with the balance sheet. In prior years, the Company entered into a series of cross currency\ninterest rate swaps to manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates of U.S. dollar-denominated floating\nrate borrowings, together with managing the exposures to fluctuations in interest rates on these U.S. dollar-denominated\nfloating rate borrowings. Cross currency interest rate swaps were primarily used to convert a portion of the Company’s\nU.S. dollar-denominated debt to euro and floating rate interest exposures into fixed rate exposures and were set so as\nto match exactly the critical terms of the underlying debt being hedged (i.e. notional principal, interest rate settings, re-\npricing dates). These cross currency interest rate swaps matured in fiscal year 2024.\nHedging associated with capital expenditures. During fiscal years 2024 and 2023, the Company also held a series\nof euro/U.S. dollar contracts to hedge against changes in the fair value of aircraft purchase commitments under the\nBoeing contracts, which arise from fluctuations in the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rates. At March 31, 2024, the total\nunrealized gain relating to these contracts amounted to €57m, compared to €260m unrealized gain at March 31, 2023.\nUnder IFRS, the Company generally accounts for these contracts as cash flow hedges. Cash flow hedges are\nrecorded at fair value in the balance sheet and are re-measured to fair value at the end of the financial period through\nequity to the extent effective, with any ineffectiveness recorded through the income statement. The Company has found\nthese hedges to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the aircraft purchase commitments arising\nfrom fluctuations in exchange rates because the forward exchange contracts are always for the same amount, currency\nand maturity dates as the corresponding aircraft purchase commitments.\nA plus or minus change of 10% in relevant foreign currency exchange rates, based on outstanding foreign\ncurrency-denominated financial assets and financial liabilities at March 31, 2024 would have a positive impact of\napproximately €77m on the income statement (net of tax) (2023: €46m; 2022: €26m) if the rate fell by 10%, and a\nnegative impact of approximately €63m on the income statement (net of tax) (2023: €38m; 2022: €2m) if the rate\nincreased by 10%. The same movement of 10% in foreign currency exchange rates would have a positive approximately\n€501m impact (net of tax) on equity if the rate fell by 10% and a negative €410m impact (net of tax) if the rate increased\nby 10% (2023: €677m positive or €554m negative; 2022: €695m positive or €588m negative).\nINTEREST RATE EXPOSURE AND HEDGING\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2022, the Group issued promissory notes to the value of approximately €0.2bn\nwith maturity dates of October 2023. The notes were issued in settlement of certain aircraft trade payables and were\nnon-interest bearing. These were non-cash settled in full during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.\nInterest rate risk. Based on the levels of and composition of year-end interest bearing assets and liabilities,\nincluding derivatives, at March 31, 2024, a plus one percentage point movement in interest rates would result in a\nrespective increase of approximately €42m (net of tax) in net finance income (2023: increase in net finance expense of\n€92m; 2022: decrease in net finance expense of €19m) and a minus one percentage point movement in interest rates\nwould result in a respective decrease of approximately €16m in net finance income in the income statement (2023:\ndecrease in net finance expense of €49m; 2022: increase in net finance expense of €33m;) and a nil increase or decrease\nin equity (2023: nil 2022: nil).\n90\nItem 12.

The program utilises guidance drawn from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology Cybersecurity Framework to set the cybersecurity agenda and prioritise cybersecurity activities. The\nstrategies employed by the program, among others, include:\n• the application of policies and procedures designed to comply with data security and privacy obligations;\n• the implementation of administrative, technical, and physical controls;\n• the utilisation of a Security Operations Center that conducts ongoing monitoring of networks and systems for\npotential signs of suspicious activity;\n• the requirement that staff complete cybersecurity training, which is updated as new technology, security and\nprivacy issues emerge;\n• the tracking of key performance indicators and cybersecurity metrics to evaluate existing cybersecurity controls\nand practices;\n• maintaining a cybersecurity incident response plan to respond to cybersecurity incidents, which includes\nstandard processes for reporting, escalating and recommending remediation actions for cybersecurity incidents\nto senior management; and\n• conducting periodic simulated cybersecurity scenarios to provide hands-on training and test the preparedness\nof the team to deal with cybersecurity threats.\nCybersecurity Governance\nBoard and Audit Committee\nThe Board is responsible for overseeing management’s assessment of major risks, including cybersecurity,\nfacing the Company and for reviewing options to mitigate such risks. The Board’s oversight of major risks, including\ncybersecurity risks, occurs at both the full Board level and at the Board committee level through the Audit Committee.\nThe Company benefits from certain Board and Audit Committee members having considerable IT, data and cyber\nexperience.\nThe Audit Committee regularly receives updates on cybersecurity risks and the security and operations of the\nCompany’s information technology systems from the Chief Technology Officer (“CTO”). These updates generally include\nany significant cybersecurity incidents, cybersecurity threats, cybersecurity program enhancements, and cybersecurity\nrisks and related mitigation activities. This reporting helps to provide the Audit Committee with an informed\nunderstanding of the Company’s dynamic cybersecurity program and threat landscape. The Audit Committee also\nreceives an ERM framework twice a year, in which material cybersecurity risks are identified, assessed and managed.\nThe Audit Committee has opportunities to report regularly to the Board and review any major issues that arise\nat the committee level, which may include cybersecurity risks. Senior Management (including the CTO) also brief Board\nmembers, including new members, on cybersecurity risks. Based on this information, Board members may request\nadditional information to address any concerns.\nManagement\nThe Company has a dedicated cybersecurity organization within its technology department that focuses on\ncurrent and emerging cybersecurity matters. The Company’s cybersecurity function is led by the Head of Information\nSecurity, who reports to the CTO.\nThe Company’s cybersecurity function engages in a range of cybersecurity activities such as threat detection,\nsecurity mechanisms, and incident response. The cybersecurity function conducts vulnerability management and\npenetration testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. Regular meetings are held with the Head of Information\n96\nSecurity and the CTO to provide visibility of major issues and seek alignment with strategy. As noted in the “Risk\nassessment, policies and procedures” section above, the Company’s cybersecurity incident response plan includes\nstandard processes for reporting, escalating and recommending remediation actions for cybersecurity incidents to\nSenior Management. Cybersecurity incidents that meet certain thresholds are escalated to the cybersecurity leaders\nand cross-functional teams on an as-needed basis for support and guidance.\nThe Head of Information Security has 30 years of IT experience across manufacturing, banking and aviation,\nincluding 12 years of cybersecurity experience. He holds the following relevant qualifications:\n• BSc Information Technology\n• CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional)\n• CISM (Certified Information Security Manager)\n• CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)\nFor details of the CTO’s experience, please see “Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees — Senior\nManagement”.\nRisks from Material Cybersecurity Threats\nDuring fiscal year 2024, the Company reported no material cybersecurity incidents affecting the confidentiality,\nintegrity, or availability of data or systems. There are no identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, that have\nmaterially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including its operations, business strategy,\nresults of operations, or financial condition.

We also have audited the Group’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Group as of March 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years\nthen ended in conformity with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board\nand International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union. Also in our opinion, the\nGroup maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024, based\non criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Group's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,\nincluded in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 15. Our\nresponsibility is to express opinions on the Group’s consolidated financial statements and on the Group's internal control\nover financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Group in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was\nmaintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating\nthe design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included\nperforming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide\na reasonable basis for our opinions.\nF-1\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on\nthe financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates\nto accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way\nour opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical\naudit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which\nit relates.\nAircraft component- estimated useful lives and expected residual values\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, at March 31, 2024, the Group had €10.85 billion of\nproperty, plant and equipment long-lived assets, of which €10.61 billion were aircraft related. In estimating the useful\nlives and expected residual values of the aircraft component, the Group considered a number of factors, including its\nown historic experience and past practices of aircraft disposals, renewal programmes, forecasted growth plans, external\nvaluations from independent appraisers, recommendations from the aircraft supplier and manufacturer and other\nindustry-available information. The Group's estimate of each aircraft’s residual value is 15% of the market value on\ndelivery, based on independent valuations and actual aircraft disposals during prior periods. Each aircraft’s useful life is\ndetermined to be 23 years.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to Aircraft component- estimated\nuseful lives and expected residual values is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgement by management when\ndetermining the useful lives and residual values assumptions; and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgement, subjectivity\nand effort in performing procedures to evaluate management’s assessment of the estimated useful lives and expected\nresidual values assumptions.\nF-2\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to the assessment of the useful life and residual values. These procedures also included, among others,\nevaluating the reasonableness of the estimated useful lives and expected residual values assumptions. Evaluating\nmanagement’s assumptions related to useful life and residual values involved evaluating whether the assumptions used\nwere reasonable considering a) recommendations from the aircraft manufacturer, b) the age profile of the aircraft and\nthe Group’s aircraft renewal programme, c) third party valuations from an independent appraiser, and d) the Group’s own\nexperience of disposal of its aircraft. We also considered the published estimates of certain other international airlines.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers\nDublin, Ireland\nJune 26, 2024\nWe have served as the Group’s auditor since 2022.\nF-3\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors Ryanair Holdings plc:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Ryanair Holdings plc and subsidiaries (the\n’Company’) as of March 31, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in\nshareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year ended March 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the\nconsolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows\nfor the year ended March 31, 2022, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by\nthe International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and also IFRS as adopted by the European Union.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the\namounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nWe served as the Company’s auditor from 1985 to 2022.\nKPMG\nDublin, Ireland\nJuly 21, 2022\nNote that the report set out above

the consolidated financial statements.\nF-9\nNotes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n1. Basis of preparation and material accounting policies\nThe accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2024\nare set out below. These have been applied consistently for all periods presented, except as otherwise stated.\n(i) Business activity\nRyanair DAC and its subsidiaries (“Ryanair DAC”) has operated as an international airline since commencing\noperations in 1985. On August 23, 1996, Ryanair Holdings Limited, a newly formed holding company, acquired the entire\nissued share capital of Ryanair DAC. On May 16, 1997, Ryanair Holdings Limited re-registered as a public limited\ncompany, Ryanair Holdings plc (the “Company”). Ryanair Holdings plc and its subsidiaries are hereafter together referred\nto as “Ryanair Holdings plc” (or “we”, “our”, “us”, “Ryanair”, the “Company”, the “Ryanair Group”, or the “Group”) and\ncurrently operate a low-fares airline Group headquartered in Dublin Office, Airside Business Park, Swords, Dublin, Ireland.\nRyanair Holdings plc incorporated Buzz during the year ended March 31, 2018; it acquired Lauda and set up Ryanair UK\nduring the year ended March 31, 2019 and Malta Air during the year ended March 31, 2020. The principal trading activities\nof the Group are undertaken by Buzz, Lauda, Malta Air, Ryanair DAC and Ryanair UK.\n(ii) Statement of compliance\nIn accordance with the International Accounting Standards (“IAS”) Regulation (EC 1606 (2002)) which applies\nthroughout the European Union (“EU”), the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the EU (“IFRS as adopted by the EU”), which are\neffective for the year ended and as at March 31, 2024. In addition to complying with its legal obligation to comply with\nIFRS as adopted by the EU, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS\nAccounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) (“IFRS as issued by the\nIASB”). The consolidated financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2014.\nDetails of legislative changes and new accounting standards or amendments to accounting standards, which\nare not yet effective and have not been early adopted in these consolidated financial statements, and the likely impact\non future financial statements are set forth below in the prospective accounting changes section.\n(iii) Basis of preparation\nThese consolidated financial statements are presented in euro millions, the euro being the functional currency\nof the parent entity and the primary Group companies. They are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for\nderivative financial instruments, which are stated at fair value and share-based payments, which are based on fair value\ndetermined as at the grant date of the relevant share options.\nIn adopting the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements, the Directors have considered\nRyanair’s available sources of finance including access to the capital markets, sale and leaseback transactions, secured\ndebt structures, the Group’s cash on-hand and cash generation and preservation projections, together with factors likely\nto affect its future performance, as well as the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties.\nOil prices increased significantly following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and remain volatile in\nlight of the Israel-Hamas conflict. Geopolitical events, including the escalation or expansion of hostilities in Ukraine\nand/or the Middle East, may lead to further trade restrictions and instability across Europe and worldwide. This has\nresulted in price increases of goods and services globally that may affect Ryanair which has exposure, either directly or\nindirectly, to certain raw materials, including steel and titanium used for aircraft it purchases and jet fuel.\nF-10\nThe Directors have reviewed the financial forecasts across a range of scenarios. Ryanair has modeled a base\ncase assuming the Group achieves traffic of 200m guests in fiscal year 2025. However, there remains a risk of worsening\nconditions resulting from the invasion of Ukraine and/or the Israel-Hamas conflict. Accordingly, Ryanair has also\nmodeled downside scenarios that include combinations of a decrease in yield, worse than expected load factors and\nadverse variations in fuel price.\nAs at March 31, 2024, the Group had a strong liquidity position with cash of over €4.1bn and net cash of almost\n€1.4bn. This level of cash, together with available sources of finance, is sufficient to cover the Group’s projected cash\nrequirements for operating expenses, capital expenditure (primarily related to the acquisition of new aircraft),\nrepayments of indebtedness and payment of corporation tax liabilities as they fall due, within at least the next 12-month\nperiod. Furthermore, as at March 31, 2024, Ryanair has 556 unencumbered, owned aircraft (100% of its owned fleet) and\na BBB+ (stable outlook) credit rating from both S&P and Fitch Ratings.\nBased on the assessment of the adequacy of the financial forecasts, testing various scenarios and considering\nthe uncertainties described above, and available sources of finance outlined, the Directors have formed a judgement, at\nthe time of approving the financial statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group\nas a whole have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least twelve months from the\ndate of approval of the financial statements and that there were no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt\non the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in\npreparing the financial statements.\n(iv) New IFRS standards adopted during the year\nThe following new and amended standards, have been issued by the IASB, and have also been endorsed by the\nEU. These standards are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on April 1, 2023 and therefore were\napplied by the Group for the first time to the fiscal year 2024 consolidated financial statements:\n• Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single\nTransaction (effective on or after January 1, 2023).\n• Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Definition of Accounting\nEstimates (effective on or after January 1, 2023).\n• Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of\nAccounting policies (effective on or after January 1, 2023).\n• IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts; including amendments to IFRS 17 (effective on or after January 1, 2023).\n• Amendments to IFRS 17 Insurance contracts: Initial Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 – Comparative Information\n(effective on or after January 1, 2023).\n• Amendments to IAS 12 Income taxes: International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules (effective on or after\nJanuary 1, 2023).\nThe adoption of these new or amended standards did not have a material impact on the Group’s financial\nposition or results for the year ended March 31, 2024, and are not expected to have a material impact on financial periods\nthereafter.\nF-11\n(v) Prospective IFRS accounting changes, new standards and interpretations not yet effective\nThe following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted for the purposes of the\npreparation of future financial statements, where applicable. Those that are not, as of yet, EU endorsed are flagged.\nWhile under review, we do not anticipate that the adoption of the other new or revised standards and interpretations will\nhave a material impact on our financial position or results from operations.\n• Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current,\nClassification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current – Deferral of Effective Date, and Non-current Liabilities with\nCovenants (effective on or after January 1, 2024).\n• Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases: Lease Liability in a Sale & Leaseback (effective on or after January 1, 2024).\n• Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: Supplier Finance\nArrangements (effective on or after January 1, 2024).\n• Amendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates: Lack of Exchangeability (effective on\nor after January 1, 2025).*\n• IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (effective on or after January 1, 2027).*\n• IFRS 19 Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures (effective on or after January 1, 2027).*\n• Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments (Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS\n7) (effective on or after January 1, 2026).*\n*These standards or amendments to standards are not as of yet EU endorsed.\n(vi) Critical accounting policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates,\njudgements and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities,\nincome and expenses. These estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various\nother factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, and the results of such estimates form the basis of\ncarrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ\nmaterially from these estimates. These underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. A revision to an\naccounting estimate is recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period\nor in the period of the revision and future periods if these are also affected. Principal sources of estimation uncertainty\nhave been set forth below. Actual results may differ from estimates.\nCritical estimates\nLong-lived assets\nAt March 31, 2024, the Group had €10.85bn of property, plant and equipment long-lived assets, of which\n€10.61bn were aircraft related. In accounting for long-lived assets, the Group must make estimates about the expected\nuseful lives of the assets and the expected residual values of the assets.\nIn estimating the useful lives and expected residual values of the aircraft component, the Group considered a\nnumber of factors, including its own historic experience and past practices of aircraft disposals, renewal programmes,\nforecasted growth plans, external valuations from independent appraisers, recommendations from the aircraft supplier\nand manufacturer and other industry-available information.\nThe Group's estimate of each aircraft’s residual value is 15% of market value on delivery, based on independent\nvaluations and actual aircraft disposals during prior periods, and each aircraft’s useful life is determined to be 23 years.\nF-12\nRevisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to maintenance programmes, changes in utilisation\nof the aircraft, governmental regulations on ageing aircraft, changes in new aircraft technology, changes in governmental\nand environmental taxes, changes in new aircraft fuel efficiency and changing market prices for new and used aircraft\nof the same or similar types. The Group therefore evaluates its estimates and assumptions in each reporting period,\nand, when warranted, adjusts these assumptions. Any adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through\ndepreciation expense.\nCritical judgements\nIn the opinion of the Directors, the following significant judgements were exercised in the preparation of the\nfinancial statements:\nLong-lived assets\nOn acquisition a judgement is made to allocate an element of the cost of an acquired aircraft to the cost of\nmajor airframe and engine overhauls, reflecting its service potential and the maintenance condition of its engines and\nairframe. This cost, which can equate to a substantial element of the total aircraft cost, is amortised over the shorter of\nthe period to the next maintenance check (usually between 8 and 12 years) or the remaining useful life of the aircraft.\n(vii) Basis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Ryanair Holdings plc and its\nsubsidiary undertakings as of March 31, 2024. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by Ryanair. Control exists when\nRyanair is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect\nthose returns through its power over the investee.\nAll inter-company account balances and any unrealized income or expenses arising from intra-group\ntransactions have been eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n(viii) Summary of material accounting policies\nAccounting for subsidiaries\nSubsidiaries are all entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to (has\nrights to) variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power\nover the entity. The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the year are included in the consolidated income\nstatement from the date at which control of the entity was obtained. They continue to be included in the consolidated\nincome statement until control ceases.\nForeign currency translation\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group entities are measured using the currency of the\nprimary economic environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The consolidated financial\nstatements are presented in euro, which is the functional currency of the parent entity and primary Group entities.\nTransactions arising in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies at the rates of\nexchange in effect at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies\nare re-translated to euro at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies are translated to euro at foreign exchange rates in effect at the dates the transactions\nF-13\nwere affected. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognized in profit or loss, except for\ndifferences arising on qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognized in other comprehensive income.\nSegment reporting\nThe Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided to\nthe Group CEO, who is the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).\nThe Group comprises five separate airlines, Buzz, Lauda Europe (“Lauda”), Malta Air, Ryanair DAC and Ryanair\nUK (which is consolidated within Ryanair DAC). Ryanair DAC is reported as a separate segment as it exceeds the\napplicable quantitative thresholds for reporting purposes. Buzz, Malta Air and Lauda do not individually exceed the\nquantitative thresholds and accordingly are presented on an aggregate basis as they exhibit similar economic\ncharacteristics and their services, activities and operations are sufficiently similar in nature. The results of these\noperations are included as ‘Other Airlines.’\nThe CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the profit after tax of each airline for the\nreporting period. Resource allocation decisions for all airlines are based on airline performance for the relevant period,\nwith the objective in making these resource allocation decisions being to optimise consolidated financial results.\nIncome statement classification and presentation\nIndividual income statement captions have been presented on the face of the income statement, together with\nadditional line items, headings, and sub-totals, where it is determined that such presentation is relevant to an\nunderstanding of our financial performance, in accordance with IAS 1, “Presentation of Financial Statements”.\nExceptional items are those that in management’s judgment need to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size,\nnature or incidence to provide additional information either on a primary statement or in a footnote.\nExpenses are classified and presented in accordance with the nature-of-expenses method.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nItems of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost, which includes capitalized borrowing costs, less\naccumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable\nto the acquisition of the asset. Cost may also include transfers from other comprehensive income of any gain or loss\non qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment.\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets, which are assets\nthat necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, are capitalized, until such time as\nthe assets are substantially ready for their intended use. Investment income earned on the temporary investment of\nspecific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for\ncapitalization.\nF-14\nDepreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of assets on a straight-line\nbasis over their expected useful lives at the following annual rates:\nRate of\nDepreciation\nHangar and buildings 3.33 to 5 %\nPlant and equipment (excluding aircraft) 20 to 33.3 %\nFixtures and fittings 20 %\nMotor vehicles 33.3 %\nAircraft\nAn element of the cost of an acquired aircraft is attributed on acquisition to its service potential, reflecting the\nmaintenance condition of its engines and airframe. This cost, which can equate to a substantial element of the total\naircraft cost, is amortized over the shorter of the period to the next maintenance check (usually between 8 and 12 years\nfor Boeing 737 aircraft) or the remaining life of the aircraft. The costs of subsequent major airframe and engine\nmaintenance checks are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of the period to the next check or the estimated\nremaining life of the aircraft.\nThe remaining aircraft components are depreciated over their estimated useful lives to estimated residual\nvalues. The estimates of useful lives and residual values at year-end are:\nNumber of Owned Aircraft\nAircraft Type at March 31, 2024 Useful Life Residual Value\nBoeing 737s * 556 23 years from date of 15% of market value of new\nmanufacture aircraft on delivery, determined\nperiodically\n*Including 146 new Boeing 737-8200s\nThe Group’s estimate of each aircraft’s residual value is 15% of market value on delivery, based on independent\nvaluations and actual aircraft disposals during prior periods.\nAdvance and option payments in respect of aircraft purchase commitments and options to acquire aircraft are\nrecorded at cost and are initially recognized in Trade Payables prior to payment. On acquisition of the related aircraft,\nthese payments are included as part of the cost of aircraft and are depreciated from that date. Where the Company\nreceives reimbursements from the supplier in respect of aircraft purchases, they are reflected as a reduction in the cost\nof the asset.\nRotable spare parts held by the Company are classified as property, plant and equipment if they are expected to\nbe used over more than one period.\nGains and losses on disposal of items of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the\nproceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognized on a net basis\nwithin other income/(expense) in profit or loss.\nThe Group evaluates, at the end of each reporting period, whether there is any indication that its aircraft may be\nimpaired. Factors that may indicate potential impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the\nmarket value of an aircraft based on observable information, a significant change in an aircraft’s physical condition and\noperating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the aircraft.\nF-15\nAircraft maintenance costs\nThe accounting for the cost of providing major airframe and certain engine maintenance checks for owned\naircraft is described in the accounting policy for property, plant and equipment.\nFor aircraft held under lease agreements, Ryanair is contractually committed to either return the aircraft in a\ncertain condition or to compensate the lessor based on the actual condition of the airframe, engines and life-limited\nparts upon return. In order to fulfill such conditions of the lease, maintenance, in the form of major airframe overhaul,\nengine maintenance checks, and restitution of major life-limited parts, is required to be performed during the period of\nthe lease and upon return of the aircraft to the lessor. The estimated airframe and engine maintenance costs and the\ncosts associated with the restitution of major life-limited parts, are provided for over the lease term for this contractual\nobligation, based on the present value of the estimated future cost of the major airframe overhaul, engine maintenance\nchecks, and restitution of major life-limited parts, calculated by reference to the number of hours flown or cycles\noperated during the year. A portion of this provision is offset against the right of use asset, which is immediately\ndepreciated as the liability is incurred as the aircraft is flown. The remaining portion of the provision, relating to normal\nwear and tear, is charged directly to the income statement.\nAll other maintenance costs, other than major airframe overhaul, engine maintenance checks, and restitution of\nmajor life-limited parts costs associated with leased aircraft, are expensed as incurred.\nIntangible assets - landing rights\nIntangible assets acquired are recognized to the extent it is considered probable that expected future benefits\nwill flow to the Company and the associated costs can be measured reliably. Landing rights acquired as part of a\nbusiness combination are capitalized at fair value at that date and are not amortized, where those rights are considered\nto be indefinite. The carrying values of those rights are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date and are subject\nto impairment testing when events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable.\nNo impairment to the carrying values of the Company’s intangible assets has been recorded to date.\nFinancial assets: cash > 3 months\nOther financial assets comprise cash deposits of greater than three months’ maturity at commencement. All\namounts are categorized as amortized cost and are recognized initially at fair value and then subsequently are measured\nat amortized cost, using the effective interest method in the balance sheet.\nDerivative financial instruments\nThe Group uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to market risks, including the\nrisks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices and currency exchange rates. Ryanair uses forward swap contracts\nand options for the purchase of its jet fuel (jet kerosene) and forward contracts for carbon credit (Emission Trading\nScheme) requirements to reduce its exposure to commodity price risk. It also uses foreign currency forward contracts\nto reduce its exposure to risks related to foreign currencies, principally the U.S. dollar exposure associated with the\npurchase of new Boeing 737-8200 aircraft and the U.S. dollar exposure associated with the purchase of jet fuel.\nThe Group’s derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value and recognised as either assets or\nliabilities in its consolidated balance sheet.\nAll derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges on inception. With the exception of the time value of jet fuel\ncall options, all gains and losses are taken to other reserves. The time value of jet fuel call options is excluded from the\ndesignated hedging instrument, with movements in time value recognised in the income statement. At March 31, 2024,\nF-16\na net asset of €144m (2023: net asset of €231m) was recognised on balance sheet in respect of the Group’s foreign\ncurrency derivative instruments associated with future jet fuel purchases and aircraft additions, and a net asset of €27m\n(2023: net liability of €286m) was recognised in respect of its commodity derivative instruments associated with fuel\nand carbon operating expenses.\nIn determining the hedge effectiveness of derivative instruments used to hedge Ryanair’s fuel requirements,\nthere is significant judgement involved in assessing whether the volumes of jet fuel hedged are still expected to be highly\nprobable forecast transactions. Specifically, significant judgement is required in respect of the assumptions related to\nthe future number of sectors and sector length. All of these assumptions impact upon forecast fuel consumption, and\nchanges to these assumptions could have a significant effect on the assessment of hedge effectiveness.\nIn respect of foreign currency hedge effectiveness for future aircraft purchases, there is a high degree of\njudgement involved in assessing whether the future aircraft payments are still considered highly probable of occurring,\nand the timing of these future payments for aircraft. The timing of future payments for aircraft is dependent on the\naircraft manufacturer’s ability to meet forecast aircraft delivery schedules.\nAs at March 31, 2024 the Group had entered into jet fuel forward swap contracts covering approximately 70%\nof its estimated requirements for fiscal year 2025. The Group believes these hedges to be effective for hedge accounting\npurposes.\nTrade and other receivables and payables\nTrade and other receivables and payables are stated on initial recognition at fair value plus any incremental\ndirect costs and subsequently at amortized cost, net (in the case of receivables) of any impairment losses, which\napproximates fair value given the short-dated nature of these assets and liabilities.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash represents cash held at banks and available on demand and is categorized for measurement purposes as\namortized cost.\nCash equivalents are current asset investments (other than cash) that are readily convertible into known\namounts of cash, typically cash deposits of more than one day but less than three months at the date of purchase, and\nmoney market funds. Deposits with maturities greater than three months but less than one year are recognized as short-\nterm investments, are measured at amortized cost and are carried initially at fair value and then subsequently at\namortized cost, using the effective-interest method.\nF-17\nEU Emissions Trading System and UK Emissions Trading Scheme (“ETS”)\nThe EU Emissions Trading System and UK Emissions Trading Scheme (“ETS”), are cap-and-trade systems for\nCO2 emissions to encourage industries to improve their CO2 efficiency. On an annual basis, the Group surrenders\nallowances, received via a mixture of free allocations from governing bodies and carbon credits purchased in the\nexternal market, to cover carbon emissions. The Group recognizes the cost associated with the purchase of carbon\ncredits as part of the ETS as an expense in the income statement within ‘Operating expenses – fuel and oil’. This expense\nis recognized in line with fuel consumed during the fiscal year as the Group’s carbon emissions and fuel consumptions\nare directly linked.\nETS allowances are recognized and measured at cost, as follows:\na) Allowances received from governing bodies for free – a nil amount is recognized.\nb) Carbon credits purchased in the external market – are recognized at their purchase price as a\nprepayment and are presented within ‘Other assets’ on the Group’s balance sheet.\nA liability is recognized when carbon emissions produced exceed the allowances received from governing\nbodies. These excess emissions produced by the Group are measured at fair value, reflecting the expenditure required\nto settle the present obligation at the reporting date. The liability is presented within ‘Accrued expenses and other\nliabilities’ on the Group’s balance sheet.\nIn the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, ETS allowances purchased are reflected within operating\nactivities as an increase in other assets.\nAs noted on pages F-37 and F-38, the Group’s fuel risk management policy includes hedging of ETS exposures.\nThe Group had purchased sufficient carbon credits to satisfy the fiscal year 2024 emissions and as such, the cost of\nemissions is not deemed to represent a major source of estimation uncertainty.\nInterest-bearing loans and borrowings\nAll loans and borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, being the fair value of the consideration received, net\nof attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, non-current interest-bearing loans are measured at\namortized cost, using the effective interest rate methodology.\nLeases\nAt inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or\ncontains a lease, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange\nfor consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group\nuses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16.\nRight of use assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future lease payments\nover the lease term at commencement date. In determining the net present value of lease payments, the Group uses its\nincremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date. The right of use asset is\ninitially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at\nor before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred.\nF-18\nThe Group recognizes a depreciation charge for right of use assets on a straight-line basis over the lease term\nwithin depreciation expenses, and an interest expense on lease liabilities within finance expenses in the Group’s\nconsolidated income statement. In addition, the right of use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any,\nand adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\nThe lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The interest rate implicit\nin the lease cannot be readily determined, and therefore the incremental borrowing rate of the Group has been used. The\nincremental borrowing rate is determined by reference to the borrowing rate the Group would be offered if it took out a\nsecuritized loan from a third-party financial institution for a similar amount and similar period. It is remeasured when\nthere is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, or if there is a change in the Group’s\nestimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment\nof whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option, if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease\npayment or if there is a contract modification. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding\nadjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right of use asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount\nof the right of use asset has been reduced to zero.\nThe Group has lease agreements for aircraft with lease and non-lease components, which the Group has elected\nto account for as a single lease component.\nThe Group has elected to take the short-term lease exemption and, therefore, does not recognize a right of use\nasset or corresponding liability for lease arrangements with an original term of 12 months or less. Lease payments\nassociated with short-term leases are recognized in the Group’s consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis\nover the lease term.\nThe Group has elected to take the low value lease exemption and, therefore, does not recognize a right of use\nasset or corresponding liability for lease arrangements for which the underlying value is of low value. Lease payments\nassociated with these leases are recognized in the Group’s consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over\nthe lease term.\nProvisions and contingencies\nA provision is recognized in the balance sheet when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result\nof a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation. If the\neffect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future outflow at a pre-tax rate that reflects\ncurrent market assessments of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.\nThe Group assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to contingencies, as well as probable losses. We\nrecord provisions for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss\ncan be reasonably estimated. A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of the obligation will only be\nconfirmed by future events, or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability.\nProvisions are re-measured at each reporting date based on the best estimate of the settlement amount.\nRevenues\nScheduled revenues relate to the sale of flight seats and associated direct flight fees, including baggage fares\nand change fees. Scheduled revenues are measured at the amount paid by the passenger, net of taxes, and recognized\nwithin unearned revenue at the time of booking. Scheduled revenues are recognized within the income statement at the\npoint in time when the flight service is provided (i.e. when the flight takes place).\nF-19\nAncillary revenues relate to activities connected with the flight service, including priority boarding, allocated\nseating and in-flight sales of merchandise. These services are recognized when the performance obligations have been\nsatisfied which, as the majority of the ancillary services are related to passenger flight travel, is at the point in time when\nthe flight service is provided.\nThe Group has determined it is an agent in relation to associated flight services including car hire, travel\ninsurance, accommodation, airport transfer and parking and airport fast track services as the obligation is to arrange\nfor the services to be provided by a third party and therefore revenue is mainly recognized at the point in time when the\nservice is arranged. This is predominately at the time of booking by the passenger.\nWhere a flight is cancelled, a passenger is entitled to a cash refund, a voucher for a future flight, or to re-schedule\nthe cancelled flight. Additionally, gift vouchers may be purchased by passengers. Where a voucher is issued, a liability\nfor the amount paid by the passenger is recognized in full and held within unearned revenue until the voucher is utilized\nagainst a future flight, when it expires, or when it is probable that it will expire unexercised.\nAccordingly, unearned revenue, which is presented as a contract liability within the balance sheet, represents\nflight seats sold but not yet flown and where a voucher for a future flight has been issued. Unearned revenue is included\nin accrued expenses and other liabilities.\nWhere the Group expects to refund some, or all, of the amount paid for a flight service, for instance where a\nflight is cancelled, a refund liability is recognized for the full amount payable. This is recognized within unearned revenue\nand included in accrued expenses and other liabilities.\nShare-based payments\nThe Company engages in equity-settled, share-based payment transactions in respect of services received from\ncertain employees as part of the Option Plan 2013 and the LTIP 2019 (collectively “equity settled transactions”). The fair\nvalue of the services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity settled transactions on the date of\nthe grant. The grant measurement date is the date that a shared understanding of the terms of the award is established\nbetween the Company and the employee. The cost of the employee services received in respect of the equity settled\ntransactions granted is recognized in the income statement over the period that the services are received, which is the\nvesting period, with a corresponding increase in equity. To the extent that service is provided prior to the grant\nmeasurement date, the fair value of the equity settled transaction is initially estimated and re-measured at each reporting\ndate until the grant measurement date is achieved. The fair value of the market conditions related to equity settled\ntransactions granted is determined using a binomial lattice option-pricing model, which takes into account the exercise\nprice of the equity settled transactions, the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the\nRyanair Holdings plc share price over the life of the equity settled transaction, employee early exercise behavior and\nother relevant factors. Non-market vesting conditions are included in the assumptions about the number of equity\nsettled transactions that are expected to vest. At each reporting date, the Company revises its estimates of the number\nof options/conditional shares that are likely to vest as a result of non-market conditions. Where the share-based\npayments give rise to the issue of new share capital, the proceeds received by the Company are credited to share capital\n(nominal value) and share premium (where applicable) when the share entitlements are exercised.\nThe Group recognizes the effect of modifications that increase the total fair value of the share-based payment\narrangement. The incremental fair value granted is included in the measurement of the amount recognized for services\nreceived over the period from the modification date until the date when the modified equity-settled share-based\npayments transactions vest.\nF-20\nGovernment grants\nGrants that compensate the Company for related expenses incurred are recognized in the income statement on\na systematic basis in the periods in which the related expenses are recognized in staff costs.\nDuring recent years, many European countries in which the Ryanair Group operates made available payroll\nsupport schemes. The Ryanair Group utilized a number of these employment retention schemes to protect jobs within\nthe Group. These schemes were a mix of short term Covid-19 specific programs and long term schemes linked to social\nsecurity that existed pre Covid-19. The total amount of payroll supports received by the Group under the various schemes\namounted to €nil in fiscal year 2024 (2023: €nil; 2022: €82m) and are offset against staff costs in the consolidated\nincome statement. Such supports wound down significantly in the second half of fiscal year 2022.\nIn April 2020, the Group raised £600m unsecured debt for general corporate purposes under the HMT and Bank\nof England CCFF. The 0.44% interest rate was the prevailing rate for strong BBB rated companies. This debt was\nextended in March 2021 for a further 12 months at a 0.46% interest rate. In October 2021 the Group repaid the £600m\nHMT and Bank of England CCFF in full. There are no unfulfilled conditions attaching to government assistance at March\n31, 2024.\nTaxation\nIncome tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognized in the income\nstatement except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity or other comprehensive income\n(“OCI”). The Group has determined that the interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax treatments do not\nmeet the definition of income taxes, and therefore accounted for them under IAS 37 - Provisions, Contingent Liabilities\nand Contingent Assets.\nCurrent Tax\nCurrent tax comprises the expected tax payable and receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and\nany adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payable or\nreceivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to\nincome taxes, if any. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Current tax\nalso includes any tax arising from dividends. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.\nDeferred Tax\nDeferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising from the tax bases\nof assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income tax is\ndetermined using tax rates and legislation enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and expected to apply\nwhen the temporary differences reverse. Deferred income tax is not recognized in relation to tax laws that implement\nthe Pillar Two model rules published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, including tax law\nthat implements qualified domestic minimum top-up taxes under those rules.\nThe following temporary differences are not provided for: (i) the initial recognition of assets and liabilities that\neffect neither accounting nor taxable profit and (ii) differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that\nit is probable they will not reverse in the future.\nA deferred tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available\nagainst which temporary differences can be utilized. The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each\nF-21\nreporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that a sufficient taxable profit will be available to\nallow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be realized.\nTax liabilities are based on the best estimate of the likely obligation at each reporting period. These estimates\nare subject to revision based on the outcome of tax audits and discussions with revenue authorities that can take several\nyears to conclude.\nSocial insurance, passenger taxes and sales taxes\nSocial insurance, passenger taxes and sales taxes are recorded as a liability based on laws enacted in the\njurisdictions to which they relate. Liabilities are recorded when an obligation has been incurred.\nShare capital\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of ordinary\nshares and share options are recognized as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects. When share capital\nrecognized as equity is repurchased, the amount of consideration paid, which includes any directly attributable costs,\nnet of any tax effects, is recognized as a deduction from equity.

The Company also considers that there has been no impairment of\nthe value of these rights to date. The recoverable amount of these rights has been determined on a value-in-use basis,\nusing discounted cash flow projections for a twenty year period for each route that has an individual landing right. The\ncalculation of value-in-use is most sensitive to the operating margin and discount rate assumptions. Operating margins\nare based on the existing margins generated from these routes and adjusted for any known trading conditions. The\ntrading environment is subject to both regulatory and competitive pressures that can have a material effect on the\noperating performance of the business. Foreseeable events, however, are unlikely to result in a change of projections of\na significant nature so as to result in the landing rights’ carrying amounts exceeding their recoverable amounts. These\nprojections have been discounted based on the estimated discount rate applicable to the asset of 11% for 2024, 13.4%\nfor 2023 and 11.2% for 2022.\n5.

Financial instruments – Fair values and risk management\nThe Company utilizes financial instruments to reduce exposures to market risks throughout its business.\nBorrowings, cash and cash equivalents and liquid investments are used to finance the Company’s operations. The\nCompany uses derivative financial instruments, principally jet fuel derivatives, options and forward foreign exchange\ncontracts to manage commodity risks, interest rate risks and currency exposures and to achieve the desired profile of\nfixed and variable rate borrowings and leases in appropriate currencies. It is the Company’s policy that no speculative\ntrading in financial instruments shall take place.\nThe main risks attaching to the Company’s financial instruments, the Company’s strategy and approach to\nmanaging these risks, and the details of the derivatives employed to hedge against these risks have been disclosed in\nthis note.\n(a) Accounting classifications and fair values\nThe following tables show the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities, by\nclass and category, as at March 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorized by the type of valuation\nmethod used.\nThe different valuation levels are defined as follows:\n• Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can\naccess at the measurement date.\n• Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for that asset or liability,\neither directly or indirectly.\n• Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nThe following paragraphs describe the valuation techniques used in measuring Level 2 fair values for each\nmaterial class of financial instruments in the consolidated balance sheet, as well as the significant unobservable inputs\nused.\nFinancial instruments measured at fair value\nDerivatives – interest rate swaps: Discounted cash flow analyses have been used to determine their fair value,\ntaking into account current market inputs and rates. The Group’s credit risk and counterparty’s credit risk is taken into\naccount when establishing fair value (Level 2).\nDerivatives – currency forwards, jet fuel forward swap contracts and carbon contracts: A comparison of the\ncontracted rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at March 31, 2024 has been used to\nestablish fair value. The Group’s credit risk and counterparty’s credit risk is taken into account when establishing fair\nvalue (Level 2).\nDerivatives – jet fuel call options: The fair value of jet fuel call options is determined based on standard option\npricing valuation models (Level 2).\nFinancial instruments not measured at fair value\nLong-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been discounted at the relevant\nmarket rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at the relevant reporting year end date to arrive at a fair\nvalue representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.\nTrade payables: The value of trade payables has not been discounted as the effects of discounting would not\nbe material.\nF-31\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\n€M €M €M €M\nAt March 31, 2024\nDerivative assets measured at fair value for risk management purposes\nU.S. dollar currency forward contracts — 147.2 — 147.2\nJet fuel & carbon derivative contracts — 205.6 — 205.6\n— 352.8 — 352.8\nDerivative liabilities measured at fair value for risk management purposes\nU.S. currency forward contracts — 3.3 — 3.3\nJet fuel & carbon derivative contracts — 178.8 — 178.8\n— 182.1 — 182.1\nFinancial liabilities not measured at fair value\nDebt — 2,510.3 — 2,510.3\nNon-current trade payables — — — —\n— 2,510.3 — 2,510.3\nTotal — 3,045.2 — 3,045.2\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\n€M €M €M €M\nAt March 31, 2023\nDerivative assets measured at fair value for risk management purposes\nU.S. dollar currency forward contracts — 279.4 — 279.4\nCross-currency swaps — 3.6 — 3.6\nJet fuel & carbon derivative contracts — 63.7 — 63.7\n— 346.7 — 346.7\nDerivative liabilities measured at fair value for risk management purposes\nU.S. currency forward contracts — 48.0 — 48.0\nJet fuel & carbon derivative contracts — 349.8 — 349.8\n— 397.8 — 397.8\nFinancial liabilities not measured at fair value\nDebt — 3,792.4 — 3,792.4\nNon-current trade payables — — — —\n— 3,792.4 — 3,792.4\n— 4,536.9 — 4,536.9\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\n€M €M €M €M\nAt March 31, 2022\nDerivative assets measured at fair value for risk management purposes\nU.S. dollar currency forward contracts — 474.1 — 474.1\nJet fuel derivative contracts — 1,106.8 — 1,106.8\nCross-currency swaps — 4.6 — 4.6\n— 1,585.5 — 1,585.5\nDerivative liabilities measured at fair value for risk management purposes\nU.S. currency forward contracts — 31.0 — 31.0\nJet fuel derivative contracts — 7.6 — 7.6\n— 38.6 — 38.6\nFinancial liabilities not measured at fair value\nDebt — 4,952.2 — 4,952.2\nNon-current trade payables — 49.2 — 49.2\n— 5,001.4 — 5,001.4\nTotal — 6,625.5 — 6,625.5\nF-32\nTransfers between Levels 1 and 2 and transfers out of Level 3\nDuring the years ended March 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2\nfair-value measurements, and no transfers into or out of Level 3 fair-value measurement.\n(c) Financial risk management\nRisk management framework\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has responsibility for monitoring the treasury policies and\nprocedures of the Group, which include controls over the procedures used to manage the main financial risks arising\nfrom the Group’s operations. Such risks comprise market risks including commodity price, foreign exchange and interest\nrate risks, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure\nto market risks, including the risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices and currency exchange rates. Ryanair\nuses forward swap contracts and call options for the purchase of its jet fuel (jet kerosene) and carbon credit (Emission\nTrading System) requirements to reduce its exposure to commodity price risk. It also uses foreign currency forward\ncontracts to reduce its exposure to risks related to foreign currencies, principally the U.S. dollar exposure associated\nwith the purchase of new Boeing 737 aircraft and the U.S. dollar exposure associated with the purchase of jet fuel. At\nMarch 31, 2024 all derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. With the exception of the time value of jet fuel call\noptions, all gains and losses are taken to other reserves. The time value of jet fuel call options is excluded from the\ndesignated hedging instrument, with movements in time value recognized in the income statement.\nMarket risk\nRyanair is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and currency\nexchange rates. The objective of financial risk management at Ryanair is to minimize the impact of commodity price,\ninterest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the Company’s earnings, cash flows and equity.\nThe Group uses derivatives to manage market risks. All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines\nset by the Audit Committee. Generally, the Group seeks to apply hedge accounting to manage volatility in profit or loss.\nCurrency risk\nThe Group is exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that there is a mismatch between the currencies in\nwhich sales, purchases, receivables and borrowings are denominated and the respective functional currencies of Group\ncompanies. The functional currencies of Group companies is the euro. The main currencies in which non-euro\ntransactions occur giving rise to foreign currency risk are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and UK pounds sterling.\nThe Company manages this risk by typically matching UK pounds sterling revenues against UK pounds sterling\ncosts. Surplus UK pounds sterling revenues are sometimes used to fund forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge\nU.S. dollar currency exposures that arise in relation to fuel, maintenance, aviation insurance, and capital expenditure\ncosts and typically UK pounds sterling are converted into euro. Additionally, the Group swaps euro for U.S. dollars using\nforward currency contracts to cover any expected U.S. dollar outflows for these costs. From time to time, the Company\nalso swaps UK pounds sterling for euro using forward currency contracts to hedge expected future surplus UK pounds\nsterling. From time to time the Group also enters into cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge against fluctuations\nin foreign exchange rates and interest rates in respect of U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.\nF-33\nForward currency contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted U.S. dollar payments and have\nbeen determined to be highly effective in offsetting variability in future cash flows arising from the fluctuation in the U.S.\ndollar and euro exchange rates for the forecasted U.S. dollar purchases.\nIn these hedge relationships, the main sources of ineffectiveness are changes in the timing of the hedged\ntransactions. The Group recorded a hedge ineffectiveness loss of €nil on ineffective currency cash flow hedges for fiscal\nyear 2024 (2023: €nil, 2022: €nil).\nExposure to currency risk\nThe summary quantitative data about the Group’s exposure to currency risk as reported to the management of\nthe Group is as follows:\nAt March 31 ,\n2024 2023 2022\nGBP U.S.$ Euro € GBP U.S.$ Euro € GBP U.S.$ Euro €\n£M $M €M £M $M €M £M $M €M\nMonetary assets\nUK pounds sterling cash and liquid resources 55.6 — 65.1 78.1 — 88.8 28.3 — 33.6\nU.S. Dollar cash and liquid resources — 785.5 727.8 — 671.3 619.3 — 386.8 349.6\n55.6 785.5 792.9 78.1 671.3 708.1 28.3 386.8 383.2\nAt March 31 ,\n2024 2023 2022\nGBP U.S.$ Euro € GBP U.S.$ Euro € GBP U.S.$ Euro €\n£M $M €M £M $M €M £M $M €M\nMonetary liabilities\nU.S. dollar long term debt* — — — — 280.8 259.1 — 311.3 281.3\nPre-delivery payments due to Boeing — — — — 669.2 617.4 — 296.2 267.7\n— — — — 950.0 876.5 — 607.5 549.0\n*During the year ended March 31, 2022, the Group issued non-interest-bearing promissory notes to the value of\napproximately €230m (U.S.$250m) in settlement of certain aircraft trade payables.

As at March 31,\n2024 the hedged U.S. dollar rate was approximately U.S.$1.12 to €1.00.\nSensitivity analysis\nIf the rate fell by 10% outstanding foreign currency-denominated financial assets and financial liabilities at\nMarch 31, 2024 would have a positive impact of €77m on the income statement (net of tax) (2023: €46m; 2022: €26m)\nand a negative impact of €63m on the income statement (net of tax) (2023: €38m; 2022: €2m) if the rate increased by\n10%. The same movement of 10% in foreign currency exchange rates would have a positive €501m impact (net of tax)\non equity if the rate fell by 10% and a negative €410m impact (net of tax) if the rate increased by 10% (2023: €677m\npositive or €544m negative; 2022: €695m positive or €588m negative).\nInterest rate risk\nThe Group’s objective for interest rate risk management is to reduce interest-rate risk by matching a proportion\nof floating rate assets with floating rate liabilities, and using financial instruments, which lock in interest rates on debt,\nwhen appropriate. Floating interest rates on financial liabilities are referenced to European interbank interest rates\n(EURIBOR). Secured long-term debt and interest rate swaps typically re-price on a quarterly basis. The Group uses current\ninterest rate settings on existing floating rate debt at each year-end to calculate contractual cash flows. Fixed interest\nrates on financial liabilities are fixed for the duration of the underlying structures.\nIn previous years the Group utilized cross currency interest rate swaps to manage exposures to fluctuations in\nforeign exchange rates of U.S. dollar denominated floating rate borrowings, together with managing the exposures to\nfluctuations in interest rates on these U.S. dollar denominated floating rate borrowings. Cross currency interest rate\nswaps were primarily used to convert a portion of the Group’s U.S. dollar denominated debt to euro and floating rate\ninterest exposures into fixed rate exposures and are set so as to match exactly the critical terms of the underlying debt\nbeing hedged (i.e. notional principal, interest rate settings, re-pricing dates). These were all designated in cash flow\nhedges of the forecasted U.S. dollar variable interest payments on the Group’s underlying debt and were determined to\nbe highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows. Accordingly, no ineffectiveness was recorded in the income\nstatement relating to these hedges.\nF-35\nExposures to interest rate risk\nThe following was the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities (excluding aircraft provisions, trade\npayables and accrued expenses).\nWeighted\naverage 2029 -\nrate 2025 2026 2027 2028 2031 Total\nAt March 31, 2024 (%) €M €M €M €M €M €M\nFixed rate\nSecured debt\nUnsecured debt 1.67% 50.0 843.4 1,198.8 — — 2,092.2\nDebt 1.67% 50.0 843.4 1,198.8 — — 2,092.2\nLease liabilities - right of use 4.43% 39.4 31.9 32.1 32.7 28.5 164.6\nTotal fixed rate debt 89.4 875.3 1,230.9 32.7 28.5 2,256.8\nFloating rate\nUnsecured long term debt 4.30% — — — — 490.0 490.0\nTotal floating rate debt 4.30% — — — — 490.0 490.0\nTotal financial liabilities 89.4 875.3 1,230.9 32.7 518.5 2,746.8\nWeighted\naverage 2028 -\nrate 2024 2025 2026 2027 2031 Total\nAt March 31, 2023 (%) €M €M €M €M €M €M\nFixed rate\nSecured debt 2.43% 16.2 12.3 — — — 28.5\nUnsecured debt 1.39% 1,040.5 * 46.0 846.1 1,198.8 — 3,131.4\nDebt 1.39% 1,056.7 58.3 846.1 1,198.8 — 3,159.9\nLease liabilities - right of use 4.37% 43.2 38.4 31.8 32.2 60.7 206.3\nTotal fixed rate debt 1,099.9 96.7 877.9 1,231.0 60.7 3,366.2\nFloating rate\nUnsecured long term debt 3.45% — 750.0 ** — — — 750.0\nTotal floating rate debt 3.45% — 750.0 — — — 750.0\nTotal financial liabilities 1,099.9 846.7 877.9 1,231.0 60.7 4,116.2\n* Includes promissory notes amounting to approx. €230m\n** Refinanced post year end (May 2023) with unsecured RCF at lower margin maturing May 2028\nWeighted\naverage 2027 -\nrate 2023 2024 2025 2026 2028 Total\nAt March 31, 2022 (%) €M €M €M €M €M €M\nFixed rate\nSecured debt 2.43% 62.9 52.2 12.0 — — 127.1\nUnsecured debt 1.31% 1,140.9 * 807.7 47.8 847.0 1,197.9 4,041.3\nDebt 1.35% 1,203.8 859.9 59.8 847.0 1,197.9 4,168.4\nLease liabilities - right of use 2.33% 56.9 51.0 26.2 3.1 1.1 138.3\nTotal fixed rate debt 1,260.7 910.9 86.0 850.1 1,199.0 4,306.7\nFloating rate\nSecured long term debt 0.14% 20.7 — — — — 20.7\nUnsecured long term debt 0.75% — — 750.0 — — 750.0\nTotal floating rate debt 0.73% 20.7 — 750.0 — — 770.7\nTotal financial liabilities 1,281.4 910.9 836.0 850.1 1,199.0 5,077.4\n* Includes promissory notes amounting to approx. €226m\nF-36\nThe Group holds significant cash balances that are invested on a short-term basis.

This policy was adopted to prevent the\nGroup being exposed, in the short term, to adverse movements in global jet fuel prices. However, when deemed to be in\nthe best interests of the Group, the Group does not necessarily hedge up to this limit. At March 31, 2024, the Group had\nentered into forward hedging covering approximately 70% of the Group’s estimated fuel exposure for fiscal year 2025.\nThe Group utilizes jet fuel forward swap contracts and jet fuel call options to manage exposure to jet fuel prices.\nThese are used to hedge the Group’s forecasted fuel purchases and are arranged so as to match as closely as possible\nagainst forecasted fuel delivery and payment requirements. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of\nforecasted fuel payments and have been determined to be highly effective in offsetting variability in future cash flows\narising from fluctuations in jet fuel prices.\nThe Group has entered into jet fuel forward swap contracts with a number of counterparties to hedge jet fuel\npurchases over a period of up to 18 to 24 months. The notional amount of these contracts are €2.7bn (2023: €3.3bn;\n2022: €1.8bn) at an average hedged rate of approximately U.S.$795 per metric tonne. (2023: U.S.$885; 2022: U.S.$640).\nF-37\nIn these hedging relationships the main sources of ineffectiveness are changes in the timing of the hedged\ntransactions. The Group recorded a hedge ineffectiveness charge of €nil in fiscal year 2024 (2023: €nil, 2022: €nil,) in\nrelation to jet fuel hedges (€nil in relation to jet fuel swaps, and €nil in relation currency forward contracts).\nThe European Union Emissions Trading System (“EU-ETS”) is applicable to airlines from January 1, 2012. Ryanair\nrecognizes the cost associated with the purchase of carbon credits as part of the EU-ETS as an expense in the income\nstatement. This expense is recognized in line with fuel consumed during the fiscal year as the Group’s carbon emissions\nand fuel consumptions are directly linked.\nThe Group’s fuel risk management policy includes hedging of the Group’s EU-ETS and UK-ETS (carbon)\nexposures. This policy was adopted to prevent the Group being exposed, in the short term, to adverse movements in\ncarbon credit prices. However, when deemed to be in the best interests of the Group, it may deviate from this policy. At\nMarch 31, 2024, the Group had hedged approximately 100% of the Group’s estimated carbon exposure for fiscal year\n2025 at approximately €76 per EUA (2023: fiscal year 2024 was 54% hedged at €75 per EUA) and £66 per UKA (2023:\n£72) and approximately 28% for fiscal year 2026 at approximately €58 per EUA and £50 per UKA.\nSensitivity Analysis\nA plus or minus change of 10% in the price of jet fuel at March 31, 2024 would have a €nil impact (2023: €7m\ndecrease) on the income statement (net of tax) if the price fell by 10% and a €nil impact (2023: €4m increase) if the price\nincreased by 10%. The same movement of 10% in the price of jet fuel at March 31, 2024 would have a negative €254m\nimpact (2023: negative €258m) on equity if the price fell by 10% and a positive €254m impact (2023: positive €258m) if\nthe price increased by 10%.\nA plus or minus change of 10% in the price of carbon at March 31, 2024 would have a €nil impact (2023: €nil)\non the income statement (net of tax) if the price fell by 10% and a €nil impact (2023: €nil) if the price increased by 10%.\nThe same movement of 10% in the price of carbon at March 31, 2024 would have a negative €74m impact (2023:\nnegative €32m) on equity if the price fell by 10% and a positive €72m impact (2023: positive €32m) if the price increased\nby 10%.\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails\nto meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, derivatives\nand guarantees.\nTrade receivables\nThe Group’s revenues derive principally from airline travel on scheduled services, internet income and in-flight\nand related sales. Revenue is primarily derived from European routes. No individual customer accounts for a significant\nportion of total revenue.\nAt March 31, 2024, €13m (2023: €5m; 2022: €4m) of the accounts receivable balance were past due, of which\n€nil (2023: €nil; 2022: €nil) was impaired and €13m (2023: €5m; 2022: €4m) was considered past due but not impaired\nfor which the expected credit loss was considered immaterial.\nF-38\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Group holds significant cash balances, which are classified as either cash and cash equivalents or financial\nassets >3 months. These deposits and other financial instruments (principally certain derivatives and loans as identified\nabove) give rise to credit risk on amounts due from counterparties. Credit risk is managed by limiting the aggregate\namount and duration of exposure to any one counterparty through regular review of counterparties’ market-based\nratings, Tier 1 capital level and credit default swap rates and by taking into account bank counterparties’ systemic\nimportance to the financial systems of their home countries. The Group limits the concentration of risk in relation to any\none institution for cash and cash equivalents. Deposits are entered into with parties that have high investment grade\ncredit ratings from the main rating agencies, including Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”), Moody’s and Fitch ratings. The Group\nalso monitors where counterparty credit default swaps are trading. The maximum exposure arising in the event of\ndefault on the part of the counterparty is the carrying value of the relevant financial instrument. The Group is authorized\nto place funds on deposit for periods up to 18 months.\nDerivatives\nIn line with the Group’s policies and procedures, derivatives are entered into with parties that have high\ninvestment grade credit ratings from the main rating agencies, including Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”), Moody’s and Fitch\nratings. The Group also avoids concentration of risk in relation to derivative counterparties.\nGuarantees\nAt March 31, 2024, the Group has provided approximately €2.76bn (2023: €4.12bn; 2022: €5.09bn) in letters of\nguarantee to secure obligations of subsidiary undertakings in respect of loans, bank advances and long dated foreign\ncurrency transactions.\nIn order to avail itself of the exemption contained in Section 357 of the Companies Act, 2014, the holding\ncompany, Ryanair Holdings plc, has guaranteed the liabilities and commitments of its subsidiary undertakings registered\nin Ireland. As a result, the subsidiary undertakings have been exempted from the requirement to annex their statutory\nfinancial statements to their annual returns.\nLiquidity risk and capital management\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its\nfinancial activities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s objective when managing\nliquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they fall due and to provide adequately\nfor contingencies.\nThe Group’s cash and liquid resources comprise cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and\nrestricted cash. The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Group’s long-term debt and equity. The Group’s\npolicy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to maintain\nsufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events. In addition, the Group aims to achieve the\nbest available return on investments of surplus cash – subject to credit risk and liquidity constraints.\nF-39\nThe Group finances its working capital requirements through a combination of cash generated from operations,\nbank loans and debt capital market issuances for general corporate purposes including the acquisition of aircraft. The\nGroup had cash and liquid resources at March 31, 2024 of €4.2bn (2023: €4.7bn; 2022: €3.6bn). During the year, the\nGroup had a net cash outflows of €2.4bn in relation to property, plant and equipment (2023: outflow of €1.8bn; 2022:\noutflow of €1bn). Cash generated from operations has been the principal source for these cash requirements during the\nyear. The Group repaid a €750m 1.125% Eurobond under its EMTN programme in August 2023 and €260m under the\nGroup’s Revolving Credit Facility in November 2023.\nThe Board of Directors periodically reviews the capital structure of the Group, considering the cost of capital\nand the risks associated with each class of capital. The Board approves any material adjustments to the capital structure\nin terms of the relative proportions of debt and equity.\nManagement believes that the working capital available to the Group is sufficient for its present requirements\nand will be sufficient to meet its anticipated requirements for capital expenditures and other cash requirements for fiscal\nyear 2025.\nAt March 31, 2024, the Group had total borrowings of €2.7bn (2023: €4.1bn; 2022: €5.1bn), including capitalized\nleases (under IFRS 16) of €165m (2023: €206m, 2022: €138m) from various financial institutions and the debt capital\nmarkets. Financing for the acquisition of nil Boeing 737-800NG aircraft (2023: 7; 2022: 50) was provided on the basis of\nguarantees granted by the Ex-Im Bank. The remaining long-term debt relates to two unsecured Eurobonds, with a\ncumulative amount of €2.1bn, a €490m unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, and 28 aircraft held under operating leases\nin right of use assets.\nExposure to liquidity risk\nThe following are the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities at the reporting date.

At the 2019 AGM, shareholders approved LTIP 2019. LTIP 2019\nreplaces Option Plan 2013 for all future share based remuneration grants. There were approximately 2.4m cumulative\nconditional ordinary shares granted under LTIP 2019 at March 31, 2024.\nDetails of the share options outstanding are set out below:\nShare Weighted Avg.\nOptions Exercise\nM Price (€)\nOutstanding at March 31, 2021 30.0 9.83\nGranted — —\nForfeited (0.7) 12.98\nExercised (6.5) 7.23\nOutstanding at March 31, 2022 22.8 10.57\nGranted — —\nForfeited — —\nExercised (4.1) 7.64\nOutstanding at March 31, 2023 18.7 11.24\nGranted — —\nForfeited (0.7) 11.12\nExercised (1.4) 12.00\nOutstanding at March 31, 2024 16.6 11.18\nThe mid-market price of Ryanair Holdings plc’s ordinary shares on Euronext Dublin at March 31, 2024 was\n€21.06 (2023: €14.95; 2022: €13.59). The highest and lowest prices at which the Company’s shares traded on Euronext\nDublin in fiscal year 2024 were €21.49 and €13.96 respectively (fiscal year 2023 were €15.76 and €10.09 respectively;\nfiscal year 2022 were €18.45 and €11.83 respectively). There were 0.2m options exercisable at March 31, 2024 (2023:\n1.7m; 2022: 4.3m). The average share price for fiscal year 2024 was €17.09 (2023: €13.20; 2022: €16.08).\nThere were 1.4m options exercised during fiscal year 2024 (2023: 4.1m; 2022: 6.5m).\nF-51\nAt March 31, 2024 the range of exercise prices and weighted average remaining contractual life of outstanding\noptions are shown in the table below.\nNo. Remaining\nExercise options contractual\nprice outstanding life\n€ M (years)\nUnvested 11.12 16.0 4.9\nVested 11.12 0.5 1.9\nVested 12.00 0.1 0.4\nWeighted average 11.18 16.6 4.7\nThe Company has accounted for its share option and LTIP grants to employees at fair value, in accordance with\nIFRS 2, using a binomial lattice model to value the option grants. This has resulted in a credit of approximately €4m to\nthe income statement (2023: charge of €16m; 2022: charge of €9m) being recognized within the income statement in\naccordance with employee services rendered.\nA blend of the historical and implied volatilities of the Company’s own ordinary shares is used to determine\nexpected volatility for share options granted. The weighted-average volatility is determined by calculating the weighted-\naverage of volatilities for all share options granted in a given year. The expected term of share option grants represents\nthe weighted-average period the awards are expected to remain outstanding. The service period is five years in relation\nto share options and three years in relation to LTIP conditional share grants.\n15. Other reserves\nThe total share-based payments reserve at March 31, 2024 was approximately €34m (2023: €41m; 2022: €31m).\nThe total cash flow hedge reserve amounted to positive €266m at March 31, 2024 (2023: positive €31m; 2022: positive\n€1,295m). Further details of the Group’s derivatives are set out in Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements.\n16. Analysis of operating revenues and segmental analysis\nThe Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided to\nthe Group CEO, who is the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).\nThe Group comprises five separate airlines, Buzz, Lauda Europe (“Lauda”), Malta Air, Ryanair DAC and Ryanair\nUK (which is consolidated within Ryanair DAC). Ryanair DAC is reported as a separate segment as it exceeds the\napplicable quantitative thresholds for reporting purposes. Buzz, Malta Air and Lauda do not individually exceed the\nquantitative thresholds and accordingly are presented on an aggregate basis as they exhibit similar economic\ncharacteristics and their services, activities and operations are sufficiently similar in nature. The results of these\noperations are included as ‘Other Airlines.’ Due to a change in the composition of reportable segments in fiscal year\n2024, comparative tables have been updated in accordance with IFRS 8.\nThe CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the profit after tax of each airline for the\nreporting period. Resource allocation decisions for all airlines are based on airline performance for the relevant period,\nwith the objective in making these resource allocation decisions being to optimise consolidated financial results.\nF-52\nReportable segment information is presented as follows:\nAt Marc h 31 , 2024\nRyanair DAC Other Airlines Elimination Total\n€M €M €M €M\nScheduled revenue 9,037.7 107.4 — 9,145.1\nAncillary revenue 4,298.7 — — 4,298.7\nInter-segment revenue 744.6 1,366.1 (2,110.7) —\nSegment revenue 14,081.0 1,473.5 (2,110.7) 13,443.8\nReportable segment profit after income tax 1,860.0 57.1 — 1,917.1\nOther segment information:\nDepreciation (1,018.0) (41.5) — (1,059.5)\nFinance expense (74.7) (8.3) — (83.0)\nFinance income 144.8 — — 144.8\nCapital expenditure (1,926.6) (42.7) — (1,969.3)\nReportable segment assets 16,867.5 308.1 — 17,175.6\nReportable segment liabilities 8,948.7 612.7 — 9,561.4\nAt March 31, 2023\nRyanair DAC Other Airlines Elimination Total\n€M €M €M €M\nScheduled revenue 6,843.4 86.9 — 6,930.3\nAncillary revenue 3,844.9 — — 3,844.9\nInter-segment revenue 759.4 1,294.5 (2,053.9) —\nSegment revenue 11,447.7 1,381.4 (2,053.9) 10,775.2\nReportable segment profit after income tax (i) 1,382.3 45.7 — 1,428.0\nOther segment information:\nDepreciation (876.6) (46.6) — (923.2)\nFinance expense (70.2) (6.6) — (76.8)\nFinance income 42.4 — — 42.4\nCapital expenditure (1,760.1) (153.0) — (1,913.1)\nReportable segment assets 15,920.4 485.5 — 16,405.9\nReportable segment liabilities 9,914.7 848.2 — 10,762.9\nAt March 31, 2022\nRyanair DAC Other Airlines Elimination Total\n€M €M €M €M\nScheduled revenue 2,616.1 36.4 — 2,652.5\nAncillary revenue 2,148.4 — — 2,148.4\nInter-segment revenue 698.5 1,086.3 (1,784.8) —\nSegment revenue 5,463.0 1,122.7 (1,784.8) 4,800.9\nReportable segment (loss)/profit after income tax (i) (354.7) (0.3) — (355.0)\nOther segment information:\nDepreciation (660.1) (59.3) — (719.4)\nFinance expense (87.8) (3.6) — (91.4)\nFinance income — — — —\nCapital expenditure (1,527.8) (5.0) — (1,532.8)\nReportable segment assets 14,832.1 317.7 — 15,149.8\nReportable segment liabilities 8,879.3 725.2 — 9,604.5\n(i) Reportable segment profit after income tax in the financial year ended March 31, 2023, excludes a net exceptional loss after tax of €114m,\nattributable to the fair value measurement of jet fuel call options.

In accordance with IFRS 8,\nrevenue by country of origin has been provided where revenue for that country is in excess of 10% of total revenue.\nIreland is presented as it represents the country of domicile. “Other” includes all other countries in which the Group has\noperations.\nYear ended\nMarch 31,\n2024 2023 2022\n€M €M €M\nItaly 2,853.3 2,364.5 1,188.8\nSpain 2,416.2 1,883.4 873.8\nUnited Kingdom 2,031.0 1,589.7 564.0\nIreland 791.0 640.4 229.6\nOther 5,352.3 4,297.2 1,944.7\nTotal revenue 13,443.8 10,775.2 4,800.9\nAncillary revenues comprise revenues from non-flight scheduled operations, in-flight sales and internet-related\nservices. Non-flight scheduled revenue arises from the sale of priority boarding, allocated seats, car hire, travel\ninsurance, airport transfers, room reservations and other sources, including excess baggage charges and other fees, all\ndirectly attributable to the low-fares business.\nThe vast majority of ancillary revenue is recognized at a point in time, which is typically the flight date. The\neconomic factors that would impact the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows associated\nwith the provision of passenger travel-related ancillary services are homogeneous across the various component\ncategories within ancillary revenue. Accordingly, there is no further disaggregation of ancillary revenue required in\naccordance with IFRS 15.\nAll of the Group’s operating profits/(losses) arise from lowfares airline-related activities. The major revenue\nearning assets of the Group are its aircraft. Since the Group’s aircraft fleet is flexibly employed across its route network\nin Europe, there is no suitable basis of allocating such assets and related liabilities to geographical segments.\n17. Staff numbers and costs\nThe average weekly number of staff, including the Executive Director, during the year, analyzed by category, was\nas follows:\nYear ended\nMarch 31,\n2024 2023 2022\nFlight and cabin crew 21,602 18,432 15,289\nSales, operations, management and administration 2,896 2,365 1,958\nAverage 24,498 20,797 17,247\nAt March 31, 2024 the Company had a team of 27,076 aviation professionals (2023: 22,261; 2022: 19,116).\nF-54\nThe aggregate payroll costs of these persons were as follows: Year ended\nMarch 31,\n2024 2023 2022\n€M €M €M\nStaff and related costs 1,335.4 1,085.4 641.1\nSocial welfare costs 156.1 80.8 32.5\nOther pension costs (a) 12.4 9.0 7.9\nShare based payments (3.9) 16.2 8.6\n1,500.0 1,191.4 690.1\n(a) Costs in respect of defined-contribution benefit plans and other pension arrangements were €12m in 2024 (2023:\n€9m; 2022: €8m).\nStaff costs capitalized into assets (and therefore excluded from the table above) during the fiscal year 2024\namounted to €58m (2023: €36m; 2022: €28m).\nGovernment grants and assistance\nDuring recent years, many European countries in which the Ryanair Group operates made available payroll\nsupport schemes. The Ryanair Group utilized a number of these employment retention schemes to protect jobs within\nthe Group. These schemes were a mix of short term Covid-19 specific programs and longterm schemes linked to social\nsecurity that existed pre Covid-19. The total amount of payroll supports received by the Group under the various schemes\namounted to €nil in fiscal year 2024 (2023: €nil; 2022: €82m) and are offset against staff costs in the consolidated\nincome statement. Such supports wound down significantly in the second half of fiscal year 2022.\nIn April 2020, the Group raised £600m unsecured debt for general corporate purposes under the HMT and Bank\nof England CCFF. The 0.44% interest rate was the prevailing rate for strong BBB rated companies. This debt was\nextended in March 2021 for a further 12 months at a 0.46% interest rate. In October 2021 the Group repaid the £600m\nHMT and Bank of England CCFF in full.\nThere are no unfulfilled conditions attaching to government assistance at March 31, 2024.\nF-55\n18.

The\ntotal accumulated accrued benefit for Mr. O’Leary at March 31, 2024 was €0.1m (2023: €0.1m; 2022: €0.1m). Pension\nbenefits have been computed in accordance with Section 6.1 of the Listing Rules of Euronext Dublin. Increases in\ntransfer values of the accrued benefits have been calculated as at the year-end in accordance with version 1.1 of\nActuarial Standard of Practice PEN-11.\nMr. O’Leary is a member of a defined contribution plan. During the years ended March 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nthe Company did not make contributions to the defined contribution plan for Mr. O’Leary. No Non-Executive Directors\nare members of the Company pension plans or received pension contributions in fiscal years ended March 31, 2024,\n2023 and 2022.\n19. Finance expense and finance income\nFinance expense of €83m (2023: €77m; 2022: €91m) primarily relates to interest on debt obligations. Finance\nincome of €145m (2023: €42m; 2022: €nil) primarily relates to deposit interest.\nF-57\n20. Retirement benefits\nDefined contribution schemes\nAt March 31, 2024 the Company operates defined-contribution retirement plans in Ireland and the UK.\nThe costs of these plans are charged to the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are\nincurred. The pension cost of these defined contribution plans was €12m in fiscal year 2024 (2023: €9m; 2022: €8m).\nDefined-benefit schemes\nDuring fiscal year 2016 the Company closed the defined benefit plan for UK employees to future accruals. The\nnet pension asset recognized in the consolidated balance sheet for the scheme at March 31, 2024 was €3m (2023: net\npension liability of €4m; 2022: net pension liability of €4m). Costs associated with the scheme during fiscal year 2024\nwere €nil (2023: €nil; 2022 €nil).\nThe amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet in respect of defined benefit plans are as follows:\nA t March 31 ,\n2024 2023 2022\n€M €M €M\nPresent value of benefit obligations (13.3) (14.9) (14.9)\nFair value of plan assets 16.4 10.4 10.4\nPresent value of net obligations 3.1 (4.5) (4.5)\nRelated deferred tax (liability)/asset (0.4) 0.6 0.6\nNet pension asset/(liability) 2.7 (3.9) (3.9)\n21.

See below for explanation of diluted number of ordinary shares.\nDiluted earnings per share takes account solely of the potential future exercise of share options and conditional\nshares granted under the Company’s share option and LTIP 2019 schemes. For fiscal year 2022, due to the loss-making\nposition, share options are anti-dilutive in accordance with IAS 33 and therefore are not assumed to be converted. For\nfiscal year 2024, the weighted average number of shares in issue of 1,145m (2023: 1,140m) includes weighted average\nshare options assumed to be converted, and equal to a total of 6m (2023: 3m) shares.\nThe average market value of the Company’s shares for the purpose of calculating the dilutive effect of the share\noptions was based on quoted market prices for the year during which the options were outstanding.\nF-58\n22. Commitments and contingencies\nCommitments\nIn September 2014, the Group agreed to purchase up to 200 Boeing 737-8200 aircraft (100 firm orders and 100\nsubject to option) from The Boeing Company over a five year period originally due to commence in fiscal year 2020 (the\n“2014 Boeing Contract”). This agreement was approved at an EGM of Ryanair Holdings plc on November 28, 2014.\nSubsequently, the Group agreed to purchase an additional 10 Boeing 737-8200 aircraft bringing the total number of\nBoeing 737-8200 aircraft on order to 210 (assuming all options are exercised). In April 2018, the Company announced\nthat it had converted 25 Boeing 737-8200 options into firm orders bringing the Company’s firm order to 135 Boeing 737-\n8200s with a further 75 options remaining. In December 2020, shortly after the FAA's ungrounding of the Boeing 737-\nMAX aircraft in the U.S., the Company announced that it had converted its remaining 75 Boeing 737-8200 options into\nfirm orders bringing the Company’s firm order to 210 Boeing 737-8200 aircraft. Following certification of the Boeing 737-\n8200 by the FAA in late March 2021, and EASA in early April 2021, the Group took delivery of its first Boeing 737-8200 in\nJune 2021 and had 146 of these aircraft in its fleet at March 31, 2024. Deliveries are expected to continue until the end\nof fiscal year 2025.\nIn May 2023, the Group agreed to purchase up to 300 Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft (150 firm orders and 150\nsubject to option) from the Boeing Company for delivery between 2027 and 2033. This agreement received shareholder\napproval at the Company’s AGM in September 2023.\nThe table below includes the future Purchase Obligations for firm aircraft purchases under the existing 2014\nand 2023 Boeing Contracts. This table is calculated by multiplying the number of firm aircraft the Group is obligated to\npurchase under its agreements with Boeing during the relevant period by the standard list price of approximately U.S.\n$102.5m for each Boeing 737-8200 aircraft and U.S.$135m for each Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft, adjusted for (i) basic\ncredits (approximately 60% of the standard list price); (ii) price escalation over the original scheduled delivery timeframe;\nand (iii) advance payments paid in prior fiscal years. The dollar-denominated obligations are converted into euro at the\nyear-end exchange rate of U.S. $1.0793 = €1.00. The Group is eligible for further customer specific credits, reflective,\ninter alia, of its longstanding partnership with Boeing, its launch customer status for both the Boeing 737-8200 aircraft\nand the Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft, its commitment to purchase 210 Boeing 737-8200 aircraft under the 2014 Boeing\nContract and up to 300 Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft under the 2023 Boeing Contract and the delayed commencement\nof Boeing 737-8200 aircraft deliveries. These customer specific credits are not included in the table below but will reduce\nthe average amount payable per aircraft, and therefore, the Group’s obligations due under the 2014 Boeing Contract and\n2023 Boeing Contract. The Group considers that Boeing customer specific credits are not material to the Group’s cash\noutflows over the time horizon of the 2014 Boeing Contract or the time horizon of the 2023 Boeing Contract. Under the\nterms of the 2014 Boeing Contract and 2023 Boeing Contract, the Group is required to make periodic advance payments\nof the purchase price for aircraft it has agreed to purchase over the two-year period preceding the scheduled delivery of\naircraft with the balance of the purchase price being due at the time of delivery. Purchase Obligations detailed below\nare based on an agreed delivery schedule as of March 31, 2024.\nObli ga tions Due by P er iod\nPurchase Obligations Total <1 year 1-2 years 2-5 years After 5 years\n€M €M €M €M €M\nPurchase contracts with Boeing 11,653 2,162 186 3,889 5,416\nF-59\nContingencies\nThe Company is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business. Although no assurance can\nbe given as to the outcome of any current or pending litigation, management does not believe that any such litigation\nwill, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition of\nthe Company, except as described below. Since 2002, the European Commission has examined the agreements between\nRyanair and various airports to establish whether they constituted illegal state aid. In many cases, the European\nCommission has concluded that the agreements did not constitute state aid. In other cases, Ryanair has successfully\nchallenged the European Commission finding that there was state aid. In 2014, the European Commission announced\nfindings of state aid to Ryanair in its arrangements with Pau, Nimes, Angouleme, Altenburg and Zweibrücken airports,\nordering Ryanair to repay a total of approximately €10m of alleged aid. In 2016, the European Commission announced\nfindings of state aid to Ryanair in its arrangements with Cagliari and Klagenfurt, ordering Ryanair to repay approximately\n€13m of alleged aid. Ryanair appealed these “aid” decisions to the EU General Court. In 2018, the General Court upheld\nthe Commission’s findings regarding Ryanair’s arrangements with Pau, Nimes, Angouleme and Altenburg airports, and\noverturned the Commission’s finding regarding Ryanair’s arrangement with Zweibrücken airport. Ryanair appealed the\nnegative findings to the Court of Justice of the EU but in 2019 Ryanair discontinued these appeals as the Court had\nrefused to grant an oral hearing in any of the cases. The appeal before the General Court regarding Ryanair’s\narrangements with Cagliari airport has been discontinued following the European Commission’s withdrawal of its\ndecision in 2023 as a result of a General Court ruling in a related case. In 2021, the General Court upheld the European\nCommission’s finding regarding Ryanair’s arrangements with Klagenfurt airport. Ryanair appealed this negative finding\nto the Court of Justice of the EU in 2021 and received a ruling in 2023 where the European Commission’s finding was\nupheld. In 2019, the European Commission announced findings of state aid to Ryanair in its arrangements with\nMontpellier airport, ordering Ryanair to repay a total of approximately €9m of alleged aid. Ryanair appealed the\nMontpellier “aid” decision in 2021 to the EU General Court and received a judgment in 2023 upholding the European\nCommission’s finding. Ryanair appealed the General Court judgment to the European Court of Justice. In 2022, the\nEuropean Commission announced findings of state aid to Ryanair in its arrangements with La Rochelle airport, ordering\nRyanair to repay a total of approximately €8.4m of alleged aid. Ryanair has appealed this finding of state aid to the\nGeneral Court. Ryanair is facing similar legal challenges with respect to agreements with certain other airports, notably\nCarcassonne, Girona, Reus, Târgu Mureș, Beziers and Frankfurt (Hahn). These investigations are ongoing (as is the\nEuropean Commission’s re-examination of the Cagliari case following its withdrawal in March 2023 of the 2016 “aid”\ndecision), and Ryanair currently expects that they will conclude in 2024, with any European Commission decisions\nappealable to the EU General Court. Ryanair is also facing an allegation in a German court case launched by Lufthansa\nin 2006 that it has benefited from unlawful state aid in relation to its arrangements with Frankfurt (Hahn). Adverse rulings\nin the above or similar cases could be used as precedents by competitors to challenge Ryanair’s agreements with other\npublicly owned airports and could cause Ryanair to strongly reconsider its growth strategy in relation to public or state-\nowned airports across Europe. This could in turn lead to a scaling back of Ryanair’s growth strategy due to the smaller\nnumber of privately owned airports available for development. No assurance can be given as to the outcome of these\nproceedings, nor as to whether any unfavorable outcomes may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse\neffect on the results of operations or financial condition of the Company.\nIn mid-2023, the Spanish Ministry of Consumer Affairs launched sanctioning proceedings against Ryanair and\nseveral other airlines regarding cabin baggage and other customer policies. The Company filed submissions with the\nMinistry explaining that its policies are fair, necessary for operational and safety purposes, and fully transparent. In May\n2024, the Ministry ordered the discontinuation of these policies and imposed substantial fines on Ryanair and other\nairlines (a cumulative total of approx. €150 million). These decisions are subject to review by the Minister of Consumer\nAffairs, which is expected to conclude between June and September 2024, with any final decisions appealable to courts.\nRyanair intends to fully defend its position with reference to its rights under Spanish and EU law, as well as positive court\nrulings in similar matters, but the outcome of these proceedings cannot be guaranteed.\nF-60\n23.

The Board’s primary focus is on strategy formulation, policy and control. It has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for its attention, including matters such as approval of the annual budget, large capital expenditure, and key strategic decisions.\n\nOther matters reserved to the Board include treasury policy and procedures, internal control, audit and risk management, ESG, remuneration of the Executive Director and Senior Management and corporate governance. The Board has delegated responsibility for the management of the Group to the Group CEO and the Senior Management team. There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Group CEO, which is set out in writing and has been approved by the Board.\n\n### **Chairman**\n\nStan McCarthy has served as the Chairman of the Board since June 2020, having served as Deputy Chairman from April 2019. He was appointed a Director in May 2017. The Chairman’s primary responsibility is to lead the Board, to ensure that it has a common purpose, is effective as a group and at individual Director level, and that it upholds and promotes high standards of integrity and corporate governance. He ensures that Board agendas cover the key strategic issues confronting the Group; that the Board reviews and approves management’s plans for the Group; and that Directors receive accurate, timely, clear and relevant information.\n\nThe Chairman is the link between the Board and the Company. He is specifically responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective working relationship with the Group CEO, for ensuring effective and appropriate communications with shareholders and for ensuring that members of the Board develop and maintain an understanding of the views of shareholders.\n\nWhile Stan McCarthy holds a small number of other directorships, the Board considers that these do not interfere with the discharge of his duties to Ryanair.\n\n### **Senior Independent Director**\n\nThe Board appointed Róisín Brennan as the Senior Independent Director (“SID”) with effect from April 2024, a role previously held by Louise Phelan. The SID is available to shareholders who have concerns that cannot be addressed through the Chairman, Group CEO or Group CFO and leads the annual Board review of the performance of the Chairman.\n\n### **Company Secretary**\n\nThe appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the Board. All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary (Juliusz Komorek), who is responsible to the Board for ensuring that Board procedures are complied with.\n\n### **Membership**\n\nAt March 31, 2024 the Board consisted of one Executive, a Non-Executive Chairman and 12 Non-Executive Directors (“NEDs”) and approximately 43% of the Board were women. Following the retirement of Michael Cawley and Louise Phelan (both in June 2024) and the appointments of Jinane Laghrari Laabi and Amber Rudd (both from July 1, 2024) the gender split is 50:50. It is the practice of Ryanair that a majority of the Board will be Non-Executives, each considered by the Board to be independent, and the Chairman is Non-Executive. The Board considers the current size, composition and diversity of the Board to be appropriate. The Board, with the assistance of the Nomination Committee, keeps Board composition under review to ensure that it includes the necessary mix of relevant skills and experience required to perform its role.\n\nEach Director has extensive business experience, which they bring to bear in governing the Company. The Board considers that, between them, the Directors bring the range of skills, knowledge, diversity, and experience, including international and aviation experience, necessary to lead the Group. The Chairman has significant public company experience. Historically, the Company has always separated the roles of Chairman and Group CEO for the running of the business and implementation of the Board’s strategy and policy.\n\n**Name**| **Roles**| **Independent**  \n---|---|---  \nS. McCarthy| Non-Exec Chairman| Yes  \nE. Brennan| Non-Exec| Yes  \nR. Brennan| Non-Exec| Yes  \nE. Daly| Non-Exec| Yes  \nG. Doherty| Non-Exec| Yes  \nB. Grabowski| Non-Exec| Yes  \nE. Köstinger| Non-Exec| Yes  \nJ. Laghrari Laabi| Non-Exec| Yes  \nH. Millar| Non-Exec| Yes  \nD. Milliken| Non-Exec| Yes  \nA. Nolan| Non-Exec| Yes  \nM. O’Brien| Non-Exec| Yes  \nA. Rudd| Non-Exec| Yes  \nM. O’Leary| Group CEO| No  \n  \n### **Independence**\n\nThe Board has carried out its annual evaluation of the independence of each of its NEDs, taking account of the relevant provisions of the 2018 Code, namely, whether each Director is independent in character and judgement and free from relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, the Director’s judgement. The Board regards all of the NEDs at the date of this report as independent and has concluded that no one individual or group exerts an undue influence on others. Within its independence review, the Board has considered the following items with respect to certain individual NEDs.\n\nThe Board considered Howard Millar’s outside business interests and the (9 month) gap between finishing his Executive role in 2014 and his election to the Board in 2015 and concluded that his previous employment with Ryanair did not compromise his independence of judgement and character. Additionally, as it is more than 5 years since he served as a Company Manager, Howard Millar is considered to be independent under the 2018 Code.\n\nThe Board considered Mike O’Brien’s outside business interests, as well as the gap (25 years) between finishing his Executive role with Ryanair and his election to the Board in 2016 and concluded that his previous employment with Ryanair did not compromise his independence of judgement and character.\n\n### **Compliance Statement**\n\nRyanair has complied, throughout the year ended March 31, 2024, with the provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code and the requirements set out in the Irish Corporate Governance Annex, except as outlined below. The Group has not complied with the following provisions of the 2018 Code, but continues to review these situations on an ongoing basis:\n\n  * NEDs historically participated in the Company’s share option plans. In accordance with the 2018 Code, the Company sought and received shareholder approval to make certain modest stock option grants to its NEDs and as described above, the Board believes the quantum of historic, unvested options granted to certain NEDs is not so significant as to impair their independence. At the 2019 AGM, shareholders approved a new LongTerm Incentive Plan (“LTIP 2019”). Under LTIP 2019, NEDs cannot receive share options but will be eligible to receive non-conditional ordinary shares from time to time.\n\n\n\n### **Group UK Tax Strategy**\n\n[View document](https://investor.ryanair.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Ryanair-DAC-Tax-Strategy-Report-2024.pdf)\n\n### ****Form 8937 – Ryanair – ADR Ratio Change****\n\n[View document](/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Form-8937-Ryanair-ADR-Ratio-Change.pdf)\n\n### **UK Pension Scheme**\n\nRyanair UK Pension Plan DC Governance Statement y/e 31.12.18 – [View document](https://investor.ryanair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ryanair-UK-Pension-Plan-DC-Governance-Statement-ye-31.12.18.pdf)\n\nRyanair UK Pension Plan Trustee Report and Financial Statements y/e 31.12.19 – [View document](https://investor.ryanair.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ryanair-UK-Pension-Plan-2019-Report-and-accounts-signed.pdf)\n\nRyanair UK Pension Plan 2020 SIP – [View document](https://investor.ryanair.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Ryanair-UK-Final-SIPP_2020-Final.pdf)\n\nRyanair UK Pension Plan Trustee Report and Financial Statements y/e 31.12.20 – [View document ](https://investor.ryanair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Ryanair-UK-Pension-Plan-2020-Report-and-accounts-signed.pdf)\n\nRyanair UK Pension Plan DC Implementation Statement 31.12.20 – [View document](https://investor.ryanair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Ryanair-DC-Implementation-Statement-vf.pdf)\n\nRyanair UK Pension Plan Trustee Report and Financial Statements y/e 31.12.21 – [View document](https://investor.ryanair.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Ryanair-Trustee-Report-and-Financial-Statement-31.12.2021-Final-Signed.pdf)\n\nRyanair UK Pension Plan Trustee Report and Financial Statements y/e 31.12.22 – [View document ](https://investor.ryanair.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ryanair-Trustee-Report-and-Financial-Statement-31.12.2022.pdf)\n\nRyanair UK Pension Plan DC Implementation Statement 31.12.22 – [View document](https://investor.ryanair.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ryanair-UK-Pension-Plan-Implementation-Statement-for-year-ending-31-December-2022.pdf)\n\nRyanair UK Pension Plan 2024 SIP – [View document](https://investor.ryanair.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Ryanair-UK-Pension-Plan-2024-SIP.pdf)\n\n### **Gender Pay Report**\n\n**UK**\n\n2017 report – [View document](https://investor.ryanair.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ryanair-gender-pay-gap.pdf)\n\n2018 report – [View document](https://investor.ryanair.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RYANAIR-GENDER-PAY-GAP-2018.pdf)\n\n2019 report – *\n\n2020 report – [View document](https://investor.ryanair.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ryanair-Gender-Pay-Gap-Report-2020.pdf)\n\n2021 report – [View document](https://investor.ryanair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Gender-Pay-Gap-Infograph-2021.pdf)\n\n2022 report – [View document](https://investor.ryanair.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ryanair-UK-Gender-Pay-Gap-Infograph-2022.pdf)\n\n2023 report – [View document](https://investor.ryanair.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Ryanair-UK-Gender-Pay-Gap-Infograph-2023.pdf)\n\n* In line with UK Government’s Guidelines on 24th March 2020, Gender Pay reporting requirements were suspended for the reporting year 2019.\n\n**Ireland**\n\nRyanair DAC – Gender Pay Gap Report – 2022 [View document](https://investor.ryanair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Ryanair-DAC-–-Gender-Pay-Gap-Report-–-2022.pdf)\n\nRyanair DAC – Gender Pay Gap Report – 2023 [View document](https://investor.ryanair.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Ryanair-Gender-Pay-Gap-Report-2023.pdf)\n"
