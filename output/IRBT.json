However, our overall results did not meet the expectations we set in August, as persistent market segment and competitive headwinds impacted our sell-through performance. Although we now expect it will take more time to stabilize our revenue trend, we are on track to exceed our operating expense targets for the year, while at the same time continuing to invest in areas that are expected to drive growth.\n\n\"Our ongoing restructuring has fundamentally changed the way we innovate, develop and build our robots, which is central to improving our performance and generating long-term shareholder value. With the benefit of lower operating costs, we expect to enhance margins and improve profitability in 2025.\n\n\"As we move forward in this new chapter in iRobot's history, one thing is abundantly clear: we have a powerful brand that will serve as the foundation for the turnaround of this Company. That brand power is at the heart of our turnaround strategy, iRobot Elevate. In executing that strategy, we are focused on providing our iconic brand with an improved platform to drive long-term profitable growth.\"\n\n**Third-Quarter 2024 Financial Results (****in millions, except per share amounts and percentages)**\n\n**Q3 2024** |  **Q3 2023**  \n---|---  \n**Revenue** |  $193.4 |  $186.2  \n**GAAP Gross Margin** |  32.2 % |  25.8 %  \n**Non-GAAP Gross Margin** |  32.4 % |  26.5 %  \n**GAAP Operating Expenses** |  $55.1 |  $107.5  \n**Non-GAAP Operating Expenses** |  $47.7 |  $90.1  \n**GAAP Operating Income (Loss)** |  $7.3 |  ($59.5)  \n**Non-GAAP Operating Income (Loss)** |  $15.1 |  ($40.6)  \n**GAAP Net Loss Per Share** |  ($0.21) |  ($2.86)  \n**Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) Per Share*** |  $0.03 |  ($2.82)  \n  \n_*Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company updated its calculation of non-GAAP financial measures to no longer exclude \"IP litigation expense, net.\" The metrics are presented in accordance with this updated methodology.

These forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations, estimates and projections about its business and industry, all of which are subject to change. In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"could,\" \"seek,\" \"see,\" \"will,\" \"may,\" \"would,\" \"might,\" \"potentially,\" \"estimate,\" \"continue,\" \"expect,\" \"target,\" similar expressions or the negatives of these words or other comparable terminology that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes.

These and other forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any such statements and caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (i) the Company's ability to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all; (ii) the Company's ability to realize the benefits of its operational restructuring; (iii) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and various global conflicts on the Company's business and general economic conditions; (iv) the Company's ability to implement its business strategy; (v) the risk that disruptions from the operational restructuring will harm the Company's business, including current plans and operations; (vi) the ability of the Company to retain and hire key personnel, including successfully navigating its leadership transition; (vii) legislative, regulatory and economic developments affecting the Company's business; (viii) general economic and market developments and conditions; (ix) the evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes under which the Company operates; (x) potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships that could affect the Company's financial performance; (xi) unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities; (xii) current supply chain challenges including the Red Sea conflict; (xiii) the financial strength of our customers and retailers; (xiv) the impact of tariffs on goods imported into the United States; and (xv) competition, as well as the Company's response to any of the aforementioned factors.

We use non-GAAP measures to internally evaluate and analyze financial results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and enable comparison of our financial results with other public companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.\n\n_Amortization of acquired intangible assets:_ Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets including completed technology, customer relationships, and reacquired distribution rights acquired in connection with business combinations as well as any non-cash impairment charges associated with intangible assets in connection with our past acquisitions. Amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. We exclude these charges from our non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.\n\n_Net Merger , Acquisition and Divestiture (Income) Expense: _Net merger, acquisition and divestiture (income) expense primarily consists of transaction fees, professional fees, and transition and integration costs directly associated with mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, including with respect to the iRobot-Amazon Merger. It also includes business combination adjustments including adjustments after the measurement period has ended. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the adjustment included the one-time net termination fee received as a result of the termination of the iRobot-Amazon Merger. The occurrence and amount of these costs will vary depending on the timing and size of these transactions. We exclude these charges from our non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.\n\n_Stock-Based Compensation:_ Stock-based compensation is a non-cash charge relating to stock-based awards. We exclude this expense as it is a non-cash expense, and we assess our internal operations excluding this expense and believe it facilitates comparisons to the performance of other companies.\n\n_Restructuring and Other:_ Restructuring charges are related to one-time actions associated with realigning resources, enhancing operational productivity and efficiency, or improving our cost structure in support of our strategy. Such actions are not reflective of ongoing operations and include costs primarily associated with severance and related costs, charges related to paused work unrelated to our core business, costs associated with the Chief Executive Officer transition and other non-recurring costs directly associated with resource realignments tied to strategic initiatives or changes in business conditions. We exclude these items from our non-GAAP measures when evaluating our recent and prospective business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the action and do not reflect anticipated future operating costs. In addition, these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of our business.\n\n_Gain/Loss on Strategic Investments:_ Gain/loss on strategic investments includes fair value adjustments, realized gains and losses on the sales of these investments and losses on the impairment of these investments. We exclude these items from our non-GAAP measures because we do not believe they correlate to the performance of our core business and may vary in size based on market conditions and events. We believe that the exclusion of these gains or losses provides investors with a supplemental view of our operational performance.\n\n_Debt issuance costs:_ Debt issuance costs include various incremental fees and commissions paid to third parties in connection with the issuance of debt. We exclude these charges from our non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.\n\n_Income tax adjustments:_ Income tax adjustments include the tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments, calculated using the appropriate statutory tax rate for each adjustment. We regularly assess the need to record valuation allowances based on the non-GAAP profitability and other factors. We also exclude certain tax items, including the impact from stock-based compensation windfalls/shortfalls, which are not reflective of income tax expense incurred as a result of current period earnings.

(NASDAQ: IRBT), a leader in consumer robots, today announced availability of the 2-in-1 Roomba Combo _Â®_ 2 Essential robot and Roomba _Â®_ Vac 2 Essential robot in North America. These robots are the first in the company's affordable Essential series that automatically empty their dust bin into an AutoEmpty _â¢_ dock after cleaning. The robots also provide 2x the cleaning power of the original Essential series, an enhanced bumper design to more seamlessly navigate, and the ability to recharge and resume during cleaning missions. The Roomba Combo 2 Essential ($424.99 on [iRobot.com](http://iRobot.com) and at select retailers) and Roomba Vac Essential ($399.99 at select retailers) are packed with important and easy-to-use features, giving customers more time to do the things they love.\n\n[ ![The Roomba Combo 2 Essential automatically empties its dust bin into an AutoEmpty dock after cleaning. The robot also provides 2x the cleaning power of the original Essential series, an enhanced bumper design to more seamlessly navigate, and the ability to recharge and resume during cleaning missions.](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2535439/Roomba_Combo_2_Essential_Black_Photo_Studio_AutoEmpty_LeftFacing.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2535439/Roomba_Combo_2_Essential_Black_Photo_Studio_AutoEmpty_LeftFacing.html)\n\n\"Since introducing the first Roomba Essential series earlier this year, customers have praised the robots' ease-of-use and ability to keep their floors clean â at a great price,\" said Barry Schliesmann, chief product officer at iRobot. \"With more power and the ability to save customers even more time by emptying its own debris, the Roomba Combo 2 Essential and Roomba Vac 2 Essential provide an unmatched combination of cleaning efficacy, reliability, simplicity and value.\" \n\n**__Roomba Combo__**** __Â®__**** __2 Essential â 2x Cleaning Power1, 60 Days Hands-Free__** The Roomba Combo 2 Essential is designed with simplicity in mind, is easy to set up and includes all the features needed to keep floors clean. The robot cleans everyday messes with a 4-Stage Cleaning System that combines 100% stronger power-lifting suction1 with a Multi-Surface Bristle Brush, an Edge-Sweeping Brush, and a special textured, reusable microfiber mop pad. Customers can easily start a cleaning mission with a press of a button, a simple tap in the iRobot Home App, or a quick command to a voice assistant.2 The robot uses specialized sensors to confidently navigate in precise, neat rows while taking advantage of its slim, sleek design and enhanced bumper to seamlessly clean around and under furniture.\n\nWith four levels of suction power and three levels of mopping water, the Roomba Combo 2 Essential effectively cleans all types of flooring and addresses a mix of customer cleaning needs, whether a gentle touch or a deeper clean is needed. Customers can choose to run a vacuum-only mission to clean both carpets and hard floors at the same time, or they can move their rugs out of the way to vacuum and wet mop in a single pass. The robot will clean for up to 120 minutes on a single charge, and when its battery is low, will automatically return to the AutoEmpty dock to recharge, resume and complete the cleaning task.\n\nThe AutoEmpty dock ensures a hassle-free cleaning experience and lets customers forget about vacuuming for up to two months, making it the ideal companion for busy households. When Roomba Combo 2 Essential finishes its cleaning job, the robot automatically empties the contents of its bin into a sealed bag that can hold up to 60 days' worth of dirt and debris. These advanced bags catch the tiniest of particles, as small as 0.7 microns, and when it's time to change a bag, it seals itself, preventing the mess of a dust cloud.\n\niRobot OS intelligence powers the Roomba Combo 2 Essential to work around ever-changing schedules. While customers can customize and automate their own cleaning routines, the robot is also able to recommend the best times to clean based on previous jobs. 'Clean While I'm Away' lets the Roomba Combo 2 Essential automatically start cleaning when a customer leaves home, letting them enjoy a cleaner home without doing a thing. Clean MapÂ® Reports show where the robot has cleaned and displays details, such as coverage and duration for completed jobs, giving customers peace of mind the job was done.\n\n**__Roomba__**** __Â®__**** __Vac 2 Essential__** For customers in North America, the RoombaÂ® Vac 2 Essential robot is available at select retailers, starting at $399.99. The Roomba Vac 2 Essential offers the same vacuuming power, intelligence, AutoEmpty dock and many of the same features as the Roomba Combo 2 Essential in a vacuum-only package. \n\n**Pricing & Availability **\n\nNorth America:The Roomba Combo 2 Essential robot ($424.99) is now available in North America on [iRobot.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4282370-1&h=3445505573&u=http%3A%2F%2Firobot.com%2F&a=iRobot.com) and at select retailers.

(NASDAQ: IRBT), a leader in consumer robots, today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 28, 2024.\n\n[ ![iRobot logo. \\(PRNewsfoto/iRobot Corp.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/610740/iRobot_v1_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/610740/iRobot_v1_Logo.html)\n\n\"We continue to make progress on our turnaround strategy,\" said Gary Cohen, iRobot's CEO. \"In the third quarter, we expanded our non-GAAP gross margin by 590 basis points year over year and improved our use of operating cash. However, our overall results did not meet the expectations we set in August, as persistent market segment and competitive headwinds impacted our sell-through performance. Although we now expect it will take more time to stabilize our revenue trend, we are on track to exceed our operating expense targets for the year, while at the same time continuing to invest in areas that are expected to drive growth.\n\n\"Our ongoing restructuring has fundamentally changed the way we innovate, develop and build our robots, which is central to improving our performance and generating long-term shareholder value. With the benefit of lower operating costs, we expect to enhance margins and improve profitability in 2025.\n\n\"As we move forward in this new chapter in iRobot's history, one thing is abundantly clear: we have a powerful brand that will serve as the foundation for the turnaround of this Company. That brand power is at the heart of our turnaround strategy, iRobot Elevate. In executing that strategy, we are focused on providing our iconic brand with an improved platform to drive long-term profitable growth.\"\n\n**Third-Quarter 2024 Financial Results (****in millions, except per share amounts and percentages)**\n\n**Q3 2024** |  **Q3 2023**  \n---|---  \n**Revenue** |  $193.4 |  $186.2  \n**GAAP Gross Margin** |  32.2 % |  25.8 %  \n**Non-GAAP Gross Margin** |  32.4 % |  26.5 %  \n**GAAP Operating Expenses** |  $55.1 |  $107.5  \n**Non-GAAP Operating Expenses** |  $47.7 |  $90.1  \n**GAAP Operating Income (Loss)** |  $7.3 |  ($59.5)  \n**Non-GAAP Operating Income (Loss)** |  $15.1 |  ($40.6)  \n**GAAP Net Loss Per Share** |  ($0.21) |  ($2.86)  \n**Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) Per Share*** |  $0.03 |  ($2.82)  \n  \n_*Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company updated its calculation of non-GAAP financial measures to no longer exclude \"IP litigation expense, net.\" The metrics are presented in accordance with this updated methodology. As a result, the third quarter ended September 30, 2023 differs from those previously presented by the amount of IP litigation expense, net recorded in such period._  \n---  \n  \n**Additional Financial Highlights**\n\n  * The Company increased non-GAAP gross margin in the third quarter by 590 basis points year over year as a result of its restructuring and iRobot Elevate initiatives.\n  * As of September 28, 2024, the Company's cash and cash equivalents totaled $99.4 million, compared with $108.5 million as of the end of the second quarter of 2024.

These forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations, estimates and projections about its business and industry, all of which are subject to change. In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"could,\" \"seek,\" \"see,\" \"will,\" \"may,\" \"would,\" \"might,\" \"potentially,\" \"estimate,\" \"continue,\" \"expect,\" \"target,\" similar expressions or the negatives of these words or other comparable terminology that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes. All forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and are not guarantees of future results, such as statements about the consummation of the proposed transaction and the anticipated benefits thereof. These and other forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any such statements and caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (i) the Company's ability to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all; (ii) the Company's ability to realize the benefits of its operational restructuring; (iii) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and various global conflicts on the Company's business and general economic conditions; (iv) the Company's ability to implement its business strategy; (v) the risk that disruptions from the operational restructuring will harm the Company's business, including current plans and operations; (vi) the ability of the Company to retain and hire key personnel, including successfully navigating its leadership transition; (vii) legislative, regulatory and economic developments affecting the Company's business; (viii) general economic and market developments and conditions; (ix) the evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes under which the Company operates; (x) potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships that could affect the Company's financial performance; (xi) unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities; (xii) current supply chain challenges including the Red Sea conflict; (xiii) the financial strength of our customers and retailers; (xiv) the impact of tariffs on goods imported into the United States; and (xv) competition, as well as the Company's response to any of the aforementioned factors. Additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements are included under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in the Company's most recent annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC and any subsequent reports on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q or Form 8-K filed from time to time and available at [www.sec.gov](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4295531-1&h=469893804&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov%2F&a=www.sec.gov). While the list of factors presented here is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

We use non-GAAP measures to internally evaluate and analyze financial results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and enable comparison of our financial results with other public companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.\n\n_Amortization of acquired intangible assets:_ Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets including completed technology, customer relationships, and reacquired distribution rights acquired in connection with business combinations as well as any non-cash impairment charges associated with intangible assets in connection with our past acquisitions. Amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. We exclude these charges from our non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.\n\n_Net Merger , Acquisition and Divestiture (Income) Expense: _Net merger, acquisition and divestiture (income) expense primarily consists of transaction fees, professional fees, and transition and integration costs directly associated with mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, including with respect to the iRobot-Amazon Merger. It also includes business combination adjustments including adjustments after the measurement period has ended. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the adjustment included the one-time net termination fee received as a result of the termination of the iRobot-Amazon Merger. The occurrence and amount of these costs will vary depending on the timing and size of these transactions. We exclude these charges from our non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.\n\n_Stock-Based Compensation:_ Stock-based compensation is a non-cash charge relating to stock-based awards. We exclude this expense as it is a non-cash expense, and we assess our internal operations excluding this expense and believe it facilitates comparisons to the performance of other companies.\n\n_Restructuring and Other:_ Restructuring charges are related to one-time actions associated with realigning resources, enhancing operational productivity and efficiency, or improving our cost structure in support of our strategy. Such actions are not reflective of ongoing operations and include costs primarily associated with severance and related costs, charges related to paused work unrelated to our core business, costs associated with the Chief Executive Officer transition and other non-recurring costs directly associated with resource realignments tied to strategic initiatives or changes in business conditions. We exclude these items from our non-GAAP measures when evaluating our recent and prospective business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the action and do not reflect anticipated future operating costs. In addition, these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of our business.\n\n_Gain/Loss on Strategic Investments:_ Gain/loss on strategic investments includes fair value adjustments, realized gains and losses on the sales of these investments and losses on the impairment of these investments. We exclude these items from our non-GAAP measures because we do not believe they correlate to the performance of our core business and may vary in size based on market conditions and events. We believe that the exclusion of these gains or losses provides investors with a supplemental view of our operational performance.\n\n_Debt issuance costs:_ Debt issuance costs include various incremental fees and commissions paid to third parties in connection with the issuance of debt. We exclude these charges from our non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.\n\n_Income tax adjustments:_ Income tax adjustments include the tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments, calculated using the appropriate statutory tax rate for each adjustment. We regularly assess the need to record valuation allowances based on the non-GAAP profitability and other factors. We also exclude certain tax items, including the impact from stock-based compensation windfalls/shortfalls, which are not reflective of income tax expense incurred as a result of current period earnings.
