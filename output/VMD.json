At\nthis time, all participants are in a listen only mode. A question and answer session will\nfollow the formal presentation. If anyone should require operator assistance during the\nconference, you can press star, zero on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this\nconference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Todd Zehnder, COO. Thank\nyou. You may begin.\nTodd Zehnder\nAll right. Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today.\nPlease note that our remarks in this conference call may include forward-looking\nstatements under the U.S. federal securities laws or forward-looking information under\napplicable Canadian securities legislation, which we collectively refer to as forward-\nlooking statements. Such statements reflect the company's current views and intentions\nwith respect to future results or events and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties,\nwhich could cause the actual results or events to vary from those indicated in forward-\nlooking statements. Examples of such risks and uncertainties are discussed in our\ndisclosure documents filed with the SEC or the security regulatory authorities in certain\nprovinces of Canada. Because of these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place\nundue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nThe forward-looking statements made in this conference call are made as of today, and\nthe company undertakes no obligations to update or revise any forward-looking\nstatements, except as required by law.\nThe third quarter financial news release, including the related financial statements, are\navailable on the SEC's website.\nI'll now turn it over to VieMed's CEO, Casey Hoyt, to get things started.\nCasey Hoyt\nOkay. Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us\ntoday. The third quarter results exceeded both our projections and expectations, driven\nby continued organic growth in our core businesses as well as continued growth from\nrecent M&A activity, leading to strong year-over-year and sequential growth in net\nrevenue.\nOur third quarter net revenue established yet another company record of $58 million,\nexceeding the top end of our guidance and establishing a pathway to a strong finish in\n2024.\nI want to acknowledge and thank our incredible VieMed family, which now numbers more\nthan 1,150 employees. Their dedication to our Live Your Life mission and their relentless\nfocus on patient satisfaction and operational performance will enable a strong finish to\n2024.\nYou've heard us talk about earning the trusted place in the home for some time. I want to\ndrill down on that a bit more this morning and why it matters. VieMed is substantially\ndifferentiated from HME providers to the point that we believe that even the description\nhome medical equipment doesn't fully capture exactly what we're doing in the home and\nthe value we're proving out every day to patients, providers and payers. It's clear that\nthere is a trend of providing clinical care in the home. Patients want to be treated in the\ncomfort and safety of their home, hospitals and health systems want to avoid\nreadmissions, and payers know that the costs are lower in the home versus an\ninstitutional setting.\nImproving outcomes, patient satisfaction and operational efficiency are the pillars for\ndelivering care in the home. VieMed has been a leader since day one with our high-touch,\nhigh-technology care model.\nWhat's become clear to us is that, in today's environment, patient satisfaction is more\ncritical than ever. A focus on patient outcomes and personalized care, not to mention\noffering support to address patient concerns, becomes increasingly important, particularly\nwhen it comes to patient compliance. Utilizing advanced tools, such as our proprietary\nPage 2 of 13\nEngage platform, can boost provider communication and care coordination. These\nsolutions need to be scalable to streamline operations and provide the accurate data\nultimately needed for value-based care.\nThis isn't a future state we're talking about at VieMed. This is the model that we have\nbeen deploying with our RTEs at the center of everything we do in the home. It's the\nreason why we've allocated capital investments in technology, recruiting, training and the\nprovision of social services we offer to our patients. We're ready for where the industry\nshould be going, and we expect to continue to lead it.\nOn the regulatory front, we're seeing some positive signs of support for the industry.\nVieMed has been a leading advocate for the reconsideration of NCD 280.1, emphasizing\nobjective and comprehensive coverage policies for NIV therapy.\nWe believe that the request for the NCD is another signal we've seen from CMS that they\nare serious about holding MA plans accountable for appropriate guidelines to deliver\nclinical care. The majority of comments submitted on the NCD have been positive, and\nwe think this is a real opportunity for the industry to serve those in need and facilitate\ncontinued expansion. The reason we've been proactive on the NCD is that establishing\nclear and consistent guidelines will create a stable business environment for providers\nand reduce uncertainty for patients.\nThe research supports the efficacy of the NIV, resulting in significant reductions in costs,\nhospitalizations and improved patient outcomes. And the data exhibits there is medical\nnecessity for putting patients on the device immediately and improving their quality of life.\nWe've submitted our comments on the NCD and have sponsored or supported much of\nthe research cited in other comments. We'll continue to provide a leadership role through\nVieMed and through the industry trade associations.\nI'd also like to highlight that there has been some recent movement on the 75-25\nreimbursement relief. Recall that this rate adjustment for certain products in certain areas\nwould increase Medicare reimbursements for providers serving those areas. This isn't\ndead by any means. It adds positive momentum with some recent legislative support, and\nit should be backed up for consideration at the end of the year. As we've noted before,\nrestoration of this relief would be positive for the financial performance in 2025.\nLet me now turn to some brief updates on the business. The continued strength of our\nvent business was on display again this quarter with a 4.3% sequential increase in active\nvent patients. That sequential growth is usually a leading indicator for future quarters and\nPage 3 of 13\nreinforces the positive outlook we have on the business. The 400-plus increase in vent\npatients we've experienced in both Q2 and Q3 is as good as we’ve produced in a number\nof years.\nOne of the reasons our vent growth has been so strong is the operational overhaul we\ncompleted earlier in the year. Those efforts resulted in internal processes driving higher\nvent utilization and vent patient billings.\nThe new sales structure we put in place and discussed last quarter is having an impact,\nas well. With an 18% increase in average monthly setups per sales rep compared with\nwhat they were producing prior to the implementation, we've been accelerating the\nrecruitment of sales reps to maintain our industry-leading organic growth. We expect to\nhave more to report on this effort in Q4.\nIn our sleep business, all I can say is what a difference a quarter makes in terms of the\noverall narrative around GLP-1 drugs. Based on what we've seen from ResMed and\nothers so far, we believe it's pretty conclusive that GLP-1s are not impeding the growth\nof the sleep business. As we noted before, in fact, it appears to be bringing more patients\ninto treatment for sleep apnea and other disorders as they lose weight.\nDespite the increasing use of GLP-1 therapies for weight loss, both obesity and sleep\napnea rates continue to climb. For patients with moderate to severe obesity-related sleep\napnea, research consistently shows that combining PAP therapy with weight loss\nprovides greater benefits than either treatment alone.\nReal-world data reveals that OSA patients prescribed GLP-1 medications are 10.8% more\nlikely to start PAP therapy with significantly higher adherence rates, evidenced by\nincreased PAP resupply orders at one and two years post setup.\nThe improvement in sentiment and the increasing amount of published research lines up\nwith what we're seeing in our business. We're seeing sequential growth in CPAP units,\npatients, resupply orders and home sleep tests. Even though sleep is currently\ncontributing 17% of our total revenue as of Q3, we believe we've only scratched the\nsurface of what this business can contribute to our overall growth.\nWe're still on track with our East Alabama joint venture integration plans. We've made\nincremental progress each of the last two quarters, and as this is our test case for future\nJVs like this, we are easing our way into our growth plans. We outlined a plan for\nannualized revenue of approximately $4 million when we made this acquisition, and that's\nthe path we're on. We expect to have more to report out on the JV at the year-end.\nPage 4 of 13\nOur M&A pipeline remains robust with a focus on adding complementary services that\ncould expand our core businesses. These new opportunities could also build on the\nstrong relationships we've already earned with patients and could enhance our value to\nproviders and payers through greater scale and efficiencies. Overall, I'm pleased with\nhow we've executed throughout this quarter. We've regularly challenged our team to hit\nour strategic goals, and they've delivered.\nWith record-breaking quarters in 2024 on top of our highest EBITDA quarter ever in Q3,\nwe have built up a lot of positive momentum for the fourth quarter that will feed into 2025.\nThe increasing vent patient and sleep patient growth, together with our sleep resupply\nbusiness, provide a strong base of organic growth. We have no intention of letting up. We\nare laser-focused internally on finishing on a strong note, which will provide the exit\nvelocity for a stronger year in 2025.\nFor more on our operational and financial results for the quarter, I'll turn the call back over\nto Todd.\nTodd Zehnder\nAll right. Thanks, Casey. In reviewing the financial results, all figures are in U.S. dollars,\nand the full results have been made available on the SEC website. I'll focus my prepared\ncomments on providing some additional color behind our strong performance. You'll\nnotice we added some new disclosures this quarter around our sleep therapy patient\ncount and sleep resupply orders. Based on feedback we've received from the investment\ncommunity, we've been exploring some incremental disclosures that can assist in\nmeasuring our performance. Our goal is to build on these disclosures over the next couple\nof quarters.\nThe new company record for revenue this quarter and the 17% increase was driven\nalmost entirely by organic growth with inorganic or acquired revenue accounting for $1.1\nmillion of that year-over-year increase. Our revenue increased 6% on a sequential basis\nwith inorganic or acquired revenue accounting for only $327,000.\nThe organic growth story at VieMed is alive and well, and in our mind, provides a high\nlevel of predictability of growth in a very capital-efficient manner.\nOur core business in vents accounted for 55% of the revenue this quarter with sleep\nincreasing to 17%. Our oxygen and staffing businesses continue to grow, as well, with\nPage 5 of 13\nthose each contributing roughly 10% of this quarter's revenue. We're also making\nincremental improvements with the East Alabama Medical Center JV.\nGross margin was fairly consistent with the last two quarters at 59.3%. Recall, that's down\nyear-over-year due to a change in product and service mix as sleep, oxygen and staffing\ncontinue to grow at a faster rate. Slightly above and below the 60% mark is where this\ncurrent business mix should be.\nThe EBITDA margin for the quarter was 24.1%, which is up from 23.3% in the second\nquarter and compares favorably with 24.5% a year ago. We've made substantial\nimprovement each quarter, and we're aiming for another strong performance in the fourth\nquarter.\nWe've done a really good job of managing SG&A with these expenses down to 46% of\nrevenue this quarter compared with 48% in the second quarter and 48% a year ago. We\nare investing in new sales talent, improving -- and improving our patient experience in the\nhome.\nThe continued reduction in SG&A as a percentage of revenue is a reflection of good cost\ncontrols, but also the leverage we're getting from better productivity and efficiencies from\noperational and process improvements that have been put in place.\nAs expected, our gross CapEx this quarter was higher than normal, driven by our strategic\nacceleration of the vent exchange initiative. For the quarter, we invested approximately\n$11 million on CapEx, primarily on various respiratory equipment for our patients.\nOffsetting these purchases was approximately $6 million of related sales and exchange\nproceeds, putting our net cash CapEx for the quarter at approximately $5 million.\nWe expect to sell more vents over the next several quarters, but the pace and amount\nwill be determined by the remediation process established by Philips and the related\ngovernmental agencies.\nWe have once again funded our CapEx out of discretionary cash flow and continue to\nmanage the business in order to drop free cash flow onto the balance sheet. Our\npercentage of net CapEx to EBITDA was at 36% this quarter compared with 64% in the\nsecond quarter and 58% a year ago. We will continue to update our free cash flow\ndisclosure on an annual basis.\nPage 6 of 13\nSimilar to last quarter, we recorded a small gain of $0.5 million that was primarily driven\nby the Trilogy return program. We would expect to continue reporting these gains until\nthe project is completed, likely next year.\nThe balance sheet remains in great shape as we paid down our line of credit by $2 million\nduring the quarter, giving us $55 million available on our credit facilities along with a $30\nmillion accordion if needed for an attractive use of proceeds. We built up cash by $2.5\nmillion to $11.3 million as of quarter end and improved working capital to $11.3 million.\nThe tremendous opportunity we have to upgrade our vent fleet through the Philips\nbuyback is enabling us to prioritize investing in our organic growth. The increased liquidity\nalso gives us the flexibility to consider additional M&A in the future that can be\ncomplementary to our growth.\nThe momentum in the business is demonstrated in our outlook for the fourth quarter. We\nare anticipating net revenue in the range of $59.7 million to $60.9 million. The midpoint of\nthat range implies sequential growth of 4.0% and a year-over-year increase of 18.9%.\nThis outlook is based on sequential growth in vent patients, continued contribution from\nour sleep business, along with anticipated growth in our other products.\nThere aren't too many moving parts for us coming into the fourth quarter. Without\nassuming any material diversion from the margin profile we've experienced most of this\nyear and the typical liquidity ramp we see during the fourth quarter, we believe it's realistic\nto expect a solid adjusted EBITDA finish to the year, as well.\nWith the improvement we've made every quarter this year from operational and sales\nefficiencies, driving organic growth, self-funding CapEx through cash flow and improving\nthe balance sheet, it's critical to maintain that momentum and operational excellence\nduring the fourth quarter. We're confident that we will, which should position us very well\nfor a good year in 2025.\nThank you for joining us today. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open\nthe floor up for questions.\nOperator\nThank you. At this time, we’ll be conducting a question and answer session. If you’d like\nto ask a question, please press star, one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone\nwill indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star, two if you’d like to\nremove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may\nPage 7 of 13\nbe necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment please\nwhile we poll for questions.\nOur first question comes from Brooks O'Neil with Lake Street Capital Markets. Please\nproceed with your question.\nBrooks O'Neil\nThank you very much, and good morning, guys. Congratulations on the terrific progress\nyou're making. To be honest, (inaudible) you guys provided such a great overview, I only\nhave one significant question, and I probably should know the answer to this before I\neven ask it. But, Casey provided a nice overview of the positive shift in the regulatory\nenvironment. I'm curious if what they're talking about involves any increased\nreimbursement, or maybe I should say any change in reimbursement, or is it just clarifying\nsome of the usage guidelines and whatnot? Thank you.\nCasey Hoyt\nNo problem. There's two regulatory -- not issues, but things that I commented on. 75-25\nis a rate relief reimbursement fluctuation. Brooks, I'm not sure if you recall, but back during\nCOVID, we got rate relief, and what they did at the beginning of last year is they recalled\nthat relief. And so the 75-25 movement was a rural demographic mix split that they were\ngoing back and looking at the areas that we received relief and seeing if we could get that\nrecalled basically. That's not dead. There's a lot of movement behind it. It's about $140\nmillion lift for CMS to recall that, which is not that big. We represent less than 2% of the\nCMS Medicare spend as an industry.\nSo we got some legislative support behind us, and we'll be hopeful at the end of the year\nto maybe recover that. But that would just be a net win for us.\nThe other is the NCD comment. That's no relation to any kind of reimbursement shift, but\nit's just good policy to develop clear clinical guidelines. CMS is kind of acknowledging that\nthey're a little too vague right now, and it's allowing MA to make up their own rules, for\nlack of a better description\nAnd so they're honing in on that to where MA follows their clinical guidelines. And in order\nto do that, they’ve got to go into a comment period and ask for all comments, which there\nwas no better time to have all of the research buttoned up that we've invested into over\nthe last five to seven years to be able to kind of comment through the lens of data and\npublish research and rather than our opinion as a vent provider. It was extremely powerful,\nand we saw a lot of our peers and industry associations follow suit to our comments and\nlatch on to them, as well.\nPage 8 of 13\nSo the industry was reasonably aligned with all of their commentary as it related to this,\nso CMS should have some powerful data to write some clear guidelines here in the future,\nwhich would be a major win for our entire industry.\nBrooks O'Neil\nGreat. Fantastic. Congratulations again on the terrific progress.\nCasey Hoyt\nThanks, Brooks.\nTodd Zehnder\nThanks, Brooks.\nOperator\nAs a reminder, if you’d like to ask a question, please press star, one on your telephone\nkeypad. One moment while we poll for questions.\nOur next question comes from Doug Cooper with Beacon Securities. Please proceed with\nyour question.\nDoug Cooper\nHey, good afternoon, guys. Nice quarter. Todd, I just wanted to focus in on the -- I guess,\nthe increased disclosure around the sleep business. I just want to make sure I got -- I\nunderstand the disclosure here. So I guess it's the fourth bullet point in your press release,\nthe company increased its sleep therapy patient count by 11% sequentially to 19,478.\nAnd then the company also increased its resupply orders by 9.7% sequentially to 22,143.\nSo there's, let's call it just round figures, 20,000 patients in your sleep program today. And\nthen -- but there's 22,000 -- it looks almost like there's more people in the resupply\nprogram than you have actual patients. How should I read that?\nTodd Zehnder\nThose are mutually exclusive, Doug. So the sleep therapy patients are the ones that are\non PAP -- like we're actually renting them the machine right now. The resupply (inaudible)\ndeveloped over the last, call it, five to ten years. And so they're no longer in their generally,\nwhat, 13-month cap period, and so they're just on resupply. So you should add those\ntogether effectively to get to what -- the patients that we serve during the quarter, which\nwas roughly 42,000.\nDoug Cooper\nPage 9 of 13\n42,000. Okay. And then so the resupply order, that's 22,000 -- is that three times a year-\n-\nTodd Zehnder\n--It depends. I think on average, we're a little -- we're probably closer to two, two and a\nhalf times per year. It depends on insurance companies, and it just depends on patient\npreference on how often they reorder. But ours is between two and two and a half as a\ntotal company.\nDoug Cooper\nOkay. And just on -- when I relate it back to your financials, I see the line item other\ndurable medical equipment rentals of $12.5 million. That's directly related to the 42,000\npatients.\nTodd Zehnder\nThat would have the 22,000 patients -- or excuse me -- the 20,000 patients that are renting\nthe machine. The resupply would be service revenue. But additionally, on that -- the other\nrentals, you would have your oxygen patients, everything else, vests, nebulizers any --\njust the whole continuum of products.\nDoug Cooper\nOkay. And then, finally, just the other equipment sales, that would be the resupply\nprogram, the $8.4 million?\nTodd Zehnder\nYes.\nDoug Cooper\nIs there anything else in that number other than the resupply program, or is that\npredominant--\nTodd Zehnder\n--It's primarily resupply, but there is other things in there.\nDoug Cooper\nOkay. Okay. And then to your point, Casey, the 469 patients you added on the vent\nprogram, I think I went back and looked -- this might be -- in fact, it might be the biggest\nlift I've seen on an absolute basis. Maybe -- well, I went back five years. There might have\nbeen one quarter where you added more than that, and there was 455 in the -- in quarter\nPage 10 of 13\ntwo. What do you attribute to -- is it just increased sales, or are the referring docs are they\nbecoming more comfortable with the program?\nCasey Hoyt\nI mean, I really attribute it to our training program, our restructure of the sales force. It's -\n- we're doing more with less. And these guys are extremely productive. They're polished.\nThey're more educated. We have the right people in the right spots throughout the\ncountry. It wasn't an easy movement. We moved 12 folks into upper -- middle\nmanagement and just restructured the entire sales force.\nI would say that we still -- and we started talking about this at the beginning of the year,\nbut we've yet to really benefit from the recruiting, the localized recruiting benefits that are\non the ground just because we've been so laser-focused on training our folks up.\nBut that's the next phase of the sales restructure is really recruiting people localized in\ntheir backyards. And we have the recipe now for training. We have the recipe right now\nfor finding the right people. Now it's 2024, and -- I mean, Q4 and 2025 is going to be about\nrecruiting and finding these guys and incrementally growing. So we're super excited about\nwhere we sit right now.\nDoug Cooper\nOkay. And just finally, on the M&A side, you said it's -- the pipeline is looking pretty robust.\nAny color on what -- is it in the sleep? I'm assuming it wouldn't be vents, but would it be\nsleep? Would it be outside of the respiratory space? Maybe just more color on kind of\nsize of the companies you might be looking at?\nTodd Zehnder\nWe're not always going to be leaning towards respiratory, Doug. We're not exclusive to\nthat. I mean, we will look at other businesses. We've looked at other businesses. We\ngenerally have said that the size of the HMP acquisition, which is a really good size, which\nwas that $25 million to $30 million range. But we'll do smaller deals as necessary, or we'll\nlook at larger deals. So we've got a little bit of everything in there right now, but it just feels\nlike we're getting more inbound calls over the last, call it, three months than we had the\nprior couple of years.\nDoug Cooper\nRight, right. Okay, that’s it for me, guys. Terrific work.\nTodd Zehnder\nAll right, Doug, thanks.\nPage 11 of 13\nCasey Hoyt\nThank you.\nOperator\nOur next question is from Ilya Zubkov with Freedom Broker. Please proceed with your\nquestion.\nIlya Zubkov\nYeah, good afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions. So my first question is on\nthe EBITDA margin expansion. I see that adjusted EBITDA margin is expanding from\nquarter-to-quarter this year, and I was wondering if the primary driver for that is permanent\nlike economy of scale? And if yes, could it be in effect next year, as well?\nTodd Zehnder\nYeah. I mean, generally, our EBITDA margins do get stronger as the year goes on. If you\nlook at it just quarter-over-quarter, we generally see higher margins. But the answer is\nyes, we do see some efficiencies that have come with scale. The reduction year-over-\nyear is just due to the revenue composition. As vents become a slightly smaller\npercentage of our revenue, it's a challenge to keep our margins flat, but we were pretty\nclose with that, and that just shows that everything across the board is getting a little bit\nmore efficient with scale and we get the leverage of becoming a bigger company.\nSo a lot of moving parts and pieces, but we're extremely excited about the overall metric.\nThat's why, in my prepared remarks, I talked about revenue as a percentage -- or excuse\nme -- SG&A as a percentage of revenue. Because the gross margin is very product\ndriven, the G&A is something that we have more control over and the scalability that\nyou're referring to.\nIlya Zubkov\nGreat. Thank you. And another one on the current progress in replacement of recalled\nventilators - so I see that CapEx is growing, and I wanted to ask if you expect further\nincrease in CapEx in nearest quarters, and what is the expected timing for full --\nreplacement of recalled ventilators?\nTodd Zehnder\nYes. I mean, like I said in the earlier part, we definitely saw an increase this quarter, but\nwe're starting to measure it on a net CapEx because the third quarter was where we really\ngot into a groove of selling -- or distributing our vents back to Philips. And obviously, our\nvent patient count is growing, so we have to replace those vents with CapEx. It's why you\nPage 12 of 13\nsaw us very deliberately disclose net CapEx, and we're very proud that I think the net\nCapEx as a percentage of EBITDA is probably the lowest it's ever been in our corporate\nhistory.\nI would expect that number to continue to be very large this quarter. And very likely, it will\nstay like that through at least the middle of next year. We're kind of waiting on Philips and\nthe FDA and anybody else that is going to be needed to make a decision of when they\ncan actually remediate some of their vents versus us just selling them back to them. But\nwe'll be working in conjunction with them to see how that all shakes out to determine\nwhether we keep selling at the rate that we are right now or maybe we send some back\nto be able to stay on patients and so forth.\nSo it's a little early for us to say how long it will take us to finish, but it will definitely go into\nnext year because we still have a pretty significant fleet out there.\nIlya Zubkov\nAll right. Thank you very much.\nTodd Zehnder\nThank you.\nOperator\nWe have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call\nback over to management for closing comments.\nTodd Zehnder\nAll right, we want to thank everybody for listening in. And if you have follow-up questions,\nplease reach out to us, and we look forward to talking to everyone. Have a great day.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we\nthank you for your participation.\nPage 13 of 13"

We are incredibly\nhappy with our results and our opportunities for continued growth. This remarkable growth is a\ntestament to our robust operational performance and the unwavering dedication of our team. Our\nVieMed family continues to expand, now numbering 1,121 employees as of June 30, and which\nincludes our talented team at East Alabama Home Med following our acquisition on April 1st.\nOur HomeMed integration is on track, and we are close to the point where we were moving past\nprocess changes and can start to focus on growth for East Alabama Medical Center and VieMed.\nWe expect to realize further growth throughout the back half of the year and are really more\nexcited about the framework we have created for future JV opportunities through this transaction.\nNew ventilator setups are incredibly strong with active vent patients growing by 4.4% during the\nquarter, compared to the March patient count. A major component of our successful quarterly\nperformance is the impressive results from our sales force restructuring initiatives. We have\nrefined our approach, enhanced developmental conversations, identified and strategically\ninvested in the right talent earlier in the training life cycle. New incentive plans and alignment of\nperformance targets have also contributed to these results. The impact of our new sales structure\nis evident with a 15% increase in average monthly setups per sales rep compared to the beginning\nof the year.\nNew reps are hitting their sales target faster and at higher rates than ever before, giving us\ntremendous optimism about the next 18 to 24 months of ventilator growth. We are now at the\nphase of the sales restructuring where management is in place, existing sales reps are producing\nat higher levels, and we will be accelerating recruiting efforts throughout the back half of the year.\nMarket penetration for noninvasive ventilation remains in the sub-10% range and we are\nobserving considerable demand widespread throughout the country. Our Industry Association A\nHome Care recently engaged ops in DaVanzo (sp) for a comprehensive noninvasive ventilation\nto quantify the differences in outcomes and treatment cases for patients receiving an IV therapy\nversus those who don't.\nThis research will also analyze the experiences of Medicare Advantage patients. We believe this\nnew study will further educate payers on the substantial advantages of noninvasive ventilation,\nreinforcing the significant benefits already highlighted by existing research. As many of you know,\nVieMed was a pioneer in the noninvasive ventilation market, resulting in a fleet with a number of\naging ventilators. The recent Philips recall of these older machines has presented a unique\nopportunity to replace these devices and alleviate the need for future servicing.\nWe've entered into an agreement with Philips to buy back a large number of our affected vents.\nBy leveraging substantial volume purchase discounts with manufacturers of new ventilators, we\ncan use the proceeds from the buyback to significantly reduce the average age of our VIP (sp)\nfleet without negative impacts on our overall cash flows and P&L.\nOur sleep business continues to experience strong organic growth, and it now represents 15% of\nour revenue mix. The GLP-1 craze may be contributing to this increase in sleep volume as more\nfolks are addressing their health concerns at higher rates around the country. Sleep has grown at\na double-digit quarterly rate over March. CPAP and sleep lines continue to thrive, reflecting the\nenduring demand and effectiveness of positive airway pressure solutions.\nOn the technology front, we have been beta testing machine learning tools that we view will further\nimprove our processes and provide opportunities to enhance our patient care capabilities. These\ntechnological and software developments are helping us to accelerate fulfillment times and\noptimize claim processes. Furthermore, proprietary Engage platform continues to aggregate\nvaluable patient data and create workflow efficiencies for our RTs in the field. We expect to realize\nPage 2 of 9\nreal efficiencies and opportunities in the coming quarters as a result of the technology\ninvestments.\nOn the payer and regulatory front, we have swiftly and successfully migrated all of our payers\naway from Change Healthcare. We can now confidently say that we expect no material impact in\ntimely filing denials as a result of the Changed Healthcare cyber-attack. Affected claims are being\nprocessed on the alternative clearing houses. AAHome Care is also continuing to push for the\nreinstatement of 75-25 blended rates, which, if successful, has the potential to further improve\nmargins.\nWe are also experiencing behavior shifts and payers adjusting to more favorable medical policies.\nAs a result of regulatory enforcement and voluntary compliance, there are a number of payers\nmodifying step therapy approaches to trying and failing by level devices before authorizing\nventilation. These changes stand to reduce the burden patients experience on being placed on\ninferior treatments for chronic respiratory failure. These positive medical policy trends also help\nour clinicians fast track VIP therapy and ultimately improve overall access to care in a timely\nmanner.\nRecently announced mergers and acquisitions in the home health care sector underscore the\nrobust appeal for the industry. For instance, Owens & Minor's $1.4 billion pending transaction to\nacquire Rotech, a large national HME provider highlights the there's significant attractiveness. We\nview this development as a testament to the industry's potential rather than a threat to the\nVieMed's competitors vents.\nOur M&A pipeline remains active, reflecting our continued interest in acquisitions and promising\ngrowth opportunities. At VieMed, we are incredibly well positioned within our market as a leading\nprovider of complex respiratory care. Ventilation services continue to be at our foundation and\npresent an amazing opportunity for profitable growth in this sector. With more financial and\noperational updates on the quarter, I'll now hand the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, Todd\nZehnder. Todd?\nTodd Zehnder\nThanks, Casey. In reviewing the financial results, all figures are in U.S. dollars and the full results\nhave been made available on the SEC website. Our core business generated net revenue of $55\nmillion during the second quarter of 2024 as compared to net revenues of $43.3 million in the\nsecond quarter of 2023, which equates to a 27% increase. Our revenue increased approximately\n9% sequentially, all of which except $900,000 was organic, which is an extremely strong growth\nrate.\nOperationally, the first half of the year has been strong, and we have worked through the majority\nof the first quarter and Change Healthcare headwinds. We continue to remain committed and\noptimistic that we will be able to continue our high organic growth rates. Our second quarter\nrevenue from vents was approximately 56% as compared to approximately 60% in the second\nquarter of 2023. Our gross and EBITDA margins are still strong, and we continue to be successful\nin managing our cost structure this year and is showing in both gross and EBITDA contribution.\nOur gross and EBITDA margins during the quarter came in at 60% and 23%, respectively. Our\nsecond quarter gross and EBITDA amounts came in at $32.9 million and $12.8 million,\nrespectively. Our SG&A for the quarter totaled approximately $26.5 million as compared to $20.6\nmillion in the second quarter of 2023. G&A as a percentage of revenue decreased sequentially\nPage 3 of 9\nfrom 49% during the first quarter of 24% to 48% during the second quarter of '24 and continues\nour theme of managing our G&A well.\nWe will continue to manage our G&A costs and also remain committed to invest in our patient\nand employee experiences and once again, expect to grow revenues at a faster rate than\nexpenses. For the quarter, we invested approximately $8.9 million on patient CapEx, primarily on\nvarious respiratory products. The gross CapEx is higher than normal this quarter because we\nhave begun to sell back some of our fleet to Philips in conjunction with their recall and, hence, are\nbuying new vents from other manufacturers.\nWe sold back approximately $2.6 million of vents during the second quarter that should be\nconsidered an offset to our CapEx number. That context to this, during the second quarter, Philips\nbegan offering event buyback program in relation to the trilogy vents that have been on recall.\nWe're utilizing the buyback program for a portion of our fleet and plan to remediate a portion after\nthe process is fully developed by Philips and the related governmental agencies. We are waiting\nto hear when the remediation can begin and will continue to monetize a portion of our fleet over\nthe next year or so.\nWe have recorded some gains as a result of this project during the quarter and expect to do so\nuntil it is completed. Offsetting some of that gain are two unique items that impacted net income,\nbut not EBITDA for the quarter. We took reserves related to a former vendor filing bankruptcy and\nan amount that we were owed from them as well as an impairment on one of our investments\ndown to fair market value. The total amount before tax benefits of these two items was\napproximately $2.2 million. We have once again funded our CapEx out of discretionary cash flow\nand continue to manage the business in order to drop free cash flow onto the balance sheet.\nOur percentage of net CapEx to EBITDA was healthy at 49%. We will continue to update our free\ncash flow disclosure on an annual basis as we discussed last quarter. As an update to the cash\ncollections being impacted by the Change Healthcare cybersecurity issue, we have fully restored\nconnectivity to all of our payers through alternative clearing houses, and we made up a significant\namount of the deferred collections during the second quarter.\nWe are still working through finalizing the cash collections on the remaining claims and estimate\nthat we still have approximately $4 million of increased AR on June 30 as a result of this issue.\nWe are confident that this project will be completed during the third quarter, with a substantial\nportion of the impacted amounts already collected in July. Our capital allocation opportunities\nremain consistent and that our organic growth is the highest priority.\nOur inorganic growth, debt paydown, and vent equity buybacks continue to round out those\npriorities as evidenced by our JV signed on April 1 and the $3 million paydown of our revolver on\nJuly 31. We ended the quarter in a net cash positive position once again and have total long-term\ndebt of $8.7 million. Our working capital at the end of the quarter was $13.1 million.\nMoving on to the third quarter. We have provided net revenue guidance in the $56.5 million to\n$57.7 million range related to our core business. The midpoint of our net revenue guidance is up\n16% over the core revenue in the third quarter of 2023 and is once again showing impressive\nsequential growth. We remain active in our discussions with investors and analysts and once\nagain have seen our U.S. institutional ownership increase over the last couple of quarters. We\nremain excited about telling our story of growth and see the current market as an opportunity to\nattract new investors. At this time, I'll turn it over to Casey to wrap things up.\nPage 4 of 9\nCasey Hoyt\nThanks, Todd. As we look back on the second quarter of 2024, we are proud of the robust growth\nwe've achieved and the solid foundation we've built for future success. The opportunities\npresented by the Philips recall and the ongoing success of our sales force restructuring initiatives\nhighlights our ability to adapt and thrive in a dynamic market environment. We're excited about\nthe potential for future growth in our core product categories. Our advancements in technology\nand machine learning underscore our commitment to innovation and improve patient care.\nOur strong financial performance and the swift integration of East Alabama HomeMed are a\ntestament to our team's strategic vision and operational excellence. Our proactive approach to\nregulatory and payer challenges demonstrates our dedication to staying ahead of industry trends\nand ensuring the best outcomes for our patients and partners. We are deeply appreciative of the\ncontinued support and trust from our investors, analysts, employees, and partners. Your\nconfidence in VieMed fuels our drive to excel and pushes the boundaries of what's possible in\nrespiratory care. Thank you for joining us today. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will\nnow open the floor up for further questions.\nOperator\nIf you would like to ask a question at this time, please press “*” then the number “1” on your\ntelephone keypad now. You will be placed in the queue in the order received. Please be prepared\nto ask your question when prompted. Once again, if you would like to ask a question at this time,\nplease press “*” then the number “1” on your telephone keypad. Your first question comes from\nBrooks O'Neil with Lake Street Capital. Your line is open.\nBrooks O'Neil\nThank you very much. Good morning, guys. Terrific quarter. I have a few questions. I guess I'd\nlike to start—it feels to me like you're in a super target-rich environment. I might make an analogy.\nIt feels a little bit like you're looking at a flock of ducks coming over the duck line. And I'm curious,\ndo you think about that as taking your shot down and hoping you hit something or would you say\nit's a little different than that, that you're really trying to prioritize the best opportunities and take\ncareful shots at each one?\nCasey Hoyt\nWell, to stay on your duck analogy, we're trying to get three shots per man out of each flock. So\nwe're being really efficient with how we do things, and that kind of ties back to the sales\nrestructuring, Brooks. Yes. I mean we see it as a target-rich really complex respiratory for all of\nour products right now, include vest and vents and even sleep.\nTheir target-rich environments and all of our sales folks are trained to cross-sell across all of those\nlines. We're getting the production out of them, thanks to increased training and improved\nmanagement. And now we feel really confident about our management team out there, and so\nwe're going to crank up a lot more fuel in the fire on recruiting for not just the back half of the year,\nbut back half and beyond.\nTodd Zehnder\nAnd I will just add one thing to the duck analogy, we don't miss very often. And we're going to\nstay consistent with that theme that we're very careful where we take our shots and we're good\nat them, generally. So we're patient, but we're prudent.\nBrooks O'Neil\nPage 5 of 9\nThat all makes sense. Let me ask you about the most recent thing, the JV that you've completed\nand you mentioned a framework. Do you see a lot of opportunities for replicating that structure\nand that opportunity in other markets or with other partners?\nCasey Hoyt\nYeah, I mean we've gotten close with some. I think really where we're at with it, Brooks, is I'm\nhoping to have some real world data to present to our next few opportunities, showing the success\nof HomeMed and how we've been able to improve their bottom line and their efficiencies and so\non and so forth. So we expect to probably have more meat on the bone for our value prop pitch\nto others by year's end. And from there, we can, a, circle back with some of the ones that we've\nbeen close with and then, b, bring it to the masses. But right now, I think we're in the proving the\nmodel out mode, if you will.\nBrooks O'Neil\nAbsolutely. Let me ask just one more. It sounds like the Philips recall and buyback an absolute\nhome run for you guys in that you can sell them back some used equipment probably in a\nfavorable way and redeploy the capital in new equipment that is going to have a 10-year life. Am\nI thinking about that right? Or is there any downside to you guys with what's going on there?\nTodd Zehnder\nNo, you think about it correct. I’d say it's a project that we've been working on. We're—we probably\nsold about 15% of our fleet back already. We're not exactly sure if we're going to sell the whole\nthing back. We're just working through that. But exactly correct in that we're able to replace the\nfleet at a cost advantage situation. And at this point, we've been able to record an accounting gain\nas a result of it. It's an operational project, but our team has folded in really well. Philips has been\na good partner to work with on it. And thus far, it has been extremely positive and nothing, but\ngood for the company and the patients at that point.\nBrooks O'Neil\nSure. Well, great. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Congratulations and keep up all\nthe good work.\nCasey Hoyt\nThanks, Brooks.\nOperator\nOnce again, to ask a question, press “*” then the number “1” on your telephone keypad. Your next\nquestion comes from Ilya Zubkov with Freedom Broker. Your line is open.\nIlya Zubkov\nHey, good morning and thank you for taking my question. Congrats with the strong quarter. I have\na question on the equipment and supply sales dynamics. One of the mentioned growth drivers of\nthis segment is the sleep resupply program. And I'm wondering how much does this program\ncontribute to the segment's revenue? And could you elaborate on the quarterly revenue dynamics\nin this segment as well? Because I see that the revenue is rebounding significantly in Q2\ncomparing to the previous two quarters.\nTodd Zehnder\nThe specific line item that you're asking about is equipment and supply sales, is that correct?\nIlya Zubkov\nPage 6 of 9\nYes. Correct.\nTodd Zehnder\nOkay. It's mainly due to us increasing our sleep business over the last, call it, two years, but then\nespecially last year when we bought out—or we bought HMP and then our own VieMed sleep\ngrowth being so strong in the last, call it, one to two years. The primary amount of that is related\nto our sleep resupply program. And if you're familiar with the sleep business, that is really the\ndriver of your long-term value creation in the sleep business. It’s the patients who need new\nsupplies every three or six months or whatever it is.\nSo as we've stacked on thousands and thousands of new patients into the resupply program, that\nnumber is going to continue to grow. It has zero CapEx associated with it, which is another good\npiece of our business. It's all cash flow. And so we fully expect that line item to continue to grow\nover the coming quarters.\nIlya Zubkov\nOkay. Thank you. That is helpful. And I have one more on service revenue. There is a significant\nramp up in service revenue this year due to the staffing offering and I'm curious is there any\nseasonality in this segment that can cause quarter-to-quarter fluctuations of the revenue in the\nfuture.\nTodd Zehnder\nNo, not really. Those could come and go in the future, but we don't see anything large falling off\nin the near term. That's really our health care staffing division. And as we've expanded that group\nover the last several years, I mean, we just stood that up organically about three years ago.\nSo as they continue to go out there and explain our value proposition and what we can do. We've\ngotten some new contracts with some states around the country. And that's just—while it's not\nseasonal, it could have terms. But at this point, once again, we see some good growth coming\nfrom that division over the next couple of quarters.\nIlya Zubkov\nOkay, great. Thank you very much.\nTodd Zehnder\nYep. Have a good day.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Doug Cooper with Beacon. Your line is open.\nDoug Cooper\nHey, good morning, guys. And congratulations on a terrific quarter. It's amazing to me in one\nsense that the sector has been hit so hard from a stock price perspective because people think\nthey have a GLP-1s presumably are going to have an impact, but nobody seems to be highlighted\nimpact when they released the results. Rotech by our math sort of (inaudible) EBITDA multiple.\nBased on the—where you guys were before your stockholder this morning, it was trading at 5x\nlast quarter annualized EBITDA, which seems pretty much an all-time low multiple. Like what do\nyou think has to break from an investor perspective?\nTodd Zehnder\nPage 7 of 9\nYou know, it could be a lot to do with the GLP craze, which we've only been able to like explain a\ncouple of different ways. We listen to the larger people out there who are doing studies, and it\nseems nothing has been pulled away from their sleep business or their profitability, which is good.\nThere's companies that are much more focused on it. Sleep makes up roughly 15% of our\nbusiness right now. And as we did last quarter, probably the last few quarters, all we can tell you\nis by no means is our sleep business feeling any pressure. We're not having patients fall off of\nservice in any meaningful way, any higher attrition rates. The sleep business is doing great, and\nwe continue to grow it, and we're happy to keep growing it.\nOutside of that, Doug, the stock market has ebbs and flows as we all know. We're very considerate\nof the stock price. But right now, we spend 99% of our time just continuing to try to grow the\ncompany, try to add to the bottom line. And we think as long as we keep doing that, the stock\nprice is going to come back around at some point.\nDoug Cooper\nDo you guys know what percent of your patients are on GLP-1 drugs on the sleep side?\nTodd Zehnder\nNo, we don't. We haven't dove into that. I know some of our peers have gone out. And I think the\nnumber that they said was maybe 12% of their patients. Once again, we focus our research and\nare kind of digging in on complex respiratory because that's what drives us every day. But I'd\nhave to think that if you hear from ResMed or some of our peers that, that percentage is\nsomewhere around it, then that's probably a pretty decent number for us as well.\nDoug Cooper\nOkay. And maybe just the last one, just based on that, on the private side, the M&A pipeline, what\nare you seeing expectations for guys prices that they want, have those come down over the past\n12, 18 months as well with the value for a publicly traded company?\nTodd Zehnder\nIn our discussions, we're talking through that, that the public multiples can't be significantly\ndepressed from private multiples, but we haven't really gotten to the point where we were with\nlike an HMP and talked that much of Turkey out there. So I think that the market—seeing the\nRotech transaction was good because that means that things are starting to maybe open up\nagain. And I would think a public company multiples out there on that big of a transaction set\nsome sort of marker, but that's somewhat theoretical. And we're going to continue to look for the\nright opportunity and get—if we get to the point where we're talking that level of detail, we're going\nto be prudent about the multiple that we pay.\nDoug Cooper\nAnd maybe just a final one for me. Casey, you referred to the noninvasive vent market, still less\nthan 10% of what could be the applicable market. It's sort of been like that now for a couple of\nyears despite the bunch of research showing the better outcomes. What do you think—is this sort\nof just (inaudible) long here? Or is there a big (inaudible) by the referring physicians that said,\nyeah, I'm going to start referring all my guys to the IVs?\nCasey Hoyt\nYeah. I mean, the way that we break it down, Doug, in our investor presentation, we focus on—\nthe 6% is really the Medicare population. So when we say sub-10%, we're kind of just assuming\nthat the commercial or the private sector is going to make up the rest of that. But we're still in a\ndrastically underserved population.\nPage 8 of 9\nResearch is important in order to get the penetration number up a little bit higher. We continue to\nsee more positive and positive studies, not just the ones that we've accomplished over the years,\nbut others outside forces now proving out the benefits of noninvasive ventilation. It's exciting to\ntake a look now at the Medicare Advantage population.\nThis is the first time that we've had access to those patients. So we'll see how good those guys\nhave been doing on noninvasive vet care. And it's really exciting to see that AAHomeCare, our\nindustry association is the one that's leading the charge now. It's not—for years, we've had to be\nthe leader in the research market, but that's changing, and physicians are jumping in from across\nborders and doing studies now.\nSo it's all positive momentum, everything clinically that we're seeing. And so ultimately, we hope\nthat that research really will drive penetration up to where more folks are considering NIV the gold\nstandard of care and really step therapy and other forms of treatment to try and fail will become\nless of an alternative for medical policies and payers to lean on down the road.\nDoug Cooper\nThanks very much, guys. That’s it for me.\nCasey Hoyt\nBye, Doug. Thanks.\nOperator\nAt this time, there are no further questions in queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to our\npresenters for any further remarks.\nTodd Zehnder\nWe want to thank everybody for listening in today. Follow up if there's any other questions, and\nappreciate your support. Have a great day.\nOperator\nThis concludes the VieMed Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call.

Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call, today. I'm excited\nto share that the first quarter of 2024 has set the solid foundation for Viemed's trajectory, this year.\nOperationally, we are ahead of schedule, despite encountering some cash flow disruptions related to the\nChange Healthcare situation, which we'll cover later on in the call.\nOur revenue grew by an impressive 28%, a testament to the dedication and tireless efforts of our more\nthan 1,000 team members.\nAt Viemed, we recognize that our employees are our most valuable asset, and investing in their\ndevelopment and well-being is paramount to our success.\nOn to the quarter update. Our new sales restructuring is showing tremendous success with sales rep bid\nproduction up over 30% from Q4, putting us ahead of schedule of achieving our internal goals for the\nyear.\nThe structure has proven out to help keep our managers and trainers closer to home, which is making\nthem more effective in the field, working with new and existing reps. We have also been able to support\nmore of their professional growth and ongoing development through offering more mentorship oversight\nand instruction.\nMoreover, we are achieving a healthy work life balance for our people, which is creating an environment\nfor further growth, within our existing infrastructure.\nA lot of good work was completed on our first hospital joint venture project with HomeMed at the East\nAlabama Medical Center, which was completed on April 1. This partnership exemplifies our belief in\nleveraging synergies between Viemed's clinical expertise and business acumen with the immediate\npatient needs, within the hospital networks.\nThis model will account for bringing more service and technology into the home for the patients of East\nAlabama, while cultivating an improved complex respiratory program, inside of the medical center. Our\nteam views this opportunity as a new way of growing our business and is laser focused on making this\nproject a success, one that we will replicate around the country.\nDiscussions with other hospital JVs are actively underway.\nFurthermore, our integration of HMP acquisition is hitting its stride and driving product diversification for\nour business. This product diversification and talent from our HMP team have been a major driver of our\nsuccess, particularly with the hospital joint venture strategy. With the help and expertise of the HMP team,\nwe were able to offer a full suite of DME products to help support the patients in East Alabama, extending\nour offering to go beyond respiratory.\nBy joining forces, we're not only poised to revolutionize care delivery, but also to drive tangible\nimprovements in hospital profitability, while significantly expanding our reach into previously untapped\nmarkets.\nOur merger and acquisition pipeline is gaining traction, and we are starting to see more conversations\nand activities from prospective targets. With that being said, we remain steadfast in our commitment to\norganic growth as a primary driver of our business.\nInComm Conferencing Page 2 of 13 www.incommconferencing.com\nWe still view strategic acquisitions and joint ventures as complementary springboards to our organic\ngrowth strategy. This strategy allows us to focus on making prudent transactions, as we do not have to\nrely on M&A to grow the business.\nWe also focused a good portion of our efforts in Q1 around innovating our care delivery model.\nWe've implemented innovative technology processes that harness the power of machine learning\ncapabilities, which are evolving our operations, particularly in streamlining time consuming back-office\ntasks, such as reauthorization submissions.\nBy automating these processes, we've not only enhanced efficiency, but also freed up valuable\nresources, allowing our team to redirect their efforts towards delivering high quality care to our patients.\nWe work closely with two of our vent manufacturers to connect their devices to Engage Care Manager\n2.0, our proprietary clinical and operational platform. Effective care delivery in the modern health care\nlandscape necessitates the seamless integration of exceptional service with cutting edge technology.\nOur technology centric approach enables us to seize data driven opportunities, capitalize on emerging\ntrends and strengthen our ability to deliver value driven solutions for our payers and hospital partners.\nAs legacy manufacturers, such as Philips, are gradually exiting certain product categories, the industry is\npaving the way for the emergence of new generation of manufacturers equipped with the expertise to\ndevelop and deliver more improved technologies in enhanced connected capabilities. Furthermore, we're\npoised to capitalize on incentive programs related to Phillips trade-ins and remediation on the Trilogy 100\nventilators, enabling us to significantly lower the age of our ventilator asset base in an extremely cost\ncompetitive manner.\nResMed has also completed a few studies on the effects of GLP-1 drugs for sleep apnea patients. The\nlatest data is showing that there is a 10.5% higher propensity to start PAP over those not using the GLP-1\ndrug.\nMore patients are going to see the physician about their weight problems, and the data shows that while\nthe drug does help reduce AHI 59% to 63%, the patients are still left with moderate sleep apnea, which\nmeans they will suffocate every three minutes of sleep after treatment of the drugs are administered.\nWe also saw an announcement that the Samsung Galaxy Watch is now De Novo authorized by the FDA\nto detect signs of sleep apnea, which should pave the way for the Google Fitbit and Apple Watch to follow\nsuit.\nThe emergence of these technological advancements stands to streamline the diagnosis of sleep therapy\ninto the mainstream population. We expect this development would be significant to grow in our sleep and\nresupply business.\nOn the regulatory front, Viemed continues to navigate the evolving landscape of health care policy and\nreimbursement. Despite industry efforts, the government is yet to resolve a regulatory relief package for\nthe expiration of the 75-25 blended rate, a last remnant of the COVID related relief measures stemming\nfrom the pandemic.\nInComm Conferencing Page 3 of 13 www.incommconferencing.com\nAs a reminder, our comprehensive analysis suggests that the long-term impact on our business is\nexpected to be minimal, thanks to a combination of factors, including our diversified product mix and\nstrategic rural concentration.\nLooking ahead, we remain optimistic about the reimbursement environment and by the stability of rates\nindexed to inflation. The indexing mechanism serves as a natural hedge for our operations, providing a\ndegree of predictability and financial security.\nMoreover, our proactive approach to monitoring regulatory developments and engaging with\npolicymakers positions us to adapt, swiftly, to changes and capitalize on emerging opportunities.\nWith more financial and operational updates on the quarter, I will now hand the call over to our Chief\nOperating Officer, Todd Zehnder. Todd.\nTodd Zehnder\nThanks, Casey. In reviewing the financial results, all figures are in U.S. dollars and the full results have\nbeen made available on the SEC's website.\nOur core business generated net revenue of $50.6 million during the first quarter of 2024 as compared to\nnet revenues of $39.6 million in the first quarter of ‘23, which equates to a 28% increase. Our revenue\nwas relatively flat, sequentially, which is not uncommon when comparing 4Q to 1Q. And as we'll discuss\nlater, we expect rapid sequential growth throughout the year.\nOperationally, the first quarter was extremely strong. But as we've indicated in the past, it also brings\nseasonal challenges, due to re-offs and patients switching or resetting insurance plans.\nWhen comparing 1Q ‘24 to 4Q ‘23, our AR reserves were approximately $2.5 million higher in the current\nquarter, which shows how operationally strong the quarter was and why we're excited about the rest of\nthis year.\nAs in the past, we continue to stay optimistic that we will be able to continue our high organic growth\nrates, as well as additional inorganic opportunities, on top of the recent joint venture.\nOur first quarter revenue from vents was approximately 58%, as compared to 65% in the first quarter of\n2023. Our gross and EBITDA margins are still strong as we are focused on both margin and\ndiversification.\nWe continue to be successful in managing our cost structure this year, and it is showing in both gross and\nEBITDA contribution. Consistent with prior years, our first quarter margins are lower than other periods,\ndue to higher bad debt reserves, as well as cyclical costs that tend to be higher, earlier in the year. Our\ngross and EBITDA margins during the quarter came in at 59% and 20%, respectively.\nOur first quarter gross and EBITDA amounts came in at $29.8 million and $10.1 million, respectively. We\nare, once again, very excited to the beginning of the year from an operational perspective and know that\nthe fast start will translate into solid financial performance throughout the year.\nInComm Conferencing Page 4 of 13 www.incommconferencing.com\nOur SG&A for the quarter totaled approximately $24.8 million, as compared to $19.8 million in the first\nquarter of 2023. G&A as a percentage of revenue decreased from 50% during the first quarter of ‘23 to\n49% during 2024 and continues our theme of managing our G&A, well.\nAs mentioned, certain items such as payroll taxes and PTO accruals reset in the first quarter, each year.\nTherefore, the sequential comparison from 4Q to 1Q is always a challenge. We expect our annual\nmargins to approximate prior years as these items normalize, throughout the year.\nWe will continue to invest in our patient and employee experiences and, once again, expect to grow\nrevenues at a faster rate than expenses.\nFor the quarter, we invested approximately $5.8 million of capital expenditures, spread out amongst our\nvarious respiratory products. We continue to allocate capital across a diverse supplier network and, once\nagain, have had no problems with procuring the equipment necessary to service our growing patient\nbase.\nWe have, once again, funded our CapEx out of discretionary cash flow and continue to manage the\nbusiness in order to drop free cash flow onto the balance sheet. Our percentage of CapEx to EBITDA\nwas healthy at 57%. We will continue to disclose our annual discretionary free cash flow, but the quarter\nfluctuations in that metric make it less relevant. This quarter, in particular, saw a lower cash build and\nsignificant increase in our accounts receivable.\nAs most everyone is aware, the cyber-attack on Change Healthcare during February has put some\noperational and financial stresses on the healthcare system. As we briefly discussed during our last call,\nour team began to redirect certain claims during March to alternate payment clearing houses.\nWhile we were able to move swiftly on some of our larger carriers, the process to redirect all of our payers\nremains ongoing. We are confident that we have moved the majority of the dollars and have seen\npayments pick up, over the last few weeks. We are optimistic that the vast majority of the delayed cash\ndeposits should be caught up by the end of the second quarter.\nOur goal, currently, is to make sure the Change situation turns out only to be a delay in cash collections.\nAnd in order to do that, our team is working diligently, to make sure all claims are filed and accepted,\nthrough alternate options. I'm very proud of the revenue cycle team, along with our workflow partner,\nBonafide, and the diligence that we have shown in this process.\nOur capital allocation opportunities remain consistent with last year, and we will reiterate that our organic\ngrowth is the highest priority. Our inorganic growth, debt pay down and then equity buybacks continue to\nfall into the two through four slots, as to priority.\nWe are happy to have recently announced our first joint venture and also remain very proud of our\npristine balance sheet. We ended the quarter in a net cash positive position once again, and have total\nlong-term debt of $5.9 million. Our working capital at the end of the quarter was $8.4 million.\nAll-in-all we remain excited and proud about all of our metrics and continue to look forward to upcoming\nquarterly results.\nInComm Conferencing Page 5 of 13 www.incommconferencing.com\nMoving on to the second quarter, we have provided net revenue guidance in the $53.8 million to $54.8\nmillion range related to our core business, which includes approximately $1 million related to the recent\njoint venture. The midpoint of our net revenue guidance is up 25% over the core revenue in the second\nquarter of 2023 and is showing extremely impressive sequential growth.\nAs stated last quarter, the first quarter brings some seasonality challenges, but our operational success\nduring the quarter has set up a path to rapid growth throughout the year. We remain active in our\ndiscussions with investors and analysts and, once again, have seen our U.S. institutional ownership\nincrease, over the last couple of quarters.\nWe remain excited about telling our story of growth and see the current market as an opportunity to\nattract new investors.\nAt this time, I'm going to turn the call back over to Casey to wrap things up.\nCasey Hoyt\nThank you, Todd. As we reflect on the remarkable achievements of the first quarter of 2024, we're filled\nwith a profound sense of optimism and enthusiasm for our journey, ahead. Throughout the call, we've\ndiscussed our robust financial performance, strategic initiatives and the resilience of our team in the face\nof challenges.\nOur view of the emergence of GLP-1 drugs is aligned with the data available and should be a major\nopportunity for us. The technological advancements of mainstream wearables hold the potential to\nrevolutionize the diagnosis and management of home sleep studies and drive tremendous patient volume\nour way.\nDespite encountering some cash flow disruptions related to the Change Health Care situation, our\nunwavering commitment to operational excellence has propelled us forward, ensuring that Viemed\nremains well positioned for sustained growth and success.\nFirst quarter of 2024 marked a significant milestone for Viemed with our net revenue growing by an\nimpressive 28%, compared to the same period last year. Looking ahead to the second quarter and\nbeyond, we remain extremely optimistic about our prospects for continued growth and success in all of\nour core products.\nOur guidance for net revenue reflects our confidence in the strength of our core business and the\neffectiveness of our growth strategies.\nAs we embark on this exciting journey, we are deeply grateful for the ongoing support and confidence of\nour investors, analysts, employees and partners. Together, we will continue to push the boundaries of\ninnovation, drive positive change and deliver superior value to all stakeholders.\nThank you, once again, for your continued trust and support. We look forward to sharing our progress\nwith you in the quarters to come. This concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you. We'll now open up for\nfurther questions.\nOperator\nInComm Conferencing Page 6 of 13 www.incommconferencing.com\nThank you. We’ll now conduct our question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question,\nplease press “*”, “1” on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate that your line is in the\nquestion queue. You may press the “*” key, followed by the number “2” if you would like to remove your\nquestion from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your\nhandset, before pressing the star keys.\nOne moment please while we poll for questions.\nOur first question comes from Brooks O'Neil with Lake Street Capital Markets. Please state your question.\nBrooks O'Neil\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. I just want to welcome Glenn. I'm glad to see new face there. I think\nhe'll help a lot to attract new investors out there. So, I just want to start off by asking a little bit. I know it's\nnot your job, guys, to match my model, my modeling, who the heck knows. But expenses were a little bit\nhigher than we were modeling for Q1. And if I was listening correctly, you would attribute the majority of\nthat to the seasonal effects in Q1. But is there--are there any expense items you'd call out as maybe more\nof a trend or something than just a 1Q seasonal factor?\nTodd Zehnder\nNo, no, not at all, Brooks. If you look back to the first quarter of last year, we kind of had the same trend.\nThings just reset at the beginning of the year. And if you look at our margins in conjunction with first\nquarter to first quarter, it's not really out of bounds. We completely are confident that expenses as a\npercentage of revenue will be in line or likely very much better than last year.\nAnd then like I said in my prepared remarks, we think margins will, once again, kind of stay flat depending\non diversification, a lot of different things. But we're confident that there's nothing that is setting up a bad\ntrend, if you will.\nBrooks O'Neil\nYeah, that's great, Todd. Thanks for that. Let me just ask you this. I don't think I recall hearing or thinking\na lot about sales force restructuring. Are there any notable things you'd call out that you did that you think\ntruly will drive--I mean, obviously, 30% improvement in productivity is pretty good. So that's fantastic. But\nwhat is it exactly that you guys did that you think has unlocked some of the productivity of the sales\norganization?\nCasey Hoyt\nWell, I think the most important driver, right now, is the fact that we've extended our reach with promoting\n12 more territory managers. Those 12 managers are now out in the field working with veteran reps and\nnew reps, helping them with training and development and so on and so forth. If you think about last year,\nlast year we had three sales trainers and three managers doing that same work.\nSo, we've doubled the ability to get our experienced people out into the field. That's producing at a higher\nrate. We're actually doing some cleanup work. So, the good news is we're doing all of this growth with a\nlittle bit with less reps than we did last year. However, we are set up to grow at a higher rate now and\nexpand with new reps.\nWe just saw a major opportunity in the restructuring and really the main thesis was let's get our middle tier\nreps up to top tier reps, come because we're really just getting started with it.\nInComm Conferencing Page 7 of 13 www.incommconferencing.com\nBrooks O'Neil\nGreat. So, my last question is, you guys hit on two of the big buzz topics going on in health care, today,\nthe GLP-1s and the Change Healthcare thing. So, I guess I'd be remiss if I didn't ask you about is there\ngoing to be any impact in your business from AI?\nCasey Hoyt\nThere already is some machine learning. We're hesitant to call it AI; call it machine learning. We've\ndeveloped our own tool here in house that is going through some of the HIE exchanges, health\ninformation exchanges that are with Epic and Cerner and have all the hospital info into them to find some\nof the missing data with that we require for our reauthorizations. And that's exciting because it's getting\nsmarter every day and starting to help us, operationally.\nNow on the back end of that, in terms of just exploring AI solutions, we’ve had all of our head lieutenants,\nall of our VPs to go out and uncover solutions that will help us. And I will say that we're vetting a number\nof them, right now, that stand to improve operation efficiency. So, we're--I'm excited about this movement.\nIt's--we've got our own tool in house, and we've got others that we're going to lean on, through various\nvendors.\nBrooks O'Neil\nGreat. Guys, thanks a lot for taking my questions. Congratulations on the great start to the year, and I'm\nlooking forward to the balance to see all you can accomplish.\nTodd Zehnder\nThanks, Brooks.\nCasey Hoyt\nThanks, Brooks.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from Doug Cooper with Beacon Securities. Please state your\nquestion.\nDoug Cooper\nHey, good morning everybody. Let's just talk about the sequential growth, 7% sequentially, very strong. Is\nthere one particular product that's driving that growth, i.e., whether it be sleep or is it on the NIBs or sort\nof equally split?\nTodd Zehnder\nThis quarter, I would say the strongest performers were vents and sleep, just from a 40,000 foot view.\nResupply had a really good start to the year and vents, like Casey said, 30% higher productivity this\nquarter than we have. So, everything performed well across all the product lines, but those are the ones\nthat stand out to us that led the charge.\nDoug Cooper\nOkay. You see obviously early in the game here, we're not even halfway through Q2, but do you see that\n7%, 6%, 7% sequential growth continuing for the balance of the year? That would put you pretty much far\nin advance of where we're modeling right now.\nInComm Conferencing Page 8 of 13 www.incommconferencing.com\nTodd Zehnder\nI think w-- I mean, just looking, I know we did the numbers for the call. I believe Q2 over Q1 was 5.5%\nsequential growth. So, we're very bullish on the way things are set up, right now.\nDoug Cooper\nOkay. The expiration of the 75/25, what was the actual impact of that? And then that was offset by what,\nCPI increases and, obviously, just some growth in the business. Can you segment those items?\nTodd Zehnder\nSo, I'll keep growth in the business outside of the calculation and just tell you that roughly, $1 million--a\nlittle bit shy of $1 million was going to be the 75/25 impact across the Viemed HMP complex, combined.\nAnd then the CPI adjustment was slightly higher than that. So, I bet you we got probably somewhere\nbetween less than a quarter of million dollars benefit, when it comes to rate changes and then everything\nelse would just be normal operations.\nSo, I pointed it out, while we stayed flat revenue wise, on a net revenue basis, I look at it on a gross\nnumber and say that we booked about $2.5 million more to the allowance, this quarter. That would be the\ngrowth piece that you're--the last piece that you're asking about.\nDoug Cooper\nOkay. You guys talked about, obviously, the GLP-1 drug and you referenced the ResMed study. I guess,\nsubsequent to ResMed study that they talked about, Eli Lilly came out with their drug obviously, and\nsome trials that were directly for sleep apnea, as opposed to weight loss. Any thoughts on that?\nCasey Hoyt\nI mean, I didn't--you're talking about the clinical trial that compared the safety of a vent drug to GLP-1\nreceptors and that. I didn't really get a chance to dig into that study yet, Doug. So, I don't want to\ncomment.\nDoug Cooper\nI don't think it's released yet. I think it’s just the highlights are. I think the study is out in July, I believe,\nright?\nCasey Hoyt\nYeah, it's underway. I mean, I think look, here is the most important piece that we got just from the\nResMed comments and their analysis of their 600,000 patients that were on path. And it does show that it\nreduces AHI, which it may bring a CPAP patient from severe down to moderate. But what they're seeing\nis a spike in volume of the patients that are going in to analyze their weight gain or weight loss scenario.\nDoctors are still saying, no, we can put you on this drug and we'll get you down 40 pounds to 50 pounds,\nbut you're still going to have moderate sleep apnea, and sleep apnea will be a part of your program in\nconjunction with the GLP-1 drug.\nSo, ResMed and our view as well, because of our numbers and because of the growth that we've been\nexperiencing in sleep--throughout the country for the last a year and half, two years, since these drugs\nhave been out, it's kind of proven that these things are going to help with our growth versus be against us.\nInComm Conferencing Page 9 of 13 www.incommconferencing.com\nAnd so, we're excited about that. And I think that all the technology on the back end that I was talking\nabout in the call with making home sleep testing more mainstream through wearables is going to just\ngoing to just drive more and more patients into addressing their sleep concerns ,which would play into our\nhand down the road, as well.\nDoug Cooper\nSo, two follow ups on that, Casey. Just what do you think the regulatory reimbursement will be there? Will\nthere be any change in that, given what's happening in the industry? Part A and B, your M&A strategy\ngoing forward, is it focused on respiratory still or sleep and/or other areas? And have you seen multiples\ncome down that people want to pay? Obviously, the public companies have taken it to pretty big multiple\nhit, over the past few months.\nCasey Hoyt\nYeah, I mean, we haven't seen much of a shift in multiples. However, our respiratory focus is still at the\ntop of mind whenever we're strategizing M&A targets. There are other bolt on products that we are\nintrigued about that some of these targets have that are different than what we have. I'll comment on\nHMP and how their additional business that make them full line DME was a key driver in our\nconversations with landing our first joint venture.\nAnd so, it helped us to just realize that this is the holistic offering that maybe the JV and the hospital\nsystems need. And so, we're building that model out and its entire value props as we speak with other JV\ntargets, around the country. So, I guess our M&A strategy has changed from the standpoint that we're not\njust after the respiratory DME, we're also after the hospital owned DME that is more full line. And so, we'll-\n-and we've already got those guys in the pipeline and the conversations are teed up.\nDoug Cooper\nOkay. And just one last one for me if I could, Todd. The resupply revenue, I think, last quarter was $5\nmillion on 33,000 patients. Could you have just an update on what it was this quarter, revenue in\npatients?\nTodd Zehnder\nIt looks like I've got that at $4 million, right now. So, $5 million might be a little heavy because I think we're\nup, quarter-over-quarter, but I'll have to get back to you on that.\nDoug Cooper\nOkay. Thanks, guys.\nTodd Zehnder\nSure.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from Alexander Graf with Riva Ridge Capital. Please state your\nquestion.\nAlexander Graf\nThanks for taking my question. Just had a quick one on the automating of reauthorization. Could you\nmaybe give us a better sense of a little bit more granularity in terms of what resources will be freed up\nand how Viemed intends to use those resources?\nInComm Conferencing Page 10 of 13 www.incommconferencing.com\nTodd Zehnder\nYeah, I mean, what we're piloting at this point is using our Engage software, which is proprietary, to pull\ndownloads for compliance and then using another tool that we've developed internally that will go and\nscour the HIEs that Casey was talking about, earlier. And in the event that we can match up a good\ndownload with good notes, it will free up a variety of people. We have a back office--our corporate office\nteam that works on the gathering of data.\nIn certain circumstances, it might free up a service respiratory therapist who doesn't have to go to the\nhouse to pull a download from the machine. It could, potentially, free up a salesperson who doesn't have\nto go and call on a physician's office to get notes if we're having trouble from the corporate office. So, it's\na variety of people. It hasn't hit full scale yet to where we're really getting a full benefit, but it's something\nwe've been working on.\nAnd then at that point, what you could do is you're keeping salespeople are selling, you're keeping\ntherapists out there servicing new patients and more patients. And then your back office can just turn\nmore orders around. So it's a variety.\nAlexander Graf\nUnderstood. That's helpful. So, I guess, overall, the takeaway should be that that largely should help kind\nof build revenue and become more efficient from a cost perspective. So, in terms of cost as a percentage\nof sales, this initiative you guys think should lead to an improvement of that or continued improvement?\nTodd Zehnder\nYeah, and I also think that if we're able to do it on a more timely basis, we can turn around\nreauthorizations on a faster basis, which keeps people off of hold for lesser time, which should help with\noverall realizations. So that's something, whether we're using our technological tools or just trying to staff\nup to make sure that those patients aren't on hold as long, we're always trying to make improvements in.\nAlexander Graf\nUnderstood, got it. That’s helpful. Thank you so much.\nTodd Zehnder\nSure thing, Alex.\nOperator\nThank you. And just a reminder, to ask a question, press “*”, “1” on your phone. Our next question comes\nfrom Jeff Bronchick with Cove Street Capital. Please state your question.\nJeff Bronchick\nHey, guys. How are you? Hey, just could you go over--you made a sort of a comment about the\nreceivables from the UNH situation. And are you worried or is there a sense that this is so messy that\nthere's a write off, not a material business thing. How does this progress, financially?\nTodd Zehnder\nYeah, so, at this point, that is like our entire focus is to make sure there isn't a write off. At this point, like I\nsaid, it's a cash flow impact. I want to say we're probably $4 million heavy at Q1 on AR versus cash\nInComm Conferencing Page 11 of 13 www.incommconferencing.com\ncollections. And then as I mentioned, we've worked that number down. But it takes a carrier-by-carrier\nchange from Change Healthcare to an alternate clearinghouse.\nSo, you have to have your data in order. You have to make sure that once the changes are made that\nthey're accepted, there's not rejections. So, there's more work to go in, but that's entirely what our team is\nfocused on to make sure that we don't have the smaller carriers not get through to where we would have\ntimely filing, six months down the road. So, at this point, we don't expect to have any additional write offs.\nI'm confident in saying that. But it is work that's being done and I think the entire industry is facing that,\nright now.\nJeff Bronchick\nAnd just again, just will you again, recap the regulatory environment? And my guess is nothing happens\nthis year because it's an election year. But maybe just talk about some of the things that, aside from the\n75/25, that have come up or not, are positive or not, just an overall viewpoint?\nCasey Hoyt\nI mean, the--I guess some of the positive things that we've seen from a regulatory basis have started on a\nstate-by-state basis. There's a thing called Step Therapy where some of the payers' medical policies are\nasking you to try and fail a lesser device before approving a ventilator, and it adds another layer of\nauthorization and burden on, frankly, the patient more or less than us.\nI mean, for sure our business but more about the patient trying a lesser device and suffocating and then\nhaving a document failure, before they go into a ventilator. That is wrong and, clinically, there's no data\nthat proves that that is a method that we should be embracing.\nSo, we've been able to change legislation around Oklahoma, Louisiana. We're working on Louisiana and\nMississippi, and there's really been no opposition to those efforts because it's kind of common sense.\nWe're seeing some of that activity up on the Hill in D.C., as well.\nAA Home Care is now one of our industry associations that's behind this movement that's also spreading\nthis message throughout the country. And I just think that's an overall positive win for us. I mean, we're\ndealing with that--we've been dealing with that burden for the last two to three years, and to get some\nrelief on that would be huge.\nBut other than that, there's really, I mean, there's some things that don't really affect Viemed, but I mean\nlike with diabetes regulations and stuff like that, but really we're pretty stable from the standpoint of the\nthings that we're focused on or that would affect our business. There's nothing outside of 75/25 that are\npressures on reimbursement.\nAnd as we've communicated, it's really not that much of a pressure for our business. So again, we\ncouldn't be more pleased, I guess, with the current state of affairs with on the regulatory front. And\nfrankly, it's the most stable it's ever been, since I've been running the business.\nTodd Zehnder\nYeah, and I'll add one thing. I mean, the question we always get is competitive bidding and is it coming\nback. And while we don't have an answer to say yes or no, it might. We're at the point, we're getting close\nto the point where we can say that we're confident it won't be here for 2025. And generally, it gets\nannounced, if you will, about 18 months ahead of time.\nInComm Conferencing Page 12 of 13 www.incommconferencing.com\nSo, if we don't hear anything from CMS over the next few months, we're going to be at a point where we\ndon't think it’ll be around for 2026, either. While we don't--we're not afraid of competitive bidding, we bid in\nthe last round, which got canceled. We just don't see it coming back in the near term just because it has\nnot been sort of rolled out properly, if it's coming back anytime soon.\nJeff Bronchick\nAlright, thanks, guys.\nTodd Zehnder\nAlright, Jeff, thanks.\nCasey Hoyt\nThank you.\nOperator\nThere are no further questions at this time. I'll hand the floor over to Todd Zehnder for closing comments.\nTodd Zehnder\nAll right. We want to thank everybody for their participation, and please follow-up if you have any\nadditional questions. Thank you.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference call. All parties may disconnect. Have a good day.\nInComm Conferencing Page 13 of 13 www.incommconferencing.com"

Today, we’ll explore the financial achievements, market trends, and strategic\ninsights that have contributed to our continued success. We will provide details on how VieMed\nis not only thriving, but also actively shaping the landscape of at-home respiratory care. We are\nexecuting, at a very high level, on our strategic initiatives, driving growth to financial results and\nremarkable growth.\nInComm Conferencing Page 1 of 13 www.incommconferencing.com\nOur seamless integration of the HMP acquisition has accelerated our expansion of the core\ncomplex respiratory business, and is rapidly diversifying our respiratory offerings. This significant\nstride is a testament to our steadfast focus on reaching more patients, enhancing their lives, and\nimproving outcomes. Before we delve further into our results, I want to take a moment to thank\nour team for their hard work and dedication.\nOur success is built on the shoulders of an incredible team of dedicated healthcare professionals.\nFrom our respiratory therapists and behavioral health specialists to our staffing professionals and\nadministrative support staff, they are the driving force behind VieMed’s exceptional results and\ncontinued, record setting growth. As of the end of the second quarter, our VieMed family has\nexpanded to include 988 employees, each playing an important role in our collective success.\nLet me begin by commenting on our core, organic business model. As a reminder, 58% of our\nbusiness is generated by our complex, respiratory service model, which is driven by ventilation.\nOur vent patients are typically on our care for a 17 month length of stay at the end of their life. In\nterms of payer demographics, 45% of our patients are covered by traditional Medicare and 12%\nare enrolled in some for of Medicare Advantage or managed Medicaid program.\nIt’s worth emphasizing that, historically, the Medicare patient population served by an industry as\na whole, constitutes just 6% of COPD patients eligible for non-invasive ventilation treatment. We\nestimate that the private insurance population reflects similar numbers. This ongoing,\nunderserved patient segment is a key driver of our persistent growth. Our governor to growth is\nnot about finding available patients to treat, but more about finding clinicians and salespeople\navailable to communicate our offering to the physicians and hospital case managers.\nOur staffing division, VHS, has played a pivotal roll in developing recruitment protocols that rapidly\nidentify an onboard talented individuals. As a result, we are continuing to expand our training and\nmanagement structure to support the growth of our personnel. This relatively new ability to source\nsales people efficiently will certainly be the driving force behind our future, geographic expansion.\nAdditionally, we’ve observed substantial growth in our oxygen services, which constitute\napproximately 10% of our product mix and treats earlier stages of COPD. Given the terminal\nnature of COPD, it’s common for patients to progress to a point where they require our complex\nrespiratory ventilation services in later stages of their journey. Notably, by the end of the quarter,\napproximately 18% of our oxygen patients also had ventilator usage.\nIt’s estimated that there are 12.5 million eligible oxygen patients in the country, with only a 12%\nmarket penetration nationwide, representing yet another significantly underserved population in\nneed of our help and opportunity for continued growth. With HMP, our most recent acquisition,\nbeing a heavy sleep business, we’ve driven our sleep business up to 17% of our product mix. The\nhighest margin segment within sleep is in the recurring mask, tubing, filter sector, or as well call\nit, the re-supply business.\nWith the addition of HMP, our re-supply business is now making up 47% of our overall sleep\nbusiness. With an estimated 150 million people suffering from sleep apnea, only 30 million\ndiagnosed, and roughly 5 to 8% of the folks on service, we are, once again, taking care of an\nunder-served population. Many healthcare companies are confronting speculation around the\nadoption of GLP-1 diabetes and weight loss drugs. VieMed’s core, complex respiratory business\nInComm Conferencing Page 2 of 13 www.incommconferencing.com\ndifferentiates us from the other home medical equipment companies, making us less susceptible\nto competition from GLP-1 weight loss drugs.\nWe have seen no measurable, negative impact from these drugs being on the market. And\nperhaps, the best way to prove this is to reflect on our third quarter numbers. Our organic, VieMed\nbusiness experienced 11%, sequential sleep growth from Q2, and have grown our sleep business\nevery quarter for the past year and a half during the time GLP-1 drugs have been on the market.\nFurthermore, our manufacturers of sleep equipment are also reporting zero findings of any decline\nrelated to GLP-1 drugs.\nWe fully expect to realize growth in our sleep business for 2024, and beyond. The successful\nintegration of HMP into the VieMed healthcare family has marked a significant milestone in our\nstrategy growth trajectory. We are delighted to report that our first full quarter with HMP was\nimmediately accretive to our net income and earnings per share, demonstrating the soundness\nof our investment.\nWhat’s equally crucial, is that this acquisition hasn’t hindered our organic growth. Instead, it has\nacted as a catalyst, igniting new possibilities. Our commitment to enhancing our cost structure,\nwhile simultaneously setting the groundwork for revenue synergies, has been at the heart of this\nintegration. We work tirelessly to ensure a seamless transition, converting software and systems\nto align with our established processes and technology.\nFurthermore, HMP employees have undergone comprehensive training, not only to adapt to the\nnew systems, but to fully embrace our technology, unique service offerings, and the VieMed value\nproposition. One of the keys to our successful integration has been the remarkable, cultural fit\nbetween VieMed and HMP. This alignment of values, mission, and work ethic has fostered a\ncooperative and harmonious environment, where we can leverage the strength of both\norganizations effectively.\nLooking ahead, we consider this acquisition as a strategic springboard for our organic growth\nmodel, in several respects. Geographically, we are expanding into new areas, capitalizing on\nstrength and synergies brought by HMP to penetrate markets that were previously untapped. We\nare also growing complimentary products and services that align with our core offerings, creating\nvalue for our patients ad stakeholders.\nIn addition, our broader network of payers is offering us exciting, new avenues for growth,\nenabling us to maximize the reach and impact of our specialized, home respiratory care. While\nour M&A pipeline is active, it’s important to note that it remains supplemental to our primary growth\ndriver, the organic engine. In a landscape where interest rates are rising and deal volumes are\ndeclining, we are fortunate to not be relying on acquisitions to fuel our growth.\nWe have consistently demonstrated that we are in a position to grow independently, leveraging\nour existing capabilities, infrastructure, and expertise. Our steadfast focus on organic growth\nallows us to maintain a strong and sustainable trajectory, making strategic acquisitions a nice\ncompliment, rather than a necessity to our business model. In the third quarter, we continued to\nallocate resources towards technology.\nOur proprietary engaged platform and data analytics play a pivotal role in our achievements. While\nharnessing data to predict patient needs and tailor treatment plans, we have not only improved\nInComm Conferencing Page 3 of 13 www.incommconferencing.com\npatient outcomes, but have differentiated ourselves from our peers in the eyes of our referral\nsources and payers. We recently introduced version 2.0, which we call engaged care manager.\nThe enhancements within this tool facilitate greater, cross-functional integration with multiple\nequipment manufacturers, enabling a device-agnostic approach to patient care.\nThe broader use of equipment on engage care manager allows our manufacturing partners to\nhave their devices be a part of the driving improved compliance, and patient adoption within their\ndevices. Ultimately, these advancements further solidify our position as a relevant player in an\nevolving, value-based care landscape, demonstrating our commitment to innovation and\nexcellence in patient care.\nOn the regulatory front, we are experiencing a notable degree of stability, with little, recent\nmovement. There have been no indications of the return of competitive bidding and we anticipate\nfurther improvements in reimbursement, due to consumer price index, CPI, to be implemented\nsoon. There is a national push from our industry association, AAHomecare, to support continued,\ncommon sense measures undertaken during pandemic, particularly the 75/25 blended rates for\nCPAP and oxygen.\nWhile these relief measures are crucial to ensure patients have necessary access to care, it’s\nimportant to note that their financial impact on VieMed is relatively modest, as a result of our\nunique product mix and concentration in rural markets. In the event that the blended rate relief\nexpires at year’s end, we estimate that our rates tied to the CMS fee schedule would still, on\naverage, increase between 0.5 and 2%, when we combine the CPI adjustment.\nThis rule change, while not significantly impacting VieMed directly, may hold more significance\nfor other competitors across the country. In addition, we are eagerly anticipating the\nimplementation of the final rule for Medicare Advantage plans set for 2024. This rule introduces\nadditional health plan utilization management oversight to processes, including mandatory,\nannual reviews of MA plan’s clinical policies and coverage denial reviews.\nIt’s conducted by healthcare professions with relevant expertise. This rule will ultimately improve\naccess to care for life saving devices, such as ventilators, for patients struggling with a terminal\ndisease. Our view is that the accountability for Medicare will be a positive tailwind for VieMed in\n2024, and beyond.\nAt this juncture, I will now hand the call over to Chief Operating Officer, Todd Zehnder, to provide\nadditional insights regarding our financial results and capital activities.\nTodd Zehnder\nAll right. Thank you, Casey. In reviewing the financial results, all figures are in U.S. dollars. And\nthe full results have been made available on the SEC website, as well as SEDAR. Our core\nbusiness generated net revenue of $49.4 million during the third quarter of 2023, as compared to\nnet revenues of $35.8 million in the third quarter of 2022, which equates to a 38% increase. Our\nsequential growth for the core business was 14%, as we had HMP for the entire third quarter and\nour organic growth was, once again, strong.\nWithout factoring in the acquisition, our growth rate over last year’s third quarter, was\napproximately 19%, and approximately 4%, sequentially. We continue to stay optimistic that we\nInComm Conferencing Page 4 of 13 www.incommconferencing.com\nwill be able to continue our high, organic growth rates, as well as continue our evaluation of\ninorganic opportunities. Our third quarter revenue from vents was approximately 58% of core\nrevenue, as compared to 67% in the third quarter of 2022. Our gross and EBITDA margin\npercentages are still strong, and improving, as we are focused on both margin and diversification.\nWe’ve been very successful in managing our cost structure this year, and it is showing in both\ngross and EBITDA contribution. We continue to see our margin percentage be influenced by our\nproduct mix, but once again, point out the rapid, notional growth. Our gross and EBITDA margins\nduring the quarter came in at 61.9% and 24.5%, respectively. Our third quarter gross and EBITDA\namounts came in at $30.6 and $12.1 million, respectively.\nA couple of highlights are that this is the highest gross margin percentage that we have posted in\ntwo years, and our third quarter 2023 EBITDA is approximately 73% higher than third quarter\n2022 EBITDA, which is a result of the continued, organic growth, aggressive cost management,\nand the closing of the HMP acquisition during June. Our SG&A for the quarter totaled\napproximately $23.7 million, as compared to $17.7 million in the third quarter of 2022. We have\nmanaged our G&A during the current year effectively, which is evidenced by our EBITDA margins\nexpanding by a wider margin than our gross margin percentages.\nWe are benefiting from some scaling of our operations around the country, as well as our home\noffice. We’ll continue to invest in our patient employee experiences, and once again, expect to\ngrow revenues at a faster pace than expenses. For the quarter, we invested approximately $7.4\nmillion on CapEx, and once again, the highest amounts have been spent on vents and oxygen\nequipment. The CapEx has been spent through a diversified supplier network, and we are seeing\nadditional supplier networks that have come, or will be coming to market.\nWe funded all of our CapEx with discretionary cash flow during the quarter, and our core business\nhad a record of free cash flow after CapEx. We are very proud of the pristine balance sheet we\nmaintained, where we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $10 million. Additionally, we\nended the quarter with overall working capital of $4 million. We have paid down $4 million on our\nrevolver facility during the quarter and have lowered our long-term debt at September 30th, to\napproximately $8 million.\nWe will opportunistically pay down or use the revolver portion, depending on needs of cash,\nresulting from additional, organic growth, or future, inorganic opportunities. When we step back\nand look at the ongoing, financial performance of the business, our growth and diversification are\nreally showing in the free cash flow that we are generating. We have grown the amount of revenue\nthat is transactional, over time, and therefore, it does not come with the same CapEx burden as\nour rental equipment growth.\nWe are very confident in our ability to continue to grow our free cash flow, even in light of our\nCapEx needs, as we grow our active, rental patients. This free cash flow generation will give us\nflexibility, as we continue to monitor our capital allocation. As we review our capital allocation\nopportunities, we once again, will reiterate that our organic growth is the highest priority. This\nquarter, we took the opportunity to pay down debt, as we integrate the HMP transaction, and we\nwill likely continue to do that until another acquisition opportunity arises.\nLastly, we will actively monitor our share price and other factors to determine if another share\nbuy-back would make sense to be implemented. Moving onto the fourth quarter, we have provided\nInComm Conferencing Page 5 of 13 www.incommconferencing.com\nnet revenue guidance in the $49.8 to $51 million dollar range, related to our core business. The\nmid-point of our net revenue guidance is up 34% over the core revenue in the fourth quarter of\n2022.\nLastly, we remain active in our discussions with existing and potentially new investors. We\nparticipated in a couple of institutional investor conferences during the third quarter, and plan on\nattending another one during this quarter. We remain excited about telling our story of growth,\nand see the current market as an opportunity to attract new investors.\nAt this time, I’ll turn it back over to Casey to wrap things up.\nCasey Hoyt\nOkay. Thank you, Todd. Our unwavering commitment to pioneering advancements in the home\nrespiratory care industry is evident, with our impressive results we’ve achieved this quarter. We\ncouldn’t be more proud of our management team and staff for their continued execution on every\nlevel. Reflecting on our business after the first three quarters, we are extremely bullish that our\nshare price does not represent the value of our organization.\nWe have grown every line of our business organically, and are ahead of schedule on optimizing\nthe HMP acquisition. The regulatory landscape is not only stable, but favorable to our unique and\nspecific business model. While we have a pipeline of acquisition targets ready, we have proven\nthat we don’t have to rely on buying companies when the conditions aren’t right. Our view is that\nour company is reasonably recession proof, with the ever-increasing need to taking care of an\naging population yearning for more comfortable and quality care in the home.\nWe are proud to highlight our historical results to investors, demonstrating VieMed’s proven track\nrecord of execution. VieMed Healthcare’s dedication to delivering high quality, specialized\nservices, and our relentless pursuit of innovative solutions continue to drive our success and set\nus apart as leaders in the field. As we move forward, we remain steadfast in our mission to provide\nthe best care for our patients and to lead the industry through a commitment to excellence,\ninnovation, and unwavering dedication to improving patient outcomes.\nOur focus remains on treating the under-served population, and we are well positioned to shape\nthe home respiratory care industry for the better, ultimately benefiting our patients and\nstakeholders, alike.

Our first question comes from Brooks\nO’Neil with Lake Street Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nInComm Conferencing Page 6 of 13 www.incommconferencing.com\nBrooks O’Neil\nThank you, very much. Good morning, guys. Terrific quarter. You just keep executing and it’s\nfantastic. So, let me ask you one or two quick questions. The first one is, I know that sleep is\nrelatively small part of the business, but I’ve heard, anecdotally, that there has been some\nsoftness in the sleep market. Could you just comment on whether you’re seeing that and whether\nyou think you can do something to offset softness in the business, in the industry, or whether it’s\nsomething that’s going to be a headwind for a period of time?\nCasey Hoyt\nFirst off, we couldn’t disagree more that it would be a headwind for our business. I mean, we’re\nexperiencing 11% sequential growth in the sleep market. We have not seen any lack of adherence\nto PAP equipment, whether it be on the front-end, as finding our patients, or on the back-end,\nthrough re-supply of folks giving up on therapy. The -- I’m commenting on the market for a reason\nin my comments there, Brooks, just to let everyone know how large of a field we have of patients.\nI mean, we’ve got 150 million patients over there, in the country, and we only have a 5 to 8%\nmarket penetration on those guys. We’ve got a lot of work to do. But we have seen no effect from\nthese GLP-1 drugs. They’ve been around for -- what? -- a year and a half, two years now. And\nwe’ve been in growth mode, sequentially, in sleep through that whole entire period.\nThe -- even -- furthermore, you’re pay attention to some of our sleep manufacturers, you can draw\nthe similar trend and storylines, as well. They are commenting that they are not seeing any lack\nof adherence to sleep or any stunts to their growth. So, look, I get it. It’s something -- it’s a story\nline and everybody needs to beat it up and be skeptical, for sure, from an investor standpoint.\nBut look, it’s -- we’re very -- hear me loud and clear, we are not experiencing any decline in sleep.\nIt’s only growth. And we expect to see more of that in the future.\nBrooks O’Neill\nGreat. Let me ask you one other question. So, I have some sense that one of your equipment\nsuppliers, Phillips, has had some issues with the government. And, can you comment on A, if\nthat’s affected you any way, and if so, maybe how have you responded?\nTodd Zehnder\nYeah, I mean, obviously, Brooks, this has been going on for a few years now. The recall effected\nthe sleep apnea devices as well as the ventilators. The ventilators never were to be taken off of\nmarket, because the life-saving device component of it. As we understand, the majority, if not all,\nof the sleep replacement devices have been taken care of. If it’s not completed, it’s very close, so\nwe anticipate that they probably come back to market with sleep apnea devices, at some point.\nCall it relatively soon -- not sure when that happens.\nObviously, there’s others in the market that have filled that need. On the ventilator side -- they are\nin process of working with the government on some sort of remediation. Once again, that has not\nreally impacted our business too much. There’s operational, logistic-type things that we’ve dealt\nwith. We’ve been dealing with those for three years. But we have no looming issue, that we are\naware of. Our anticipation is that that remediation gets done at some point over the next few\nmonths. But until then it’s just business as usual.\nInComm Conferencing Page 7 of 13 www.incommconferencing.com\nBrooks O’Neil\nGreat. Let me ask one, last question. So I hear from some people who think that VieMed is, like,\nsome other DME companies in the marketplace. I think those other DME companies are\ncharacterized by A, growth by acquisition; B, I like to call them trucks and muscles. They pretty\nmuch have a bunch of trucks and the muscle guys drive the to the patient, drop off the equipment,\nand keep moving. Could you just give us a -- the Reader’s Digest version of why that is not VieMed\nand why you think your model creates tremendous opportunity in the marketplace?\nCasey Hoyt\nYeah, I mean, it goes back to our complex, respiratory business, which makes up 58% of what\nwe do. That’s the foundation of us scaling around the country. We never had the model of being\na wheelchair, walker, bed, commode type of business. That would still be your one-stop shop, all\nthings, everything DME. And so, that lends it self to, where do you go?\nWe don’t have to buy people in order to grow. We just need another person that we -- clinician\nthat we can train how to walk and talk the VieMed way. We get in front of the sales process,\nwalking shoulder to shoulder with that pulmonologist inside of the facility. And we become an\nextension of their care and we -- and a value resource to the hospital case managers who are\npairing up equipment providers with the patients.\nAnd so, at the end of the day, the -- it’s two, different separate business models. And you’re right,\nthe important thing to focus on is, it’s -- it goes back to our spin-out. The reason that we spun out\nback in 2017 is that we had two different models for growth and two different needs of capital from\nthe folks that purchased VieMed. They needed to go out and buy other companies in order to\ngrow. We did not need that.\nWe needed go out and find people and put personnel. And so, those -- that is still dominant here\ntoday and is a trend in our growth plan and model. And it really is the differentiator from us and\nthe competitor. Both models are successful. So I’m not throwing any our peers or competitors\nunder the bus. These guys have their own ways of growing. We have our own ways of growing.\nThey -- it -- they are very different, in our opinion, and we shouldn’t be lumped into the same\ncategory.\nBrooks O’Neil\nAbsolutely. Thanks for that, Casey and Todd, and thanks for all the good information. Have a nice\ntoday.\nTodd Zehnder\nAll right, Brooks. Thanks.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Cooper with Beacon Securities. Please\nproceed with your question.\nDoug Cooper\nCan you hear me?\nCasey Hoyt\nInComm Conferencing Page 8 of 13 www.incommconferencing.com\nYep. We can hear you now.\nDoug Cooper\nOkay. First of all, great quarter, and obviously, the market is not really taking the numbers into\nconsideration. So let me circle back on Brooks’ comment on, first of all, on the GLP-1 drugs. Aside\ngetting into the fact that the market thinks, seems to think that respiratory illness is going away\nand sleep apnea is going away, I think it’s worth remembering that, as you said, 17% of your\nbusiness is sleep, in other words, 83% is not impacted by these GLP-1 drugs. Can you just, first\nall, make a comment about COPD and the GLP drugs? I’m assuming there’s zero impact on that,\nbut I just want confirmation from you.\nCasey Hoyt\nYeah, that’s correct. I mean, the COPD patient is totally different than the sleep apnea patient.\nWe -- so, I guess, complex respiratory, as we define it, is inclusive of percussion vests, inclusive\nof oxygen and then, ventilation. And so, that business is really not affected or, I guess, targeted\nby GLP-1 drugs.\nThere’s actually some studies out there that say that the skinnier the patient is, the more\nsusceptible they are to death, in the COPD realm, at the end stages of their life. But, we’re trying\nto -- I’m glad you brought it up, Doug, because we do want to differentiate the fact that, yes, sleep,\nwhich is a bulls eye for GLP-1s, in a lot people’s eyes, is only 17% of our business and the rest\nis not affected by it.\nDoug Cooper\nSo let’s just focus in on that 17% for a second, just to -- and when ResMed reported their results,\nI guess, earlier in the week, they, on their conference call had talked about that they are actively\ntracking a cohort of many thousands of patients who are on GLP-1 medications, as well as\nResMed’s PAP therapy, and they are not seeing any significant change in PAP adherence or any\nreduced participation in resupply programs versus the control group.\nSo, in their opinion, it seems to that, even if the case, where some patients are on the GLP drugs,\nthose patients maybe were in the, sort of, morbidly obese category and were outside of the\nmainstream healthcare system anyway. And bringing those back into the fold, actually, could help\nstimulate their business, because sleep apnea devices are part and parcel with a road to wellness.\nAny thoughts on that?\nCasey Hoyt\nYeah, I mean, I guess the theme is that everyone’s trying to figure out what the effects are going\nto be on their business. I mean, it’s interesting that ResMed seems to be conducting their own\nstudies. And I like the sound of that -- the fact that you have folks with a BMI, body mass index,\nof 30, 32, 35 that are not going into the primary care system, but, hey, if you want a GLP-1 drug,\nyou’re going to have to go see your doctor.\nAnd so, sure, GLP-1 might be a part of it, but I guarantee, sleep apnea is going to be needed, as\nwell. So, their theory is that, if we get more patients going to see the doctor, that might help grow\nthe sleep apnea business, because we don’t see this as a cure to sleep apnea. It could be\nsomething that’s helpful in the treatment of the overall patient experience, but it’s not going to\ncure sleep apnea.\nInComm Conferencing Page 9 of 13 www.incommconferencing.com\nAnd so, that’s an interesting thought, but again, these are all just ideas, at this point, from folks\ntrying to communicate what might be ahead for the business. And I support what ResMed is\nsaying right there.\nTodd Zehnder\nAnd I’m just going to reiterate what we said in our prepared remarks, and maybe what Hoyt replied\nto Brooks on, is that, I think the GLP drugs have been around for probably a year and a half two\nyears, in kind of wide mass. And we have grown our sleep business -- not even including HMP -\n- we have grown our sleep business every quarter, from that point to now. And really, the growth\n-- I’m not sure it’s ever been as high as it was 3Q over 2Q, which was 11%.\nSo kind of at the height of the scare of sleep business going away, our sleep business is growing\nas much as it ever has. So, we’re not exactly sure if what ResMed is saying is that more people\nare going to the physician and this is a potential treatment. But whatever is happening, we’re not\nseeing a decline in (inaudible). That is just a fact.\nDoug Cooper\nAll right. Could I just focus, for the next comment -- question, just talking the resupply business.\nSo, I think, Casey, you mentioned that sleep is 17% of business, of overall revenue and the\nresupply -- 45% of that 17% is the resupply business. What can we expect from that resupply\nbusiness, in other words, as you grow your patient count, what can the resupply business grow\nto?\nAnd I’m assuming that’s a pretty profitable business, because there’s no real G&A associated\nwith it. It’s essentially a reorder business and fairly high gross margin business. So, is that one of\nthe keys, as well, that we saw in your EBITDA margin expansion, from 22% last quarter and 19%\na year ago, to the 24.5% this quarter?\nTodd Zehnder\nYeah. I’m going to try to unpack most of that, Doug. It’s 47% of current year -- or current quarter\nsleep revenue was driven by resupply. And our margins are somewhere in the mid-40s on that\npiece of the business. As you’ll remember, going back to our kind of national roll-out of sleep,\nover the last few years, it is clearly the piece of the business that you want to get to. The rental\npart of it, you can make money off of, but you got to get them complaint, you got to get the resupply\norder to come in.\nAnd then, it becomes more of your annuity, kind of low G&A, more technology and drop shipping.\nWhat we would say is, every month that we stack on another set of active patients in PAP -- and\nwe’re doing that every month, going forward, it’s only going to grow the future resupply market,\nand therefore, unless we just wildly accelerate our rental patients, the percentage of revenue\ncoming from resupply ought to just keep growing, quarter after quarter.\nI don’t what kind of terminal percentage of that looks like, for people who have been doing this,\ncall it, 10 years. But my guess is, probably somewhere up of two thirds of your revenue could be\ndriven by resupply. And that, ultimately, is going to really be good for that division, and the overall\nEBITDA/gross margin for VieMed. And yes, that expansion helped, along with pretty aggressive\ncost management that we’ve been doing around the country, and just scaling of the business.\nInComm Conferencing Page 10 of 13 www.incommconferencing.com\nBringing in HMP was, obviously, helpful to margins, as we’ve centralized some of their processes\nand got the economies of scale of VieMed within that organization, we’ve been able to drive their\nEBITDA margin, which is impacting. So, a lot of different things, but clearly, our focus on resupply\nand the sleep business and bringing in HMP’s resupply has been very beneficial to our bottom\nline.\nDoug Cooper\nOkay. And -- excellent -- and just my last question is just around the core vent business. Twelve\npercent, year-over-year growth in patient, which is solid, but it seems to me that, given you’re a\nmajor player in this, in the U.S., a top five player, the market seems still a little slow to be taking\noff to what we may expect, given the efficacy of the therapy. So, what is the bottleneck, in terms\nof the physicians looking to prescribe the therapy?\nCasey Hoyt\nYeah, I don’t think it’s -- I mean, look. It’s still going back to research and data, that -- which has\nalways been something that I’ve harped on, Doug. It’s amazing when we go into new areas, how\nwe’re still educating pulmonologists on the fact the available -- that this ventilation service is\navailable in the home for the patients. And so, that tells us that we’ve got to embrace the research\nand the studies that we have certainly put out.\nThe other thing that you’re seeing, which we consider a green pasture here, is that Medicare\nAdvantage is increasing. Okay? And while they only make up, I think -- they’re increasing with us,\ntoo. So we went from 11% to 12% this quarter on the payer mix. But they’re growing. They’re\nrepresenting 50% of Medicare right now. That’s why we’re so fired up about the 2024 rule,\nbecause right now, they tend to deny expensive care, just, without clinical reason.\nAnd so, they can -- we’ve gone through some denials with those guys on two ALS patients, for\nexample, that are on their death bed. And they’ve had a vent, and then, we go in for prior auth,\nand the Medicare Advantage plan for deny the re-auth. And so, that’s a sad situation. But that’s\none that is broken and the opportunity to fix it remains a great opportunity -- I mean, a great\nchallenge and opportunity for us, as well, to grow in the coming years.\nSo, as that rule, the way that rule works, is in 2024, Medicare Advantage has to follow Medicare\nclinical guidelines. And so, if they’re not, we’ll now have a forum to be transparent with Medicare\non who the bad actors are out there, that are denying this life-saving care. And so, those are --\nI’m being very blunt about, those are some of the struggles that we deal with on a day-to-day\nbasis. But it’s very -- it’s a big opportunity for growth for us, once we get those guys lined up with\nus. And I think it’ll happen.\nDoug Cooper\nOkay. That’s it for me, guys. Thanks very much.\nCasey Hoyt\nAll right, Doug.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Freeman with Raymond James.\nPlease proceed with your question.\nInComm Conferencing Page 11 of 13 www.incommconferencing.com\nMichael Freeman\nHey, Casey and Todd. Thanks so much for taking our questions. And congrats on the quarter and\nthe smooth integration of the -- of HMP. Just one quick one from me today, and it leaps off of the\nlast questions very nicely. How -- I’m looking at your diverse payer base. And this is strong in\nitself. And I’m looking -- I’m wondering how you might optimize this pair mix, moving forward?\nWhich of these payers is most accretive to VieMed? Like, how do you see this moving in the\nfuture? Thanks.\nCasey Hoyt\nI mean, you heard me talk about Humana and United in the past, Michael. Those guys are not in\nnetwork with us. I mean, some of that is our choice over theirs, just with -- with United, it’s rate\ndriven and it doesn’t make sense for us to do it at the rates that they pitch. And with Humana,\nthey’ve made a decision to try to go with a national, sole provider with Rotech and Aprium (ph).\nWe’re pretty bullish and confident that we’re going to have to wait and see how successful that is,\nto support the Humana network. We predict there’s going to be patient access to care issues. But\nwe’ll have to wait and see there. And so, those are the two, biggest payers that we would love to\nbe in network with. We’d love to be taking care of those folks. But frankly, we’ve never been in\nnetwork with them.\nSo that’s, like, historically, it’s not something that is in our numbers that we lost out on. It’s, like,\nwe’ve always been struggling with those two payers. And it's an opportunity, once again, a\nchallenge for us that is a great opportunity for us to fix, down the road. And look, when you’re\nsaving money, the more you put this non-invasive ventilation piece of equipment out on the patient\nat the right time, the more money you’ll save. Once they wake up to that, it’s a win-win for\neveryone. So we’ll get there at some point. It’s just taking time.\nMichael Freeman\nThat’s super helpful. I guess, going one level up and looking at the different segments of payers,\nfor instance, on your pie chart here -- Medicare, Medicaid, commercial, Medicare Advantage, and\nPrivate. What slices of that pie would VieMed be looking to expand and would be most accretive,\ngoing forward?\nTodd Zehnder\nI think the short answer is we’re looking to expand all of them, quite candidly. Because there is\nan under-served population in all of our products, across all of our payers. We think, probably,\nfrom a which piece of the pie will grow, from a percentage standpoint, like Casey was saying, the\nMedicare Advantage likely is the one that wins out, because there’s just more and more patients\nmoving into that program.\nAnd, historically, it has not made up as much of our payer base. At the end of the day, we don’t\ntake much bad business around here. And so, from an accretion standpoint, pretty much any\ndollar that comes into that pie chart is going to be making bottom-line money for us. So we’re not\n-- we don’t have a strategic objective to say we really want to grow this piece of it.\nMichael Freeman\nOkay. All right. That’s really helpful. Congrats on the quarter. And let’s hope the market catches\nup.\nInComm Conferencing Page 12 of 13 www.incommconferencing.com\nTodd Zehnder\nYep. Thank you, Michael.\nOperator\nThank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over\nto management for closing remarks.\nTodd Zehnder\nYeah, we just want to thank everybody for their time today. Follow-up with us if you have any\nquestions. And thanks, again, to all of our employees out there, producing these wonderful results\nthat we’re happy to share with the market. Thank you.\nOperator\nThis concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Nature of Business and Operations\nViemed Healthcare, Inc. (the \"Company\"), through its subsidiaries, is a provider of home medical equipment (\"HME\") and post-\nacute respiratory healthcare services in the United States. The Company’s primary service offerings are focused on effective in-\nhome treatment with clinical practitioners providing therapy and counseling to patients in their homes using cutting edge\ntechnology. The Company serves patients in all 50 states of the United States. The Company was incorporated under the Business\nCorporations Act (British Columbia) on December 14, 2016. The Company's registered and records office is located at Suite 2800,\nPark Place, 666 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia V6C 2Z7 and its corporate office is located at 625 E. Kaliste Saloom\nRoad, Lafayette, Louisiana 70508.\nThe Company is an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \"JOBS Act\"), and as\nsuch, has elected to comply with certain reduced U.S. public company reporting requirements.\nThe Company’s common shares are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \"VMD\".\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and\nfootnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements\nare unaudited, but reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals, which, in the opinion of management, are\nnecessary to present fairly the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nIncome, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity and Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nCash Flows for the interim periods presented. The Company's fiscal year ends on December 31. The Condensed Consolidated\nBalance Sheet as of December 31, 2023 was derived from audited consolidated financial statements but does not include all\ndisclosures required by GAAP. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual\nconsolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the report of the Company's independent registered public accounting\nfirm included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The nature of the Company's\nbusiness is such that the results of any interim period may not be indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries in which it has a controlling\nfinancial interest. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date\nof the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiod. Management bases these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience, existing and known circumstances,\nauthoritative accounting pronouncements and other factors that management believes to be reasonable. Significant areas requiring\nthe use of management estimates relate to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, income tax provisions, the fair value of\nfinancial instruments, and goodwill. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nPage 8\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company’s chief operating decision-makers (\"CODMs\") are its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, who make\nresource allocation decisions and assess performance based on financial information presented on an aggregate basis. There are\nno segment managers who are held accountable by the chief operating decision-makers, or anyone else, for any planning, strategy\nand key decision-making regarding operations. The corporate office is responsible for contract negotiation with vendors and\npayors, corporate compliance with healthcare laws and regulations, and revenue cycle management, among other corporate\nsupporting functions. Accordingly, the Company has a single reportable segment and operating segment structure based on ASC\n280, Segment Reporting.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable and revenues are based on contractually agreed-upon rates for services provided, reduced by estimated\nadjustments, including variable consideration for implicit price concessions. The accounts receivable are presented on the\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets net of the adjustments. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be\nrevised or updated as additional information becomes available. The complexity of third-party billing arrangements and laws and\nregulations governing Medicare and Medicaid may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded.\nThe Company performs a periodic analysis to review the valuation of accounts receivable and collectability of outstanding\nbalances. These estimates are determined utilizing historical realization data under a portfolio approach, which is then assessed by\nmanagement to evaluate whether adjustments should be made based on accounts receivable aging trends, other operating trends,\nand relevant business conditions such as governmental and managed care payor claims processing procedures.\nThe Company records a reserve for estimated probable losses as part of rental revenue adjustments in order to report rental\nrevenue at an expected collectable amount based on the total portfolio of operating lease receivables for which collectability has\nbeen deemed probable. The accounts receivable are presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets net of the\nadjustments.\nReceivables are considered past due when not collected by established due dates. Specific patient balances are written off after\ncollection efforts have been followed and the account has been determined to be uncollectible. Revisions in reserve estimates are\nrecorded as an adjustment to revenue in the period of revision.\nIncluded in accounts receivable at September 30, 2024 are amounts due from Medicare representing 23% of total outstanding net\nreceivables. As of December 31, 2023, 28% of total outstanding net receivables were amounts due from Medicare.\nInventory\nInventory represents non-serialized supplies that consist of equipment parts, consumables, and associated product supplies and is\nexpensed at the time of sale or use. The Company values inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Obsolete and\nunserviceable inventories are valued at estimated net realizable value.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at historic cost less accumulated\ndepreciation. Major renewals and improvements that extend the useful life of assets are capitalized to the respective property\naccounts, while maintenance and repairs, which do not extend the useful life of the respective assets, are expensed as incurred.\nManagement has estimated the useful lives of equipment leased to customers. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis\nover their estimated useful lives.\nDepreciation of medical equipment commences at the date of service, which represents the date that the asset has been delivered\nto a patient and is put in use and continues through the useful life of the asset. Property and equipment with definite useful lives are\ntested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nPage 9\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nEquity Investments\nEquity investments on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are primarily comprised of equity investments without readily\ndeterminable fair values accounted for under the measurement alternative described in ASC 321-10-35-2. For these investments,\nthe Company has elected the measurement alternative which measures the investment at cost, less any impairment. ASU 2019-04\nclarifies that if an entity identifies observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the\nsame issuer, it must measure its equity investment at fair value in accordance with ASC 820 as of the date that the observable\ntransaction occurred.\nThe balance of the Company’s equity investments was $1.8 million and $1.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively. The Company was not aware of any impairment or observable price change adjustments that needed to be\nmade as of September 30, 2024 on its investments in equity securities without a readily determinable fair value.\nDebt Investment\nThe Company's debt investment is a variable rate secured convertible note and is classified as an available-for-sale debt\ninstrument. Accrued interest is included in the amortized cost basis at each reporting period. At each financial statement date until a\nconversion event, the debt instrument is required to be remeasured at fair value. Changes in unrealized gains and losses are\naccounted for in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax effect, until realized. When changes are determined to be\nother than temporary in nature, the Company recognizes an other than temporary impairment expense in earnings equal to the\ndifference between the debt security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets include trade names and other identifiable intangible assets, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over a\nperiod of their expected useful lives, generally five years.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are principally derived from the rental and sale of HME products and services to patients.\nRental revenues\nRevenue generated from equipment that is rented to patients is recognized over the non-cancellable rental period (typically one\nmonth) and commences on delivery of the equipment to the patients. The agreements are evaluated at commencement and the\nstart of each monthly renewal period to determine if it is reasonably certain that the monthly renewal or purchase options would be\nexercised. The exercise of monthly renewal or purchase options by a patient has historically not been reasonably certain to occur\nat lease commencement or subsequent monthly renewals.\nRevenues are recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with payors, including private\ninsurers, prepaid health plans, Medicare, Medicaid and patients. Rental revenue, less estimated adjustments, is recognized as\nearned on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable lease term. Rental of patient equipment is billed on a monthly basis\nbeginning on the date the equipment is delivered. Since deliveries can occur on any day during a month, the amount of billings that\napply to the next month are deferred.\nThe Company's lease agreements generally contain lease components and non-lease components, which primarily relate to\nsupplies. The Company has made the accounting policy election to account for a lease component of an agreement and its\nassociated non-lease components as a single lease component based on the Company's assessment of classification of the lease\nbased on the consideration in the contract for the combined component.\nSales and Services revenues\nRevenue related to sales of equipment and supplies is recognized on the date of delivery as this is when control of the promised\ngoods is transferred to patients and is presented net of applicable sales taxes. Revenues are recorded only to the extent it is\nprobable that a significant reversal will not occur in the future as amounts may include implicit price concessions under\nreimbursement arrangements with payors, including private insurers, prepaid health plans, Medicare, Medicaid and patients. The\nsales transaction price is determined based on contractually agreed-upon rates, adjusted for estimates of variable consideration.\nPage 10\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe expected value method is used in determining the variable consideration as part of determining the sales transaction price\nusing historical reimbursement experience, historical sales returns, and other operating trends. Payment terms and conditions vary\nby contract. The timing of revenue recognition, billing, and cash collection generally results in billed and unbilled accounts\nreceivable.\nRevenues associated with external staffing services are accrued on an hourly basis and are recorded based on the determination\nof whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent. In arrangements in which the Company manages customers'\nsupplemental workforce needs utilizing its own network of healthcare professionals, the Company is determined to be a principal\nand includes the contractual gross billings in revenues with a corresponding increase to cost of revenues for worksite employee\npayroll costs associated with these services. Alternatively, when the Company acts as agent in the performance of workforce\nmanagement, revenue is recorded based on contractually agreed upon fees or commissions with no associated cost of revenues.\nThe revenues from each major source are summarized in the following table:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue from rentals\nVentilator rentals, non-invasive and invasive $ 31,772 $ 28,322 $ 91,404 $ 79,181\nOther home medical equipment rentals 12,459 11,119 35,604 26,441\nRevenue from sales and services\nEquipment and supply sales 8,440 7,742 21,956 19,287\nService revenues 5,333 2,219 14,598 7,360\nTotal revenues $ 58,004 $ 49,402 $ 163,562 $ 132,269\nRevenues from Medicare as percentages of the Company's total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023 were 44% and 45%, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, \"Compensation—Stock Compensation\",\nwhich establishes accounting for share-based awards exchanged for employee services and requires companies to expense the\nestimated fair value of these awards over the requisite employee service period. Stock–based compensation costs for stock\noptions are determined at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Stock-based compensation costs for\nrestricted stock units (\"RSUs\") are determined at the grant date based on the closing stock price. The expense of such stock-based\ncompensation awards is recognized using the graded vesting attribution method over the vesting period and the offsetting credit is\nrecorded as an increase in additional paid-in capital. Forfeitures are recorded as incurred. Any excess tax benefit or deficiency is\nrecognized as a component of income taxes and within operating cash flows upon vesting of the share-based award.\nFor the Company’s phantom share units settled in cash, the Company computes the fair value of the phantom share units using the\nclosing price of the Company's stock at the end of each period and records a liability based on the percentage of requisite service.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in numerous U.S. jurisdictions. The Company's income tax provisions reflect\nmanagement’s interpretation of country and state tax laws. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax\ndetermination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business and may remain uncertain for several years after their\noccurrence. The Company recognizes assets and liabilities for taxation when it is probable that the Company will receive refunds\nfrom or pay taxes to the relevant tax authority. Where the final determination of tax assets and liabilities is different from the\namounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income taxes provision in the period in\nwhich such a determination is made. Changes in tax law or changes in the way tax law is interpreted may also impact the\nCompany's effective tax rate as well as the Company's business and operations.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future income tax consequences attributable to temporary\ndifferences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases. Deferred\nincome tax assets or liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in\nwhich those temporary differences are expected to be settled. The calculation of current and deferred income taxes requires\nPage 11\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions and to exercise a certain amount of judgment concerning the carrying value of\nassets and liabilities. The current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are also impacted by expectations about future\noperating results and the timing of reversal of temporary differences as well as possible audits of tax filings by regulatory agencies.\nChanges or differences in these estimates or assumptions may result in changes to the current and deferred tax assets and\nliabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and a charge to or recovery of income tax expense.\nDeferred tax is recognized on any temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated\nfinancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable earnings. The effect of a change in the\nenacted tax rates is recognized in net earnings and comprehensive income or in equity depending on the item to which the\nadjustment relates. At each reporting period end, deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability based on whether it is more\nlikely than not that sufficient taxable earnings will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business acquisitions. The results of operations of the business\nacquired by the Company are included as of the respective acquisition date. The acquisition-date fair value of the consideration\ntransferred, including the fair value of any contingent consideration, is allocated to the underlying assets acquired, liabilities\nassumed, and noncontrolling interest in the acquiree based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. To the extent\nthe acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred exceeds the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible\nassets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests, such excess is allocated to goodwill. Patient relationships,\nmedical records and patient lists are not reported as separate intangible assets due to the regulatory requirements and lack of\ncontractual agreements but are part of goodwill. Customer related relationships are not reported as separate intangible assets but\nare part of goodwill as authorizing physicians are under no obligation to refer the Company’s services to their patients, who are free\nto change physicians and service providers at any time. The Company may adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as\nnecessary, as it obtains more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed that existed but were not available at\nthe acquisition date, which is generally up to one year after the acquisition closing date. Acquisition related costs are recognized\nseparately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill resulting from business combinations is not amortized, rather, it is assessed for impairment annually and upon the\noccurrence of a triggering event or change in circumstances indicating a possible impairment. Such triggering events potentially\nwarranting an annual or interim goodwill impairment assessment include, among other factors, declines in historical or projected\nrevenue, operating income or cash flows, and sustained decreases in the Company’s stock price or market capitalization. Such\nchanges in circumstance can include, among others, changes in the legal environment, reimbursement environment, operating\nperformance, and/or future prospects.\nThe Company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year. The impairment\nassessment can be performed on either a quantitative or qualitative basis. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to\ndetermine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. If determined necessary, the Company\napplies the quantitative impairment test to identify and measure the amount of impairment, if any. Fair value determinations require\nconsiderable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors, such as estimates of a reporting unit's\nfair value and judgment about impairment triggering events. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and\nassumptions made for purposes of the annual or interim goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company performed an assessment of qualitative factors and determined that no\nevents or circumstances existed that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived\nassets were less than the carrying amount. As such, a quantitative analysis was not required to be performed and the Company did\nnot record any goodwill impairment charges.\nThe Company follows ASC Topic 360, which requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the asset group’s carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In performing the review for\nrecoverability, if future undiscounted cash flows (excluding interest charges) from the use and ultimate disposition of the assets are\nless than their carrying values, an impairment loss represented by the difference between its fair value and carrying value, is\nrecognized. When properties are classified as held for sale, they are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or the expected\nsales price less costs to sell.\nThere were no impairment charges to goodwill or long-lived assets recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand September 30, 2023.\nPage 12\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nNet Income per Share Attributable to Viemed Healthcare, Inc.'s Common Stockholders\nBasic net income per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during\nthe period. Diluted net income per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the\neffect of dilutive stock-based awards outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive stock-based awards\ninclude outstanding common stock options and time-based RSUs.\nSee Note 11 for earnings per share computations.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, Liabilities — Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of\nSupplier Finance Program Obligations, which requires entities that use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase\nof goods and services to disclose the key terms of the programs and information about their obligations that are outstanding at the\nend of the reporting period. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022,\nincluding interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company adopted this standard during the year ended December 31, 2023, which\ndid not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company” as defined by the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth\ncompany can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can selectively\ndelay the adoption of all accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company\nhas elected to utilize this exemption and, as a result, the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements may not be\ncomparable to the financial statements of issuers that are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting\nstandards that are applicable to public companies. To date, however, the Company has not delayed the adoption of any accounting\nstandards. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that the Company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period at any\ntime, which election is irrevocable.\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-09,\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which is intended to improve the transparency of income tax\ndisclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the effective tax rate reconciliation and\nincome taxes paid by jurisdiction. The ASU is effective for public business entities' annual periods beginning after December 15,\n2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nPage 13\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\n3. Business Combinations\nEast Alabama HomeMed, LLC\nOn April 1, 2024, the Company acquired a controlling 60% equity interest in East Alabama HomeMed, LLC (\"HomeMed\"). The\nacquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805. As a result of the\nacquisition, goodwill of $3.2 million and a trade name of $0.4 million were recognized. The Company expects its portion of the\ngoodwill to be fully tax-deductible. Additionally, a noncontrolling interest of $1.8 million was recorded at the acquisition date. The\naccompanying financial statements include the results of HomeMed's operations from the acquisition date. Changes in the\nnoncontrolling interests after the acquisition date are accounted for pursuant to ASC 810, Consolidation.\nHome Medical Products, Inc.\nOn June 1, 2023, Viemed, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the acquisition of Home Medical Products,\nInc., (“HMP”), which operates in Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi. The Company acquired 100% of the equity ownership of\nHMP in exchange for approximately $29 million in cash or cash payable, subject to customary post-closing net working capital and\nother adjustments.

The proceeds of the 2022 Term Loan Facility and any additional term\nloans established in accordance with the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities may be used to finance permitted acquisitions and to pay\ntransaction fees, costs and expenses related to such acquisitions.\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are a forward looking term rate based on a secured\novernight financing rate (\"Term SOFR\") plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.625% to 3.375%, or, at the option of the\nCompany, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 1.625% to\n2.375%.\nThe 2022 Senior Credit Facilities require the Company to comply with certain affirmative, as well as certain negative covenants\nthat, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make\ninvestments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations and pay dividends and other restricted payments. The 2022 Senior\nCredit Facilities also include certain financial covenants, which generally include, but are not limited to the following:\n• Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (defined generally as total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than (i) for\nany fiscal quarter ending during the period from the closing date to and including December 31, 2024, 2.75 to 1.0 and (ii)\nfor any fiscal quarter ending on and after March 31, 2025, 2.50 to 1.0, subject to certain adjustments following a material\nacquisition.\n• Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (defined generally as (a) adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditures minus\ncash taxes to (b) the sum of scheduled principal payments plus cash interest expense plus restricted payments) of not\nless than 1.25:1.0.\nThe Company was in compliance with all covenants under the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities in effect at September 30, 2024.\nThe 2022 Senior Credit Facilities include provisions permitting the Company from time to time to, subject to certain terms and\nconditions, increase the aggregate amount of commitments under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility and/or establish one or more\nadditional term loans under the 2022 Term Loan Facility, in each case, with additional commitments from existing lenders or new\ncommitments from financial institutions acceptable to the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion; provided, that, (a) the\naggregate principal amount of any increases in the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, and (b) the aggregate principal amount of all\nadditional term loans under the 2022 Term Loan Facility established after the closing date will not exceed $30.0 million.\nPage 16\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nFinancing costs related to the issuance and amendments of 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are capitalized and amortized over the\nterm of the loans using the effective interest method. Upon the initial draw of debt under the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities during the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, the Company reclassified the deferred financing fees previously recorded in other long-term\nassets to long-term debt in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nOn May 28, 2024, the Company entered into a First Amendment to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities that (a) extends the delayed\ndraw term loan commitment expiration date to November 29, 2025, from its initial expiration date of May 29, 2024, and (b) provides\nfor other technical amendments. Payment for debt issuance costs associated with the amendment was $0.2 million during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024.\nMedical Equipment Financing\nThe Company enters into medical equipment financing obligations through supplier finance programs. The financing obligations\nare primarily short term in nature and are payable in monthly installments. As of September 30, 2024, $0.4 million of the\noutstanding medical equipment financing is presented on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as short term debt based\non the scheduled repayment dates.\nLeases\nThe Company has recognized finance lease liabilities for vehicles and operating leases for land and buildings that have terms\ngreater than twelve months, as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nLease liabilities $ 2,796 $ 3,250\nLess:\nCurrent portion of lease liabilities (811) (934)\nNet long-term lease liabilities $ 1,985 $ 2,316\nOperating Lease Liabilities\nThe Company has recognized operating lease liabilities that relate primarily to the lease of land and buildings. The exercise of\nlease renewal options is at the Company's sole discretion and is included in the lease term for calculations of its right-of-use assets\nand liabilities when it is reasonably certain that the Company plans to renew these leases. These lease liabilities are recorded at\npresent value based on a discount rate of 5.5%, which was based on the Company's incremental borrowing rate at the time of\nassessment. At September 30, 2024, the weighted average lease term was approximately 3.79 years.\nFuture maturities of the Company's operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2024 are summarized as follows:\nLease Liability\n2024 $ 225\n2025 908\n2026 783\n2027 667\n2028 573\nThereafter 7\nTotal lease payments $ 3,163\nLess: imputed interest 436\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 2,727\nOperating rental expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to $1.1 million.\nPage 17\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\n7. Fair Value Measurement\nUnder ASC Topic 820, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (i.e., an exit price). ASC Topic 820 establishes a\nhierarchy for inputs to valuation techniques used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and\nminimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. There are three\nlevels to the hierarchy based on the reliability of inputs, as follows:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or\nsimilar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value\nis greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3.\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe Company measures certain assets at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no transfers between fair value measurement\nlevels during any presented period.\nThe following tables summarize the Company's assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023:\nAt September 30, 2024\n(In thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements:\nMoney market mutual funds $ 2,024 $ — $ — $ 2,024\nAvailable for sale debt instrument — — 875 875\nTotal $ 2,024 $ — $ 875 $ 2,899\nAt December 31, 2023\n(In thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements:\nMoney market mutual funds $ 5,657 $ — $ — $ 5,657\nAvailable for sale debt instrument $ — $ — $ 2,219 $ 2,219\nTotal $ 5,657 $ — $ 2,219 $ 7,876\nAvailable for Sale Debt Instrument\nThe fair value of the Company’s available for sale debt instrument is classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the\nCompany evaluates adjustments using a combination of observable and unobservable inputs, such as operating results of the\ncounterparty as well observable prices in transactions of debt and equity instruments of the issuing counterparty when available. As\nof September 30, 2024, the analysis resulted in the determination that the decline in fair value was an other than temporary\nimpairment (OTTI). Accordingly, the Company recognized an OTTI loss of $0.1 million in Income (expense) from investments\nduring the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The recognized loss is equal to the difference between the debt security’s amortized\ncost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date, based on management's estimate of fair value.\nPage 18\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nThe Company measures certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets include other equity investments and\nthe fair value allocation related to the Company’s acquisitions.\nThe Company's other equity investments are holdings in privately-held companies without a readily determinable market value. The\nCompany remeasures equity securities without readily determinable fair value at fair value when an orderly transaction is identified\nfor an identical or similar investment of the same issuer in accordance with the measurement alternative under Topic 820. ASU\n2019-04 states that the measurement alternative is a nonrecurring fair value measurement. Accordingly, other equity investments\nwithout readily determinable fair value are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because the Company estimates the\nvalue using a combination of observable and unobservable inputs, including valuation ascribed to the issuing company in\nsubsequent financing rounds, volatility in the results of operations of the issuers and rights and obligations of the holdings the\nCompany owns. The Company had no material adjustments of other equity investments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring\nbasis during any of the periods presented.\nThe fair value allocation related to the Company’s acquisitions are determined using a discounted cash flow approach, or a\nreplacement cost approach, which are based on significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). These valuation methods required\nmanagement to make various assumptions, including, but not limited to, future profitability, cash flows, replacement costs, and\ndiscount rates. The Company’s estimates are based upon historical trends, management’s knowledge and experience and overall\neconomic factors, including projections of future earnings potential. Developing discounted future cash flows in applying the income\napproach requires the Company to evaluate its intermediate to longer-term strategies, including, but not limited to, estimates of\nrevenue growth, operating margins, capital requirements, inflation and working capital management. The development of\nappropriate rates to discount the estimated future cash flows requires the selection of risk premiums, which can materially impact\nthe present value of future cash flows.\nThe Company estimated the fair value of acquired identifiable intangible assets using discounted cash flow techniques that\nincluded an estimate of future cash flows, consistent with overall cash flow projections used to determine the purchase price paid to\nacquire the business, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows. The Company estimated the fair\nvalue of certain acquired identifiable intangible assets based on the cost approach using estimated costs consistent with historical\nexperience. The Company believes the estimates and assumptions used in the valuation methods are reasonable.\nThere were no transfers between fair value measurement levels during any presented period.\nPage 19\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\n8. Shareholders' Equity\nAuthorized Share Capital\nThe Company’s authorized share capital consists of an unlimited number of common shares, with no stated par value.\nIssued and Outstanding Share Capital\nThe Company has only one class of stock outstanding, common shares. The authorized stock consists of an unlimited number of\ncommon shares with no stated par value, of which 38,932,247 and 38,506,161 shares were issued and outstanding as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe Company acquired and cancelled 142,489 common shares at a cost of $1.1 million to satisfy employee income tax withholding\nassociated with RSUs vesting during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company’s retained earnings were reduced\nby the amount paid for the shares repurchased and cancelled.\nStock-Based Compensation\nOn June 6, 2024 (the \"Effective Date\"), the Company’s shareholders approved the Company's 2024 Long Term Incentive Plan (the\n\"2024 Omnibus Plan\") to provide an incentive to attract, retain, and reward directors, officers, employees, and consultants who\nprovide services to the Company or any of its subsidiaries. All directors, officers, employees, and consultants of the Company and/\nor its affiliates are eligible to receive awards under the 2024 Omnibus Plan, subject to its terms. Awards include common share\npurchase options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, performance awards, or other stock-based awards, including restricted\nstock units, deferred stock units, and dividends and dividend equivalents. The maximum number of common shares that will be\navailable for awards and issuance under the 2024 Omnibus Plan and that may be reserved for issuance at any time, including\nunder previous plans such as the 2020 Long Term Incentive Plan (effective June 11, 2020), the Amended and Restated Stock\nOption Plan (effective as of July 17, 2018), the Amended and Restated Restricted Share Unit Plan (effective as of July 17, 2018),\nand the Deferred Share Unit Plan (effective July 17, 2018), will be 7,800,000 shares. The maximum amount of common shares that\nmay be awarded under the 2024 Omnibus Plan as “incentive stock options” is 1,000,000 common shares. As of September 30,\n2024, the Company had outstanding options of 4,124,000 and RSUs of 1,547,000 associated with common shares under the\nexisting plans.\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023 (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nStock-based compensation - options $ 61 $ 263 $ 231 $ 911\nStock-based compensation - restricted stock units 1,651 1,190 4,533 3,404\nTotal $ 1,712 $ 1,453 $ 4,764 $ 4,315\nAt September 30, 2024, there was approximately $83,000 of total unrecognized pre-tax stock option expense under the Company's\nequity compensation plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.45 years. As of September 30,\n2024, there was approximately $5,920,000 of total unrecognized pre-tax compensation expense related to outstanding time-based\nrestricted stock units that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.43 years.\nPage 20\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nOptions\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nNumber of Weighted average\noptions Weighted average remaining Aggregate\n(000's) exercise price(1) contractual life intrinsic value(2)\nBalance December 31, 2023 4,214 $ 5.25 5.9 years $ 11,698\nIssued — —\nExercised (82) 5.10\nExpired / Forfeited (8) 5.21\nBalance September 30, 2024 4,124 $ 5.25 5.1 years $ 9,725\n(1)For presentation purposes, stock options issued with a Canadian dollar exercise price have been translated to U.S. dollars based on the\nprevailing exchange rate on the date of grant.\n(2)The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding represents the difference between the exercise price of the option and the closing price of the\nCompany's common shares on the last trading day of the period ($7.33 and $7.85 on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively).\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding was $9,725,000 and options exercisable was $9,226,000 at September 30,\n2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 81,646 common shares were issued pursuant to the exercise of stock\noptions.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had 3,874,000 exercisable stock options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price\nof $5.24 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.0 years. At December 31, 2023, the Company had 3,461,000\nexercisable stock options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $4.99 and a weighted average remaining\ncontractual life of 5.5 years.\nThe fair value of the stock options has been charged to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and credited to\nadditional paid-in capital over the vesting period, using the grant date fair value based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nThe assumptions used to determine the grant date fair value of stock options include exercise price, risk-free interest rates,\nexpected volatility, and average life of an option. The risk-free interest rates are based on the rates available at the time of the grant\nfor zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the option’s expected life. The average life of an option is\nbased on both historical and projected exercise and lapsing data. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded\noptions on the Company's common shares and historical volatility of the Company's common shares over the expected life of the\noption. There were no issuances of options during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe Company accounts for RSUs using fair value. The fair value of the RSUs has been charged to the Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Income and credited to additional paid-in capital over the vesting period, based on the stock price on the date of\ngrant. RSUs vest generally over a one or three-year period. The Company accounts for forfeitures of RSUs under ASU 2016-09\nand recognizes forfeitures in the period in which they occur.\nThe following table summarizes RSU activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nWeighted\nWeighted average Aggregate\nNumber of average grant remaining intrinsic\nRSUs (000's) price contractual life value(1)\nBalance December 31, 2023 1,226 $ 7.23 0.86 years $ 9,624\nIssued 915 8.18\nVested (487) 7.07\nForfeited (107) 7.88\nBalance September 30, 2024 1,547 $ 7.80 1.43 years $ 11,340\n(1)The aggregate intrinsic value of time-based RSUs outstanding was based on the closing price of the Company's common shares on the last\ntrading day of the period ($7.33 and $7.85 on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively).\nPage 21\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 117,417 RSUs with vestings over a one to three year\nperiod and a fair value of $0.9 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 915,000 RSUs\nwith vestings over a one to three year period and a fair value of $7.3 million.\nPhantom Share Units\nThe Company has a phantom share unit plan, which it uses for grants to directors, officers, and employees. Phantom share units\ngranted under the plan are non-assignable and are settled in cash at vesting based on the fair value of the Company's common\nstock on the vesting date. Phantom share units vest annually over a three-year period. The cash-settled phantom share units are\naccounted for as liability awards and are re-measured at fair value each reporting period until they become vested with accrued\nliability and related expense being recognized over the requisite service period.\nThe following table summarizes phantom share unit activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nNumber of phantom Value of share\nshare units (000's) equivalents(1)\nBalance December 31, 2023 418 $ 3,281\nIssued 268 2,161\nVested (218) 1,607\nForfeited (16) (120)\nBalance September 30, 2024 452 $ 3,313\n(1)The value of outstanding share equivalents at the beginning of the period is based on the market price of the Company’s common shares at that\ntime, the value of issued share equivalents is based on the market price of the Company’s common shares at issuance, the value of vested share\nequivalents is based on the cash paid at the time of vesting, and the values of forfeited share equivalents and outstanding share equivalents at the\nend of the period are based on the market price of the Company's common shares at the end of the period. The market price of the Company's\ncommon shares was $7.33 and $7.85 on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe change in fair value of the phantom share units has been charged to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and\nrecorded as a liability included in accrued liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities. The total liability associated with phantom\nshare units at September 30, 2024 is $1,989,000, with $1,337,000 of this amount included in current accrued liabilities and the\nremaining portion of $652,000 included in long-term accrued liabilities.\nThe impact associated with the fair value re-measurement of phantom share units is recorded in selling, general and administrative\nexpenses within the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The following table summarizes expense (benefit)\nassociated with the phantom share units for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSelling, general, and administrative $ 619 $ (333) $ 1,172 $ 1,504\nThe Company paid cash settlements of $1.6 million and $2.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, pertaining to vestings of cash-settled phantom share units.\nPage 22\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\n9. Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company accrues estimates for resolution of any legal and other contingencies when losses are probable and reasonably\nestimable in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies (“ASC 450”). No less than quarterly, the Company reviews the status of\neach significant matter underlying a legal proceeding or claim and assess our potential financial exposure. The Company accrues a\nliability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any legal proceeding or claim is considered probable and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether\nthe amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable, and accruals are based only on the information available to the Company at\nthe time the judgment is made, which may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate or unanticipated events and circumstances may\noccur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, the outcome of legal proceedings is\ninherently uncertain, and we may incur substantial defense costs and expenses defending any of these matters.\nLegal Proceedings\nAs previously disclosed, on November 5, 2020, the Company (through its subsidiary Sleep Management LLC) filed a lawsuit\nagainst Vyaire Medical, Inc. d/b/a CareFusion Respiratory Technologies (“Vyaire”) in the 15th Judicial District Court for the Parish of\nLafayette, Louisiana (the “State Court”) seeking damages for breach of contract and seeking declaratory judgment. The State Court\nissued an order on September 5, 2023 granting the Company Partial Summary Judgment finding that Vyaire breached the contract.\nOn June 9, 2024, Vyaire and certain of its affiliates filed voluntary bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the US\nBankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”).\nA liquidation analysis subsequently submitted to the Bankruptcy Court disclosed that unsecured claims, including those subordinate\nto the super-priority claims of certain Vyaire creditors, would not receive any recovery under the proposed Chapter 11\nreorganization plan or in the event of a Chapter 7 liquidation. Consequently, collection of the Company's unsecured claim against\nVyaire was determined to be not probable. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, outstanding funds receivable in the\namount of $0.9 million related to undelivered respiratory equipment were impaired through Other expense (income).\nGovernmental and Regulatory Matters\nFrom time to time the Company is involved in various external governmental investigations, audits and reviews. Reviews, audits\nand investigations of this sort can lead to government actions, which can result in the assessment of recoupment of\nreimbursement, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way the Company\nconducts business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs.\n10. Income Taxes\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded income tax expense of $2.9 million, which includes a\ndiscrete tax benefit of $0.1 million associated with stock-based compensation arrangements. Excluding the impact of the discrete\ntaxes, the effective rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is 30.3%. The effective rate differs from the amount\ncomputed by applying the statutory federal and state income tax rates to ordinary income before the provision for income taxes due\nto permanent non-deductible differences. The Company's effective tax rate is based on forecasted annual results which may\nfluctuate significantly through the rest of the year.\nAt September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no amounts recorded for uncertain tax positions and does not expect any\nmaterial changes in uncertain tax benefits during the next 12 months. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to\nincome tax matters in income tax expense. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in various\nstates. The Company is generally not subject to examination by taxing authorities for years prior to 2021.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that the Company believes that these assets are more likely than not to\nbe realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future\nreversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent\noperations.\nPage 23\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\n11. Earnings Per Share\nIncome per common share is calculated using earnings for the year divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding\nduring the year. Using the treasury stock method, diluted income per share amounts are calculated giving effect to the potential\ndilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to issue common shares were exercised or converted to common shares by\nassuming the proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs are used to purchase common shares\nat the prevailing market rate.\nThe following reflects the earnings and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:\nThree Months Ended September Nine Months Ended September\n30, 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator - basic and diluted:\nNet income attributable to Viemed Healthcare, Inc. $ 3,878 $ 2,919 $ 6,949 $ 6,766\nDenominator:\nBasic weighted-average number of common shares 38,870,823 38,438,058 38,803,887 38,307,343\nDiluted weighted-average number of shares 40,779,414 40,420,615 40,702,001 40,391,729\nBasic earnings per share $ 0.10 $ 0.08 $ 0.18 $ 0.18\nDiluted earnings per share $ 0.10 $ 0.07 $ 0.17 $ 0.17\nDenominator calculation from basic to diluted:\nBasic weighted-average number of common shares 38,870,823 38,438,058 38,803,887 38,307,343\nStock options and other dilutive securities 1,908,591 1,982,557 1,898,114 2,084,386\nDiluted weighted-average number of shares 40,779,414 40,420,615 40,702,001 40,391,729\nAnti-dilutive shares excluded from the calculation consisted of dilutive employee stock options and RSUs that were de minimis in all\nperiods presented.\nPage 24\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nItem 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with, and is\nqualified entirely by, our condensed consolidated financial statements (including Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements) and the other consolidated financial information under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Some of the\ninformation in this discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Actual results\nand timing of events could differ from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the\nfollowing discussion and analysis.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements and information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the\nmeaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or \"forward-looking information\" as such term is defined in\napplicable Canadian securities legislation (collectively, \"forward-looking statements\"). Any statements other than statements of\nhistorical information, including those that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives,\nassumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking and may involve estimates,\nassumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-\nlooking statements. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly\nupdate or revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events\nor otherwise, except as required by applicable law.\nForward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance and reflect the expectations or beliefs of management\nregarding future events, and include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: operating results; profitability; financial\ncondition and resources; anticipated needs for working capital; liquidity; capital resources; capital expenditures; milestones;\nlicensing milestones; information with respect to future growth and growth strategies; anticipated trends in our industry; our future\nfinancing plans; timelines; currency fluctuations; government regulation; unanticipated expenses; commercial disputes or claims;\nlimitations on insurance coverage or other reimbursement; and availability of cash flow to fund capital requirements. Often, but not\nalways, forward-looking information can be identified by the use of words such as “plans”, “expects”, “is expected”, “budget”,\n“potential”, “scheduled”, “estimates”, “forecasts”, “intends”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “projects”, or the negatives thereof or variations\nof such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results “will”, “should”, “may”, “could”, “would”, “might” or\n“will be taken”, “occur” or “be achieved” or the negative of these terms or comparable terminology.\nForward-looking statements are based on the reasonable assumptions, estimates, analysis and opinions of management made in\nlight of its experience and its perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments, as well as other factors that\nmanagement believes to be relevant and reasonable in the circumstances at the date that such statements are made, but which\nmay prove to be incorrect. We believe that the assumptions and expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are\nreasonable. We cannot assure you, however, that such statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events\ncould differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-\nlooking statements.\nBy their nature, forward-looking statements involve numerous assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and\nspecific, including those identified under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the other\ndocuments we file with the SEC, including under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, and with the securities regulatory authorities in certain provinces of Canada, which contribute to the possibility\nthat the predicted outcomes may not occur or may be delayed. The risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are\nbeyond our control, that could influence actual results include, but are not limited to: the general business, market and economic\nconditions in the regions in which the we operate; significant capital requirements and operating risks that we may be subject to;\nour ability to implement business strategies and pursue business opportunities; volatility in the market price of our common shares;\nthe state of the capital markets; the availability of funds and resources to pursue operations; inflation; reductions in reimbursement\nrates and audits of reimbursement claims by various governmental and private payor entities; dependence on few payors; possible\nnew drug discoveries; dependence on key suppliers; granting of permits and licenses in a highly regulated business; competition;\ndisruptions in or attacks (including cyber-attacks) on our information technology, internet, network access or other voice or data\ncommunications systems or services; the evolution of various types of fraud or other criminal behavior to which we are exposed;\ndifficulty integrating newly acquired businesses; the impact of new and changes to, or application of, current laws and regulations;\nthe overall difficult litigation and regulatory environment; increased competition; increased funding costs and market volatility due to\nmarket illiquidity and competition for funding; critical accounting estimates and changes to accounting standards, policies, and\nmethods used by us; our status as an emerging growth company; and the occurrence of natural and unnatural catastrophic events\nor health epidemics or concerns, and claims resulting from such events or concerns, as well as other general economic, market\nand business conditions; and other factors beyond our control.\nPage 25\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nGeneral Matters\nIn this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" and \"our\" refer\nto Viemed Healthcare, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nWe were incorporated on December 14, 2016 pursuant to the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). As of June 30, 2020,\nwe determined that we no longer qualify as a \"foreign private issuer,\" as defined in Rule 3b-4 of the Exchange Act, for the purposes\nof the informational requirements of the Exchange Act. As a result, effective January 1, 2021, we became subject to the proxy\nsolicitation rules under Section 14 of the Exchange Act and Regulation FD, and our officers, directors, and principal shareholders\nbecame subject to the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. We will\ncontinue to file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K with the SEC and\nwith the relevant Canadian securities regulatory authorities on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval\n(SEDAR).\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the JOBS Act, and as such, we have elected to comply with certain reduced\nU.S. public company reporting requirements.\nOverview\nWe provide an array of home medical equipment, services and supplies, specializing in post-acute respiratory care services in the\nUnited States. Our primary objective is to focus on the organic growth of the business and thereby solidify our position as one of\nthe United States’ largest providers of in-home therapy for patients suffering from respiratory diseases. Our respiratory care\nprograms are designed specifically for payors to have the ability to treat patients in the home for less total cost and with a superior\nquality of care. Our services include respiratory disease management (through the rental of various HME devices), neuromuscular\ncare, in-home sleep testing and sleep apnea treatment, oxygen therapy, and the sale of associated supplies.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue through the rental of non-invasive and invasive ventilators which represented 54.8% and\n57.3% of our revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 55.9% and 59.9% for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We combine the benefits of home ventilation support with licensed\nRespiratory Therapists (\"RTs\") to drive improved patient outcomes and reduce costly hospital readmissions.\nWe expect to grow through expansion of existing service areas as well as in new territories through a cost efficient launch that\nreduces location expenses. We currently serve patients in all 50 states. We expect to continue to employ more RTs in order to\nassure our high service model is accomplished in the home. As of September 30, 2024, we employed 398 licensed RTs,\nrepresenting approximately 35% of our company-wide employee count. By focusing overhead costs on personnel that service the\npatient rather than physical location costs, we anticipate that we will efficiently scale our business in regions that are currently not\nbeing effectively serviced.\nThe continued trend of servicing patients in the home rather than in hospitals is aligned with our business objective and we\nanticipate that this trend will continue to offer growth opportunities for us. We expect to continue to be a solution to the rising health\ncosts in the United States by offering more cost effective, home based solutions while increasing the quality of life for patients\nfighting serious respiratory diseases.\nPage 26\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nTrends Affecting our Business\nHome medical equipment markets are witnessing sustained expansion, with a notable focus on the complex respiratory and\nObstructive Sleep Apnea (\"OSA\") device segments. Analysts in the industry anticipate a consistent and robust growth trajectory,\nprojecting Compound Annual Growth Rates (\"CAGR\") of approximately 6% for respiratory devices and 8% for OSA devices. This\nupward trend underscores the increasing demand for innovative solutions in respiratory care and sleep apnea management,\nhighlighting the industry's responsiveness to evolving healthcare needs. As technological advancements and awareness drive the\nadoption of these specialized devices, we believe the HME markets, particularly in respiratory and OSA, are positioned for\ncontinuous expansion, offering promising opportunities for both providers and consumers alike.\nThe aging population remains a pivotal driver for the industry, as the elderly, constituting a substantial portion of HME patients, are\nexpected to represent a higher percentage of the overall population. Projections from industry analysts indicate a consistent annual\ngrowth in the number of Medicare beneficiaries, contributing to ongoing patient volume growth. A significant contributing factor to\nthe industry's growth is the rising incidence of chronic diseases. Factors such as increasing obesity rates, consequences of past\nsmoking prevalence, under-diagnosis of certain health conditions, and higher diagnosis rates for chronic diseases collectively\nshape the industry. There is a notable shift towards home-based treatment for these conditions.\nThe industry is undergoing a transition to value-based healthcare, with both government and commercial payors increasingly\nadopting models that emphasize the transition of patients from acute care settings to home care. We believe HME providers are\nwell-positioned to benefit from this industry shift. Advancements in technology and medical equipment have led to an increased\nprevalence of in-home treatments. The broader range of treatments administered in patient homes is expected to continue growing.\nProjections from industry analysts indicate that U.S. home healthcare spending will increase, reaching $250 billion by 2031, with a\nCAGR of approximately 7%.\nMarket consolidation is a notable trend favoring larger, financially stable players. The decline in the number of smaller regional\nplayers is attributed to the capital investment and scale required to compete effectively. This has led to a more consolidated and\ncompetitive landscape in the DME market.\nDespite these positive trends, the industry faces challenges such as cost containment efforts of payors. The consolidation of\nmanaged care payors into larger purchasing groups has increased negotiating power, resulting in pricing pressure on HME\nproviders. In addition to ongoing negotiations relating to contract management with third party payors to secure fair reimbursement,\nHME providers are engaging in value-based contracting, focusing on outcomes and patient satisfaction. These value-based\ncontracts leverage data analytics to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and quality of durable medical goods and provide\nevidence-based data to payors demonstrating the long-term benefits and cost savings associated with the use of certain medical\ngoods.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe Company faces current and potential future inflationary pressures driven by factors such as general cost increases, supply\nchain disruptions, and governmental policies. The manufacturing and distribution costs of Viemed's patient equipment are affected\nby rising material, labor, and transportation expenses, including fuel costs. Persistent inflation may impact overall demand, increase\noperating costs, and affect profit margins, potentially adversely affecting Viemed's business and financial performance.\nIn its 2024 DMEPOS Fee Schedule, CMS announced the fee schedule adjustment based on the annual change to the Consumer\nPricing Index for all urban areas. Items that were subject to the competitive bidding program in former competitive bidding areas\nwill receive a 2.9% reimbursement rate increase. Items that were subject to the competitive bidding program in non-competitive\nbidding areas received a 3.0% reimbursement rate increase. Items not subject to the competitive bidding program received a 2.6%\nreimbursement rate increase.\nFuture volatility in general price inflation and its impact on material availability, shipping, warehousing, and operational overhead\ncould further impact financial results. Viemed attempts to address these pressures through its inflation-linked reimbursement\ncontracts, negotiation, leveraging its purchasing power and embracing technology, such as its proprietary clinical management\nplatform.\nPage 27\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe below table highlights summary financial and operational metrics for the last eight quarters.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except vent patients)\nSeptember 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31,\nFor the quarter ended 2024 2024 2024 2023 2023 2023 2023 2022\nFinancial Information:\nRevenue $ 58,004 $ 54,965 $ 50,593 $ 50,739 $ 49,402 $ 43,311 $ 39,556 $ 37,508\nGross Profit 34,371 32,892 29,802 32,111 30,562 26,106 24,004 22,896\nGross Profit % 59 % 60 % 59 % 63 % 62 % 60 % 61 % 61 %\nNet Income 3,905 1,477 1,603 3,477 2,919 2,330 1,517 2,438\nCash (As of) 11,347 8,807 7,309 12,839 10,078 10,224 23,544 16,914\nTotal Assets (As of) 169,526 163,947 154,875 154,895 149,400 149,117 124,634 117,043\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) 13,954 12,813 10,098 12,845 12,081 9,810 8,328 9,306\nOperational Information:\nVent Patients(2) 11,374 10,905 10,450 10,327 10,244 10,005 9,337 9,306\n(1) Refer to \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section below for definition of Adjusted EBITDA.\n(2) Vent Patients represents the number of active ventilator patients on recurring billing service at the end of each calendar quarter.\nPage 28\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n% of Total % of Total $ %\n2024 Revenue 2023 Revenue Change Change\nRevenue $ 58,004 100.0 % $ 49,402 100.0 % $ 8,602 17.4 %\nCost of revenue 23,633 40.7 % 18,840 38.1 % 4,793 25.4 %\nGross profit 34,371 59.3 % 30,562 61.9 % 3,809 12.5 %\nSelling, general and administrative 26,671 46.0 % 23,654 47.9 % 3,017 12.8 %\nResearch and development 757 1.3 % 593 1.2 % 164 27.7 %\nStock-based compensation 1,712 3.0 % 1,453 2.9 % 259 17.8 %\nDepreciation and amortization 348 0.6 % 419 0.8 % (71) (16.9) %\nLoss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment (469) (0.8) % 278 0.6 % (747) (268.7) %\nOther expense (income), net (276) (0.5) % (41) (0.1) % (235) 573.2 %\nIncome from operations 5,628 9.7 % 4,206 8.5 % 1,422 33.8 %\nNon-operating income and expenses\nIncome (expense) from investments 96 0.2 % 270 0.5 % (174) (64.4) %\nInterest expense, net (225) (0.4) % (237) (0.5) % 12 (5.1) %\nNet income before taxes 5,499 9.5 % 4,239 8.6 % 1,260 29.7 %\nProvision for income taxes 1,594 2.7 % 1,320 2.7 % 274 20.8 %\nNet income 3,905 6.7 % 2,919 5.9 % 986 33.8 %\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest 27 — % — — % 27 NM\nNet income attributable to Viemed Healthcare, Inc. $ 3,878 6.7 % $ 2,919 5.9 % $ 959 32.9 %\nRevenue\nThe following table summarizes our revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n% of Total % of Total $ %\n2024 Revenue 2023 Revenue Change Change\nRevenue from rentals\nVentilator rentals, non-invasive and invasive $ 31,772 54.8 % $ 28,322 57.3 % $ 3,450 12.2 %\nOther home medical equipment rentals 12,459 21.5 % 11,119 22.6 % 1,340 12.1 %\nRevenue from sales and services\nEquipment and supply sales 8,440 14.6 % 7,742 15.7 % 698 9.0 %\nService revenues 5,333 9.2 % 2,219 4.5 % 3,114 140.3 %\nTotal revenue $ 58,004 100.0 % $ 49,402 100.0 % $ 8,602 17.4 %\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue totaled $58.0 million, an increase of $8.6 million (or 17.4%) from the\ncomparable period in 2023. The primary driver of this growth was our ventilator rental revenue, which increased by $3.5\nmillion (or 12.2%) due to higher patient volumes associated with strong demand for ventilation services. Additionally, services\nrevenue saw a notable increase of $3.1 million (or 140.3%) primarily due to the expansion of our healthcare staffing services.\nRental revenue from other Home Medical Equipment (HME) contributed an increase of $1.3 million (or 12.1%) driven by growing\ndemand for oxygen therapy, Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) therapy, and percussion vest services. Equipment and supply sales\nincreased by $0.7 million (or 9.0%) largely driven by the success of our sleep resupply program.\nPage 29\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nWhile ventilator rentals continue to make up the majority of our revenue, the growth of PAP and oxygen related sales, as well as\nour healthcare staffing offerings, is contributing to the diversity of our overall revenue mix. As we continue to expand geographically\ninto new territories and further expand our presence in our existing territories, we expect continued growth in our active ventilator\npatient base and our other respiratory offerings.\nCost of revenue and gross profit\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, cost of revenue totaled $23.6 million, an increase of $4.8 million (or 25.4%) from\nthe comparable period in 2023. Gross profit percentage decreased from approximately 61.9% in the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 to approximately 59.3% in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The change in gross profit\npercentage is primarily due to migration of the revenue mix associated with product and service diversification. Gross profit\npercentage is expected to remain relatively stable in upcoming periods due to subsiding inflationary cost pressures and the positive\neffects associated with reimbursement rates, offset by some decreases associated with product and service diversification.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue improved to 46.0% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to 47.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Selling, general and administrative\nexpenses totaled $26.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $3.0 million (or 12.8%) from the\ncomparable prior period. The improvement in selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is\nattributable to economies of scale and improvements in operational efficiencies. The overall increase in selling, general and\nadministrative expense as compared to the prior period is primarily attributable to additional employee related expenses to\naccommodate the overall growth of the Company. Employee compensation expenses increased $3.0 million (or 18.6%) as a result\nof the increase in our employee headcount and increases in market-based compensation. We expect that current year selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will remain stable through the end of 2024 due to increased\nefficiencies and costs optimization efforts relative to revenue growth.\nResearch and development\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expense totaled $0.8 million, an increase of\n$0.2 million from the comparable period in 2023. As we continue to invest in research and development related projects to support\nour technology initiatives, we expect that associated costs will remain consistent in 2024 relative to 2023 costs.\nStock-based compensation\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, stock-based compensation totaled $1.7 million, an increase of 17.8% from the\ncomparable period in 2023. We anticipate that as we expand our workforce, incorporating stock-based awards as a component of\nemployee compensation, stock-based compensation expenses will correspondingly rise. Historically, revenue growth has outpaced\nthe growth in stock-based compensation, and as a result, the percentage of stock-based compensation relative to revenue is\nexpected to decline.\nLoss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, gain on disposal of property and equipment totaled $0.5 million compared to loss\non disposal of property and equipment of $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The gain primarily resulted\nfrom proceeds related to the sale of recalled ventilators back to the manufacturer. We anticipate additional future gains from the\ndisposal of eligible devices, as the proceeds from these disposals are expected to exceed their net book value.\nIncome (expense) from investments\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, income from investments totaled $0.1 million compared to $0.3 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023. The change is primarily due to a $0.1 million impairment recognized on our debt\ninvestment, reflecting an other-than-temporary impairment in fair value during the period.\nPage 30\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nInterest expense, net\nFor both the three months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024, net interest expense totaled $0.2 million.

Management uses Adjusted EBITDA (i) to compare the Company’s operating performance on a\nconsistent basis, (ii) to calculate incentive compensation for the Company’s employees, (iii) for planning purposes, including the\npreparation of the Company’s internal annual operating budget, and (iv) to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the\nCompany’s operational strategies. Accordingly, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in\nunderstanding and evaluating the Company’s operating performance in the same manner as management. It is not a measurement\nof our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to revenue or net income, as applicable,\nor any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities\nas a measure of the Company's liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in\nisolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the\nimpact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of ongoing operations; and other companies\nin our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. In\ncalculating Adjusted EBITDA, certain items (mostly non-cash) are excluded from net income including depreciation and\namortization of capitalized assets, net interest expense (income), stock based compensation, transaction costs, impairment of\nassets, and taxes.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of Net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, on a\nhistorical basis for the periods indicated:\nSeptember 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31,\nFor the quarter ended 2024 2024 2024 2023 2023 2023 2023 2022\nNet income attributable to\nViemed Healthcare, Inc. $ 3,878 $ 1,468 $ 1,603 $ 3,477 $ 2,919 $ 2,330 $ 1,517 $ 2,438\nAdd back:\nDepreciation & amortization 6,408 6,309 6,285 5,918 5,975 5,207 4,762 4,373\nInterest expense (income) 225 254 150 256 237 (20) (49) 32\nStock-based compensation(a) 1,712 1,620 1,432 1,534 1,453 1,471 1,391 1,317\nTransaction costs(b) 12 221 110 61 177 94 206 —\nImpairment of assets(c) 125 2,173 — — — — — —\nIncome tax expense 1,594 768 518 1,599 1,320 728 501 1,146\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 13,954 $ 12,813 $ 10,098 $ 12,845 $ 12,081 $ 9,810 $ 8,328 $ 9,306\n(a) Represents non-cash, equity-based compensation expense associated with option and RSU awards.\n(b) Represents transaction costs and expenses related to acquisition and integration efforts associated with recently announced or\ncompleted acquisitions.\n(c) Represents impairments of the fair value of investment and litigation-related assets.\nPage 35\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 was $11.3 million, compared to $12.8 million at December 31, 2023. Typically,\nour principal source of liquidity is the collection of our patient accounts receivable. In addition to our collection of patient accounts\nreceivable, from time to time, we can and do obtain additional sources of liquidity by the incurrence of additional indebtedness.\nBased on our current plan of operations, we believe cash and cash equivalents, when combined with expected cash flows from\noperations and amounts available under our 2022 Senior Credit Facilities will be sufficient to fund our growth strategy and to meet\nour anticipated operating expenses, capital expenditures, and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months from the date\nof this filing. The Company has also historically utilized short term financing arrangements with suppliers that could be extended\nover a longer term if there was a need for additional liquidity.\nThe Company had historically utilized Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, to submit patient claims to certain\nnon-Medicare payors for reimbursement. UnitedHealth Group announced that on February 21, 2024, Change Healthcare’s\ninformation technology systems were impacted by a cybersecurity incident. Although this incident did not impact our day-to-day\noperations or patient care delivery, it did cause delays in submitting patient claims to certain payors. By the end of the second\nquarter of 2024, the Company had replaced Change Healthcare as its clearinghouse and resumed claims submissions using\nalternative platforms for all claims. However, the delayed claims submissions resulted in a temporary reduction of our operating\ncash flow and an increase to our accounts receivable during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet Cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 24,102 $ 31,928\nInvesting activities (21,501) (44,620)\nFinancing activities (4,093) 5,856\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,492) $ (6,836)\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $24.1 million, resulting from net\nincome of $7.0 million, increased by net income adjustments of $20.8 million and offset by an increase in non-cash working capital\nof $3.7 million. The net income adjustments primarily consisted of $19.0 million of depreciation and amortization, $4.8 million of\nstock-based compensation, a $3.5 million change in deferred tax asset, and an impairment loss on debt investment of $1.3 million.\nThe primary change in non-cash working capital was an increase in net accounts receivable of $8.2 million, partially offset by an\nincrease in accrued liabilities of $2.4 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $31.9 million, resulting from net\nincome of $6.8 million, increased by net income adjustments of $20.1 million and a change in net working capital of $5.1 million.\nThe net income adjustments primarily consisted of $15.9 million of depreciation and amortization, $4.3 million of stock-based\ncompensation, $0.8 million of distributions from equity method investments, and a $0.8 million change in deferred tax asset. The\nprimary changes in working capital were an increase in accrued liabilities of $4.1 million and a decrease in other assets of $1.2\nmillion, offset by an increase in net accounts receivable of $0.5 million.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $21.5 million. Net cash used for\ncapital expenditures during the period was $18.5 million and consisted of $25.9 million of purchases of property and equipment,\noffset by $7.4 million of sales proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment. Net cash used for capital expenditures\nrepresents a $2.5 million, or 15.4%, increase year over year. Purchases of property and equipment were primarily related to\nmedical equipment rented to our patients. Net cash used in investing activities also included $3.0 million of net cash paid for the\nacquisition of HomeMed.\nPage 36\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nNet cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $44.6 million, primarily due to the net\ncash paid for the acquisition of HMP of $28.6 million. Net cash used for capital expenditures during the period was $16.0 million\nand consisted of $18.2 million of purchases of property and equipment, offset by $2.1 million of sales proceeds from the disposal of\nproperty and equipment. Purchases of property and equipment were primarily related to medical equipment rented to our patients.\nNet Cash Provided by (used in) Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $4.1 million. For the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, proceeds from the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) were $3.0 million, which was\nused to fund the HomeMed acquisition. Subsequent to the HomeMed acquisition, principal payments on the 2022 Revolving Credit\nFacility were $5.0 million. Principal payments on the 2022 Term Loan Facility (as defined below) were $0.2 million. Additionally,\nprincipal payments on acquired loans were $0.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company\nacquired and cancelled 142,489 common shares at a cost of $1.1 million to satisfy employee income tax withholding associated\nwith RSUs vestings while proceeds from the exercise of options during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $0.4\nmillion.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $5.9 million. For the nine months\nended September 30, 2023, proceeds from the 2022 Term Loan Facility (as defined below) were $5.0 million and proceeds from\nthe 2022 Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) were $8.0 million, which were used to partially fund the cash acquisition of\nHMP. Subsequent to the acquisition of HMP, principal payments on the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility were $4.0 million.\nAdditionally, principal payments on acquired revolving and term loans were $3.8 million during the nine months ended September\n30, 2023. The Company acquired and cancelled 75,235 common shares at a cost of $0.6 million to satisfy employee income tax\nwithholding associated with RSUs vestings while proceeds from the exercise of options during the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 were $1.2 million.\nSources of Liquidity\nOur principal source of liquidity is our operating cash flow, which is supplemented by extended payment terms from our suppliers\nand amounts available under the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities.\nSenior Credit Facilities\nOn November 29, 2022, the Company refinanced its existing borrowings under the prior Commercial Business Loan Agreement\nwith Hancock Whitney Bank and entered into a new credit agreement (the \"2022 Senior Credit Facilities\") with the lenders from\ntime to time party thereto, and Regions Bank, as administrative agent and collateral agent, that provides for an up to $30.0 million\nrevolving credit facility (the \"2022 Revolving Credit Facility\") and an up to $30.0 million delayed draw term loan facility (the \"2022\nTerm Loan Facility\"), both maturing in November 2027. On May 28, 2024, the Company entered into a First Amendment to the\n2022 Senior Credit Facilities that (a) extends the delayed draw term loan commitment expiration date to November 29, 2025, from\nits initial expiration date of May 29, 2024, and (b) provides for other technical amendments.\nThe proceeds of the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility may be used to refinance existing indebtedness, for working capital purposes,\ncapital expenditures and other general corporate purposes (including permitted acquisitions), and to pay transaction fees, costs\nand expenses related to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities. The proceeds of the 2022 Term Loan Facility and any additional term\nloans established in accordance with the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities may be used to finance permitted acquisitions and to pay\ntransaction fees, costs and expenses related to such acquisitions. Outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Term Loan Facility were\n$4.7 million as of September 30, 2024. There were no outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are Term SOFR plus an applicable margin, which\nranges from 2.625% to 3.375%, or, at the option of the Company, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities) plus\nan applicable margin, which ranges from 1.625% to 2.375%.\nThe 2022 Senior Credit Facilities require the Company to comply with certain affirmative, as well as certain negative covenants\nthat, among other things, will restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur indebtedness, grant liens,\nmake investments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations and pay dividends and other restricted payments. The 2022\nSenior Credit Facilities also include certain financial covenants, which generally include, but are not limited to the following:\n• Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (defined generally as total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than (i) for\nany fiscal quarter ending during the period from the closing date to and including December 31, 2024, 2.75 to 1.0 and (ii)\nPage 37\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nfor any fiscal quarter ending on and after March 31, 2025, 2.50 to 1.0, subject to certain adjustments following a material\nacquisition.\n• Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (defined generally as (a) adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditures minus\ncash taxes to (b) the sum of scheduled principal payments plus cash interest expense plus restricted payments) of not\nless than 1.25:1.0.\nThe Company was in compliance with all covenants under the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities in effect at September 30, 2024.\nUse of Funds\nOur principal uses of cash are funding the purchase of rental assets and other capital purchases, the repayment of debt, funding of\nacquisitions, operations, and other working capital requirements. Our contractual obligations primarily relate to the repayment of\nexisting debt and contractual obligations for operating and finance leases. The following table presents our material contractual\nobligations and commitments to make future payments as of September 30, 2024:\nWithin 12 Months Beyond 12 Months\nDebt Obligations, including interest $ 1,172 $ 4,898\nLease Obligations 1,000 2,234\nTotal $ 2,172 $ 7,132\nExcept for the funding of potential acquisitions and investments, we anticipate that our operating cash flows will satisfy our material\ncash requirements for the 12 months after September 30, 2024. In addition to our operating cash flows, we may need to raise\nadditional funds to support our contractual obligations and investing activities beyond such 12 month period, and such funding may\nnot be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, our operations and\nability to execute our business strategy could be adversely affected. We may seek to raise additional funds through equity, equity-\nlinked or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness would have rights\nthat are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. Any additional equity\nfinancing may be dilutive to our stockholders.\nLeases\nLeases under which we assume substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon initial\nrecognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lesser of its fair value and the present value of the minimum\nlease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to\nthe asset. The associated lease liability is drawn down over the life of the lease by allocating a portion of each lease payment to the\nliability with the remainder being recognized as finance charges. Leases that do not transfer the risks and rewards of ownership to\nthe Company are treated as operating leases and are expensed as incurred.\nRetirement Plan\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) retirement plan for employees to which eligible employees can contribute a percentage of their\npre-tax compensation. Matching employer contributions to the 401(k) plan totaled $358,000 and $316,000 for the three months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $1,230,000 and $1,050,000 for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOff balance sheet arrangements\nThe Company has no material undisclosed off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or\nfuture effect on its results of operations or financial condition.\nPage 38\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nAccounting and Disclosure Matters\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe are required to disclose “critical accounting estimates” which are estimates made in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and that have had or are reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe follow financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States. The more significant of these policies are summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in\nPart II, Item 8 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Not all significant accounting\npolicies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments. However, the policy noted below could be deemed\nto meet the SEC’s definition of a critical accounting estimate.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are presented at net realizable values that reflect the consideration we expect to receive which is inclusive of\nadjustments for price concessions. Due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate,\ncertain estimates are required in order to record revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Management’s\nevaluation takes into consideration such factors as historical realization data, including current and historical cash collections,\naccounts receivable aging trends, other operating trends and relevant business conditions.\nInherent in these estimates is the risk that they may have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. It\nis possible that management’s estimates could change, which could have an impact on operations and cash flows. Specifically, the\ncomplexity of many third-party billing arrangements, patient qualification for medical necessity of equipment and the uncertainty of\nreimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. If the\npayment amount received differs from the estimated net realizable amount, an adjustment is made to the net realizable amount in\nthe period that these payment differences are determined.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of\nrecently issued accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of\noperations, financial positions and cash flows.\nPage 39\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOur exposure to market risk primarily relates to fluctuations in interest rates from borrowings under the 2022 Senior Credit\nFacilities. The interest rates per annum applicable to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are Term SOFR plus an applicable margin,\nwhich ranges from 2.625% to 3.375%, or, at the option of the Company, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2022 Senior Credit\nFacilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 1.625% to 2.375%. Outstanding borrowings subject to interest rate\nfluctuations under the 2022 Term Loan Facility were $4.7 million as of September 30, 2024. There were no outstanding borrowings\nunder the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. Based on our outstanding borrowings, an immediate 100 basis\npoint change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our net income.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to\nRule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded:\ni. that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure (a) that information required to be\ndisclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized\nand reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and (b) that such information is accumulated\nand communicated to the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as\nappropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and\nii. that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that the Company's disclosures controls and procedures will detect or\nuncover all failures of persons within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries to disclose material information otherwise\nrequired to be set forth in the Company's periodic reports. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of\ndisclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and\nprocedures.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September\n30, 2024 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial\nreporting.\nPage 40\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to various ongoing or threatened legal actions and other proceedings, including those that\narise in the ordinary course of business, which may include employment matters, breach of contract disputes, as well as\ngovernmental and regulatory matters. Please read Note 9—Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information. Such matters are\nsubject to many uncertainties and to outcomes that are not predictable with assurance and that may not be known for extended\nperiods of time.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors\ndiscussed in “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March\n6, 2024, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Except as set forth below, there have been\nno material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in that Annual Report.\nWe will no longer qualify as an “emerging growth company” as of December 31, 2024 and, as a result, we will no longer\nbe able to avail ourselves of certain reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, subject to\ncertain grace periods.\nWe are currently an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we have taken advantage of certain exemptions\nfrom various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies,”\nincluding not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions\nfrom the requirements of holding advisory “say-on-pay” votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on\ngolden parachute compensation. In addition, as an emerging growth company, we have elected to use the extended transition\nperiod for complying with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\nAs a result, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to\ncomply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies.\nWe will no longer qualify as an “emerging growth company” as of December 31, 2024, which the last day of the fiscal year following\nthe fifth anniversary of our first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities\nAct. As a result, subject to certain grace periods, we will be required to:\n• engage an independent registered public accounting firm to provide an attestation report on our internal control over\nfinancial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n• submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes; and\n• disclose a compensation discussion and analysis, including disclosure regarding certain executive compensation related\nitems such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive\nofficer’s compensation to median employee compensation.\nWe will no longer able to take advantage of cost savings associated with the JOBS Act. Furthermore, if the additional requirements\napplicable to non-emerging growth companies divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business\nconcerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The increased\ncosts will decrease our net income or increase our net loss and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business. We\ncannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. Furthermore, if\nwe are unable to satisfy our obligations as a non-emerging growth company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock,\nfines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nAs a result of our loss of “emerging growth company” status, it is possible that investors will find our common stock less attractive\nin light of the fact that we have relied on certain of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a\nresult, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our share price may be more volatile. In addition, any\nfailure to comply with these additional requirements in a timely manner, or at all, could have an adverse effect on our business and\nresults of operations and could cause a decline in the price of our common stock.\nPage 41\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nNone.\nCompany Repurchases of Equity Securities\nNone.\nDividends\nWe have not declared or paid any cash or stock dividends on our common shares since our inception. Any future determination as\nto the declaration and payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend on then-existing conditions,\nincluding our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and other\nfactors that the Board considers relevant. Our subsidiaries are restricted from making distributions or dividend payments to us by\nthe 2022 Senior Credit Facilities (as defined above), subject to certain exceptions.

Nature of Business and Operations\nViemed Healthcare, Inc. (the \"Company\"), through its subsidiaries, is a provider of home medical equipment (\"HME\") and post-\nacute respiratory healthcare services in the United States. The Company’s service offerings are focused on effective in-home\ntreatment with clinical practitioners providing therapy and counseling to patients in their homes using cutting edge technology. The\nCompany serves patients in all 50 states of the United States. The Company was incorporated under the Business Corporations\nAct (British Columbia) on December 14, 2016. The Company's registered and records office is located at Suite 2800, Park Place,\n666 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia V6C 2Z7 and its corporate office is located at 625 E. Kaliste Saloom Road,\nLafayette, Louisiana 70508.\nThe Company is an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \"JOBS Act\"), and as\nsuch, has elected to comply with certain reduced U.S. public company reporting requirements.\nThe Company’s common shares are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \"VMD\".\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and\nfootnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements\nare unaudited, but reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals, which, in the opinion of management, are\nnecessary to present fairly the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nIncome, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity and Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nCash Flows for the interim periods presented. The Company's fiscal year ends on December 31. The Condensed Consolidated\nBalance Sheet as of December 31, 2023 was derived from audited consolidated financial statements but does not include all\ndisclosures required by GAAP. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual\nconsolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the report of the Company's independent registered public accounting\nfirm included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The nature of the Company's\nbusiness is such that the results of any interim period may not be indicative of the results to be expected for the entire year.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries in which it has a controlling\nfinancial interest. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date\nof the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiod. Management bases these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience, existing and known circumstances,\nauthoritative accounting pronouncements and other factors that management believes to be reasonable. Significant areas requiring\nthe use of management estimates relate to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, income tax provisions, the fair value of\nfinancial instruments, and goodwill. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nPage 7\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company’s chief operating decision-makers (\"CODMs\") are its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, who make\nresource allocation decisions and assess performance based on financial information presented on an aggregate basis. There are\nno segment managers who are held accountable by the chief operating decision-makers, or anyone else, for any planning, strategy\nand key decision-making regarding operations. The corporate office is responsible for contract negotiation with vendors and\npayors, corporate compliance with healthcare laws and regulations, and revenue cycle management, among other corporate\nsupporting functions. Accordingly, the Company has a single reportable segment and operating segment structure based on ASC\n280, Segment Reporting.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable and net revenues are based on contractually agreed-upon rates for services provided, reduced by estimated\nadjustments, including variable consideration for implicit price concessions for sales revenue. Inherent in these estimates is the risk\nthat they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. The complexity of third-party billing\narrangements and laws and regulations governing Medicare and Medicaid may result in adjustments to amounts originally\nrecorded.\nThe Company performs a periodic analysis to review the valuation of accounts receivable and collectability of outstanding\nbalances. These estimates are determined utilizing historical realization data under a portfolio approach, which is then assessed by\nmanagement to evaluate whether adjustments should be made based on accounts receivable aging trends, other operating trends,\nand relevant business conditions such as governmental and managed care payor claims processing procedures.\nThe Company records a reserve for estimated probable losses as part of net rental revenue adjustments in order to report rental\nrevenue at an expected collectable amount based on the total portfolio of operating lease receivables for which collectability has\nbeen deemed probable. The accounts receivable are presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets net of the\nadjustments.\nReceivables are considered past due when not collected by established due dates. Specific patient balances are written off after\ncollection efforts have been followed and the account has been determined to be uncollectible. Revisions in reserve estimates are\nrecorded as an adjustment to net revenue in the period of revision. The estimates of the allowance for uncollectible accounts was\n$15.9 million and $11.1 million as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nIncluded in accounts receivable at June 30, 2024 are amounts due from Medicare and Medicaid representing 25% and 2%,\nrespectively, and 27% combined, of total outstanding net receivables. As of December 31, 2023, 32% of total outstanding net\nreceivables were amounts due from Medicare and Medicaid.\nInventory\nInventory represents non-serialized supplies that consist of equipment parts, consumables, and associated product supplies and is\nexpensed at the time of sale or use. The Company values inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Obsolete and\nunserviceable inventories are valued at estimated net realizable value.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at historic cost less accumulated\ndepreciation. Major renewals and improvements that extend the useful life of assets are capitalized to the respective property\naccounts, while maintenance and repairs, which do not extend the useful life of the respective assets, are expensed as incurred.\nManagement has estimated the useful lives of equipment leased to customers. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis\nover their estimated useful lives.\nDepreciation of medical equipment commences at the date of service, which represents the date that the asset has been delivered\nto a patient and is put in use and continues through the useful life of the asset. Property and equipment with definite useful lives are\ntested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nPage 8\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\nEquity Investments\nEquity investments on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are comprised of an investment accounted for under the\nequity method and equity investments without readily determinable fair values accounted for under the measurement alternative\ndescribed in ASC 321-10-35-2.\nThe following table details the Company’s equity investments:\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nEquity method investments $ 434 $ 320\nOther equity investments 1,360 1,360\nBalance, end of period $ 1,794 $ 1,680\nInvestments accounted for under the equity method are investments in unconsolidated entities over whose operating and financial\npolicies the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence but not control. Equity method investments are initially\nmeasured at cost in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with any subsequent adjustments made to the carrying amount\nof the investment for the Company’s proportionate share of income or loss. Distributions received from the investee reduce the\nCompany’s carrying value of the investment. The Company has recognized its share of income or loss on the gain (loss) from\nequity method investments within non-operating expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Equity method\ninvestments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the\ninvestments may exceed the fair value. No events or changes have occurred as of June 30, 2024 that would impair the carrying\nvalue of equity method investments.\nOther equity investments are investments without a readily determinable fair value which do not qualify for the practical expedient\nin ASC 820. For these investments, the Company has elected the measurement alternative which measures the investment at cost,\nless any impairment. ASU 2019-04 clarifies that if an entity identifies observable price changes in orderly transactions for the\nidentical or a similar investment of the same issuer, it must measure its equity investment at fair value in accordance with ASC 820\nas of the date that the observable transaction occurred. The Company was not aware of any impairment or observable price\nchange adjustments that needed to be made as of June 30, 2024 on its investments in equity securities without a readily\ndeterminable fair value.\nDebt Investment\nThe Company's debt investment is a variable rate secured convertible note and is classified as an available-for-sale debt\ninstrument. Accrued interest is included in the amortized cost basis at each reporting period. At each financial statement date until\na conversion event, the debt instrument is required to be remeasured at fair value. Changes in unrealized gains and losses are\naccounted for in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax effect, until realized. When changes are determined to be\nother than temporary in nature, the Company recognizes an other than temporary impairment expense in earnings equal to the\ndifference between the debt security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets include trade names and other identifiable intangible assets, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over a\nperiod of their expected useful lives, generally five years.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are principally derived from the rental and sale of HME products and services to patients.\nRental revenues\nRevenue generated from equipment that is rented to patients is recognized over the non-cancellable rental period (typically one\nmonth) and commences on delivery of the equipment to the patients. The agreements are evaluated at commencement and the\nstart of each monthly renewal period to determine if it is reasonably certain that the monthly renewal or purchase options would be\nexercised. The exercise of monthly renewal or purchase options by a patient has historically not been reasonably certain to occur\nat lease commencement or subsequent monthly renewal.\nPage 9\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\nRevenues are recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with payors, including private\ninsurers, prepaid health plans, Medicare, Medicaid and patients. Rental revenue, less estimated adjustments, is recognized as\nearned on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable lease term. Rental of patient equipment is billed on a monthly basis\nbeginning on the date the equipment is delivered. Since deliveries can occur on any day during a month, the amount of billings that\napply to the next month are deferred.\nThe Company's lease agreements generally contain lease components and non-lease components, which primarily relate to\nsupplies. The Company has made the accounting policy election to account for a lease component of an agreement and its\nassociated non-lease components as a single lease component based on the Company's assessment of classification of the lease\nbased on the consideration in the contract for the combined component.\nSales and Services revenues\nRevenue related to sales of equipment and supplies is recognized on the date of delivery as this is when control of the promised\ngoods is transferred to patients and is presented net of applicable sales taxes. Revenues are recorded only to the extent it is\nprobable that a significant reversal will not occur in the future as amounts may include implicit price concessions under\nreimbursement arrangements with payors, including private insurers, prepaid health plans, Medicare, Medicaid and patients. The\nsales transaction price is determined based on contractually agreed-upon rates, adjusted for estimates of variable consideration.\nThe expected value method is used in determining the variable consideration as part of determining the sales transaction price\nusing historical reimbursement experience, historical sales returns, and other operating trends. Payment terms and conditions vary\nby contract. The timing of revenue recognition, billing, and cash collection generally results in billed and unbilled accounts\nreceivable.\nRevenues associated with external staffing services are accrued on an hourly basis and are recorded based on the determination\nof whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent. In arrangements in which the Company manages customers'\nsupplemental workforce needs utilizing its own network of healthcare professionals, the Company is determined to be a principal\nand includes the contractual gross billings in revenues with a corresponding increase to cost of revenues for worksite employee\npayroll costs associated with these services. Alternatively, when the Company acts as agent in the performance of workforce\nmanagement, revenue is recorded based on contractually agreed upon fees or commissions with no associated cost of revenues.\nThe revenues from each major source are summarized in the following table:\nThree Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue from rentals\nVentilator rentals, non-invasive and invasive $ 30,445 $ 25,712 $ 59,632 $ 50,859\nOther home medical equipment rentals 12,211 8,419 23,145 15,325\nRevenue from sales and services\nEquipment and supply sales 7,378 6,778 13,516 11,542\nService revenues 4,931 2,402 9,265 5,141\nTotal revenues $ 54,965 $ 43,311 $ 105,558 $ 82,867\nRevenues from Medicare as percentages of the Company's total revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were\n43% and 45%, respectively.\nPage 10\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, \"Compensation—Stock Compensation\",\nwhich establishes accounting for share-based awards exchanged for employee services and requires companies to expense the\nestimated fair value of these awards over the requisite employee service period. Stock–based compensation costs for stock\noptions are determined at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Stock-based compensation costs for\nrestricted stock units (\"RSUs\") are determined at the grant date based on the closing stock price. The expense of such stock-based\ncompensation awards is recognized using the graded vesting attribution method over the vesting period and the offsetting credit is\nrecorded as an increase in additional paid-in capital. Forfeitures are recorded as incurred. Any excess tax benefit or deficiency is\nrecognized as a component of income taxes and within operating cash flows upon vesting of the share-based award.\nFor the Company’s phantom share units settled in cash, the Company computes the fair value of the phantom share units using the\nclosing price of the Company's stock at the end of each period and records a liability based on the percentage of requisite service.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in numerous U.S. jurisdictions. The Company's income tax provisions reflect\nmanagement’s interpretation of country and state tax laws. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax\ndetermination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business and may remain uncertain for several years after their\noccurrence. The Company recognizes assets and liabilities for taxation when it is probable that the Company will receive refunds\nfrom or pay taxes to the relevant tax authority. Where the final determination of tax assets and liabilities is different from the\namounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income taxes provision in the period in\nwhich such a determination is made. Changes in tax law or changes in the way tax law is interpreted may also impact the\nCompany's effective tax rate as well as the Company's business and operations.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future income tax consequences attributable to temporary\ndifferences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases. Deferred\nincome tax assets or liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in\nwhich those temporary differences are expected to be settled. The calculation of current and deferred income taxes requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions and to exercise a certain amount of judgment concerning the carrying value of\nassets and liabilities. The current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are also impacted by expectations about future\noperating results and the timing of reversal of temporary differences as well as possible audits of tax filings by regulatory agencies.\nChanges or differences in these estimates or assumptions may result in changes to the current and deferred tax assets and\nliabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and a charge to or recovery of income tax expense.\nDeferred tax is recognized on any temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated\nfinancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable earnings. The effect of a change in the\nenacted tax rates is recognized in net earnings and comprehensive income or in equity depending on the item to which the\nadjustment relates. At each reporting period end, deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability based on whether it is more\nlikely than not that sufficient taxable earnings will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business acquisitions. The results of operations of the business\nacquired by the Company are included as of the respective acquisition date. The acquisition-date fair value of the consideration\ntransferred, including the fair value of any contingent consideration, is allocated to the underlying assets acquired, liabilities\nassumed, and noncontrolling interest in the acquiree based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. To the extent\nthe acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred exceeds the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible\nassets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests, such excess is allocated to goodwill. Patient relationships,\nmedical records and patient lists are not reported as separate intangible assets due to the regulatory requirements and lack of\ncontractual agreements but are part of goodwill. Customer related relationships are not reported as separate intangible assets but\nare part of goodwill as authorizing physicians are under no obligation to refer the Company’s services to their patients, who are free\nto change physicians and service providers at any time. The Company may adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as\nnecessary, as it obtains more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed that existed but were not available at\nthe acquisition date, which is generally up to one year after the acquisition closing date. Acquisition related costs are recognized\nseparately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nPage 11\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\nImpairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill resulting from business combinations is not amortized, rather, it is assessed for impairment annually and upon the\noccurrence of a triggering event or change in circumstances indicating a possible impairment. Such triggering events potentially\nwarranting an annual or interim goodwill impairment assessment include, among other factors, declines in historical or projected\nrevenue, operating income or cash flows, and sustained decreases in the Company’s stock price or market capitalization. Such\nchanges in circumstance can include, among others, changes in the legal environment, reimbursement environment, operating\nperformance, and/or future prospects.\nThe Company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year. The impairment\nassessment can be performed on either a quantitative or qualitative basis. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to\ndetermine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. If determined necessary, the Company\napplies the quantitative impairment test to identify and measure the amount of impairment, if any. Fair value determinations require\nconsiderable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors, such as estimates of a reporting unit's\nfair value and judgment about impairment triggering events. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and\nassumptions made for purposes of the annual or interim goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company performed an assessment of qualitative factors and determined that no\nevents or circumstances existed that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived\nassets were less than the carrying amount. As such, a quantitative analysis was not required to be performed and the Company did\nnot record any goodwill impairment charges.\nThe Company follows ASC Topic 360, which requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the asset group’s carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In performing the review for\nrecoverability, if future undiscounted cash flows (excluding interest charges) from the use and ultimate disposition of the assets are\nless than their carrying values, an impairment loss represented by the difference between its fair value and carrying value, is\nrecognized. When properties are classified as held for sale, they are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or the expected\nsales price less costs to sell.\nThere were no impairment charges to goodwill or long-lived assets recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and\nJune 30, 2023.\nNet Income per Share Attributable to Viemed Healthcare, Inc.'s Common Stockholders\nBasic net income per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during\nthe period. Diluted net income per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the\neffect of dilutive stock-based awards outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive stock-based awards\ninclude outstanding common stock options and time-based RSUs.\nSee Note 11 for earnings per share computations.\nPage 12\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, Liabilities — Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of\nSupplier Finance Program Obligations, which requires entities that use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase\nof goods and services to disclose the key terms of the programs and information about their obligations that are outstanding at the\nend of the reporting period. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022,\nincluding interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company adopted this standard during the year ended December 31, 2023, which\ndid not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company” as defined by the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth\ncompany can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can selectively\ndelay the adoption of all accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company\nhas elected to utilize this exemption and, as a result, the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements may not be\ncomparable to the financial statements of issuers that are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting\nstandards that are applicable to public companies. To date, however, the Company has not delayed the adoption of any accounting\nstandards. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that the Company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period at any\ntime, which election is irrevocable.\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-09,\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which is intended to improve the transparency of income tax\ndisclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the effective tax rate reconciliation and\nincome taxes paid by jurisdiction. The ASU is effective for public business entities' annual periods beginning after December 15,\n2024, with early adoption permitted.

As a result of the\nacquisition, goodwill of $3.2 million and a trade name of $0.4 million were recognized. The Company expects its portion of the\ngoodwill to be fully tax-deductible. Additionally, a noncontrolling interest of $1.8 million was recorded at the acquisition date. The\naccompanying financial statements include the results of HomeMed's operations from the acquisition date. Changes in the\nnoncontrolling interests after the acquisition date are accounted for pursuant to ASC 810, Consolidation.\nHome Medical Products, Inc.\nOn June 1, 2023, Viemed, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the acquisition of Home Medical Products,\nInc., (“HMP”), which operates in Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi.

Upon the initial draw of debt under the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities during the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, the Company reclassified the deferred financing fees previously recorded in other long-term\nassets to long-term debt in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nOn May 28, 2024, the Company entered into a First Amendment to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities that (a) extends the delayed\ndraw term loan commitment expiration date to November 29, 2025, from its initial expiration date of May 29, 2024, and (b) provides\nfor other technical amendments. Payment for debt issuance costs associated with the amendment was $0.2 million during the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024.\nMedical Equipment Financing\nThe Company enters into medical equipment financing obligations through supplier finance programs. The financing obligations\nare primarily short term in nature and are payable in monthly installments. As of June 30, 2024, $0.4 million of the outstanding\nmedical equipment financing is presented on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as short term debt based on the\nscheduled repayment dates.\nLeases\nThe Company has recognized finance lease liabilities for vehicles and operating leases for land and buildings that have terms\ngreater than twelve months, as follows:\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nLease liabilities $ 2,981 $ 3,250\nLess:\nCurrent portion of lease liabilities (848) (934)\nNet long-term lease liabilities $ 2,133 $ 2,316\nOperating Lease Liabilities\nThe Company has recognized operating lease liabilities that relate primarily to the lease of land and buildings. The exercise of\nlease renewal options is at the Company's sole discretion and is included in the lease term for calculations of its right-of-use assets\nand liabilities when it is reasonably certain that the Company plans to renew these leases. These lease liabilities are recorded at\npresent value based on a discount rate of 5.5%, which was based on the Company's incremental borrowing rate at the time of\nassessment. At June 30, 2024, the weighted average lease term was approximately 3.88 years.\nFuture maturities of the Company's operating lease liabilities as of June 30, 2024 are summarized as follows:\nLease Liability\n2024 $ 448\n2025 876\n2026 756\n2027 661\n2028 573\nThereafter 7\nTotal lease payments $ 3,321\nLess: imputed interest 479\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 2,842\nOperating rental expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024 amounted to $0.7 million.\nPage 17\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\n7. Fair Value Measurement\nUnder ASC Topic 820, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (i.e., an exit price). ASC Topic 820 establishes a\nhierarchy for inputs to valuation techniques used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and\nminimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. There are three\nlevels to the hierarchy based on the reliability of inputs, as follows:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or\nsimilar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value\nis greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3.\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe Company measures certain assets at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no transfers between fair value measurement\nlevels during any presented period.\nThe following tables summarize the Company's assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023:\nAt June 30, 2024\n(In thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements:\nMoney market mutual funds $ 20 $ — $ — $ 20\nAvailable for sale debt instrument — — 1,000 1,000\nTotal $ 20 $ — $ 1,000 $ 1,020\nAt December 31, 2023\n(In thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements:\nMoney market mutual funds $ 5,657 $ — $ — $ 5,657\nAvailable for sale debt instrument $ — $ — $ 2,219 $ 2,219\nTotal $ 5,657 $ — $ 2,219 $ 7,876\nAvailable for Sale Debt Instrument\nThe fair value of the Company’s available for sale debt instrument is classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the\nCompany evaluates adjustments using a combination of observable and unobservable inputs, such as operating results of the\ncounterparty as well observable prices in transactions of debt and equity instruments of the issuing counterparty when available. As\nof June 30, 2024, the analysis resulted in the determination that the decline in fair value was an other than temporary impairment\n(OTTI). Accordingly, the Company recognized an OTTI loss of $1.3 million in Income (expense) from investments during the\nquarter ended June 30, 2024. The recognized loss is equal to the difference between the debt security’s amortized cost basis and\nits fair value at the balance sheet date, based on management's estimate of fair value.\nPage 18\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nThe Company measures certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets include equity method investments,\nother equity investments, and the fair value allocation related to the Company’s acquisitions.\nEquity method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\nvalue of the investments may exceed the fair value. The Company's other equity investments are holdings in privately-held\ncompanies without a readily determinable market value. The Company remeasures equity securities without readily determinable\nfair value at fair value when an orderly transaction is identified for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer in\naccordance with the measurement alternative under Topic 820. ASU 2019-04 states that the measurement alternative is a\nnonrecurring fair value measurement. Accordingly, other equity investments without readily determinable fair value are classified\nwithin Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because the Company estimates the value using a combination of observable and\nunobservable inputs, including valuation ascribed to the issuing company in subsequent financing rounds, volatility in the results of\noperations of the issuers and rights and obligations of the holdings the Company owns. The Company had no material adjustments\nof equity method investments or other equity investments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during any of the periods\npresented.\nThe fair value allocation related to the Company’s acquisitions are determined using a discounted cash flow approach, or a\nreplacement cost approach, which are based on significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). These valuation methods required\nmanagement to make various assumptions, including, but not limited to, future profitability, cash flows, replacement costs, and\ndiscount rates. The Company’s estimates are based upon historical trends, management’s knowledge and experience and overall\neconomic factors, including projections of future earnings potential. Developing discounted future cash flows in applying the income\napproach requires the Company to evaluate its intermediate to longer-term strategies, including, but not limited to, estimates of\nrevenue growth, operating margins, capital requirements, inflation and working capital management. The development of\nappropriate rates to discount the estimated future cash flows requires the selection of risk premiums, which can materially impact\nthe present value of future cash flows.\nThe Company estimated the fair value of acquired identifiable intangible assets using discounted cash flow techniques that\nincluded an estimate of future cash flows, consistent with overall cash flow projections used to determine the purchase price paid to\nacquire the business, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows. The Company estimated the fair\nvalue of certain acquired identifiable intangible assets based on the cost approach using estimated costs consistent with historical\nexperience. The Company believes the estimates and assumptions used in the valuation methods are reasonable.\nThere were no transfers between fair value measurement levels during any presented period.\nPage 19\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\n8. Shareholders' Equity\nAuthorized Share Capital\nThe Company’s authorized share capital consists of an unlimited number of common shares, with no stated par value.\nIssued and Outstanding Share Capital\nThe Company has only one class of stock outstanding, common shares. The authorized stock consists of an unlimited number of\ncommon shares with no stated par value, of which 38,825,799 and 38,506,161 shares were issued and outstanding as of June 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe Company acquired and cancelled 129,983 common shares at a cost of $1.0 million to satisfy employee income tax withholding\nassociated with RSUs vesting during the six months ended June 30, 2024. The Company’s retained earnings were reduced by the\namount paid for the shares repurchased and cancelled.\nStock-Based Compensation\nOn June 6, 2024 (the \"Effective Date\"), the Company’s shareholders approved the Company's 2024 Long Term Incentive Plan (the\n\"2024 Omnibus Plan\") to provide an incentive to attract, retain, and reward directors, officers, employees, and consultants who\nprovide services to the Company or any of its subsidiaries. All directors, officers, employees, and consultants of the Company and/\nor its affiliates are eligible to receive awards under the 2024 Omnibus Plan, subject to its terms. Awards include common share\npurchase options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, performance awards, or other stock-based awards, including restricted\nstock units, deferred stock units, and dividends and dividend equivalents. The maximum number of common shares that will be\navailable for awards and issuance under the 2024 Omnibus Plan and that may be reserved for issuance at any time, including\nunder previous plans such as the 2020 Long Term Incentive Plan (effective June 11, 2020), the Amended and Restated Stock\nOption Plan (effective as of July 17, 2018), the Amended and Restated Restricted Share Unit Plan (effective as of July 17, 2018),\nand the Deferred Share Unit Plan (effective July 17, 2018), will be 7,800,000 shares. The maximum amount of common shares that\nmay be awarded under the 2024 Omnibus Plan as “incentive stock options” is 1,000,000 common shares. As of June 30, 2024, the\nCompany had outstanding options of 4,143,000 and RSUs of 1,538,000 associated with common shares under the existing plans.\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\n(in thousands):\nThree Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nStock-based compensation - options $ 59 $ 301 $ 170 $ 649\nStock-based compensation - restricted stock units 1,561 1,170 2,882 2,213\nTotal $ 1,620 $ 1,471 $ 3,052 $ 2,862\nAt June 30, 2024, there was approximately $147,000 of total unrecognized pre-tax stock option expense under the Company's\nequity compensation plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.67 years. As of June 30, 2024,\nthere was approximately $6,782,000 of total unrecognized pre-tax compensation expense related to outstanding time-based\nrestricted stock units that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.57 years.\nPage 20\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\nOptions\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the six months ended June 30, 2024:\nNumber of Weighted average\noptions Weighted average remaining Aggregate\n(000's) exercise price(1) contractual life intrinsic value(2)\nBalance December 31, 2023 4,214 $ 5.25 5.9 years $ 11,698\nIssued — —\nExercised (64) 5.07\nExpired / Forfeited (7) 5.21\nBalance June 30, 2024 4,143 $ 5.25 5.4 years $ 7,198\n(1)For presentation purposes, stock options issued with a Canadian dollar exercise price have been translated to U.S. dollars based on the\nprevailing exchange rate on the date of grant.\n(2)The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding represents the difference between the exercise price of the option and the closing price of the\nCompany's common shares on the last trading day of the period ($6.55 and $7.85 on June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively).\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding was $7,198,163 and options exercisable was $6,888,789 at June 30, 2024.\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, 64,130 common shares were issued pursuant to the exercise of stock options.\nAt June 30, 2024, the Company had 3,874,000 exercisable stock options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of\n$5.24 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.2 years. At December 31, 2023, the Company had 3,461,000\nexercisable stock options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $4.99 and a weighted average remaining\ncontractual life of 5.5 years.\nThe fair value of the stock options has been charged to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and credited to\nadditional paid-in capital over the vesting period, using the grant date fair value based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nThe assumptions used to determine the grant date fair value of stock options include exercise price, risk-free interest rates,\nexpected volatility, and average life of an option. The risk-free interest rates are based on the rates available at the time of the grant\nfor zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the option’s expected life. The average life of an option is\nbased on both historical and projected exercise and lapsing data. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded\noptions on the Company's common shares and historical volatility of the Company's common shares over the expected life of the\noption. There were no issuances of options during the six months ended June 30, 2024.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe Company accounts for RSUs using fair value. The fair value of the RSUs has been charged to the Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Income and credited to additional paid-in capital over the vesting period, based on the stock price on the date of\ngrant. RSUs vest generally over a one or three-year period. The Company accounts for forfeitures of RSUs under ASU 2016-09\nand recognizes forfeitures in the period in which they occur.\nThe following table summarizes RSU activity for the six months ended June 30, 2024:\nWeighted\nWeighted average Aggregate\nNumber of average grant remaining intrinsic\nRSUs (000's) price contractual life value(1)\nBalance December 31, 2023 1,226 $ 7.23 0.86 years $ 9,624\nIssued 798 8.31\nVested (385) 6.90\nForfeited (101) 7.89\nBalance June 30, 2024 1,538 $ 7.83 1.57 years $ 10,074\n(1)The aggregate intrinsic value of time-based RSUs outstanding was based on the closing price of the Company's common shares on the last\ntrading day of the period ($6.55 and $7.85 on June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively).\nPage 21\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company issued 47,726 RSUs with equal annual vestings over a three year\nperiod and a fair value of $0.3 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company issued 798,000 RSUs with equal\nannual vestings over a three year period and a fair value of $6.4 million.\nPhantom Share Units\nThe Company has a phantom share unit plan, which it uses for grants to directors, officers, and employees. Phantom share units\ngranted under the plan are non-assignable and are settled in cash at vesting based on the fair value of the Company's common\nstock on the vesting date. Phantom share units vest annually over a three-year period. The cash-settled phantom share units are\naccounted for as liability awards and are re-measured at fair value each reporting period until they become vested with accrued\nliability and related expense being recognized over the requisite service period.\nThe following table summarizes phantom share unit activity for the six months ended June 30, 2024:\nNumber of phantom Value of share\nshare units (000's) equivalents(1)\nBalance December 31, 2023 418 $ 3,281\nIssued 266 2,146\nVested (210) 1,550\nForfeited (14) (94)\nBalance June 30, 2024 460 $ 3,013\n(1)The value of outstanding share equivalents at the beginning of the period is based on the market price of the Company’s common shares at that\ntime, the value of issued share equivalents is based on the market price of the Company’s common shares at issuance, the value of vested share\nequivalents is based on the cash paid at the time of vesting, and the values of forfeited share equivalents and outstanding share equivalents at the\nend of the period are based on the market price of the Company's common shares at the end of the period. The market price of the Company's\ncommon shares was $6.55 and $7.85 on June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe change in fair value of the phantom share units has been charged to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and\nrecorded as a liability included in accrued liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities. The total liability associated with phantom\nshare units at June 30, 2024 is $1,427,000, with $986,000 of this amount included in current accrued liabilities and the remaining\nportion of $441,000 included in long-term accrued liabilities.\nThe impact associated with the fair value re-measurement of phantom share units is recorded in selling, general and administrative\nexpenses within the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company accrues estimates for resolution of any legal and other contingencies when losses are probable and reasonably\nestimable in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies (“ASC 450”). No less than quarterly, the Company reviews the status of\neach significant matter underlying a legal proceeding or claim and assess our potential financial exposure. The Company accrues a\nliability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any legal proceeding or claim is considered probable and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether\nthe amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable, and accruals are based only on the information available to the Company at\nthe time the judgment is made, which may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate or unanticipated events and circumstances may\noccur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, the outcome of legal proceedings is\ninherently uncertain, and we may incur substantial defense costs and expenses defending any of these matters.\nLegal Proceedings\nAs previously disclosed, the Company (through its subsidiary Sleep Management LLC) submitted a purchase order (the “Purchase\nOrder”) in March 2020 to Vyaire Medical, Inc. d/b/a CareFusion Respiratory Technologies (“Vyaire”) for respiratory equipment. The\nCompany ultimately prepaid $1.4 million towards the delivery of such respiratory equipment. Vyaire was unable or unwilling to\ndeliver the vast majority of the respiratory equipment referenced in the Purchase Order, and also refused to refund the prepayment\namount (less the amounts paid for equipment actually received). On November 5, 2020, the Company (through its subsidiary Sleep\nManagement LLC) filed a lawsuit against Vyaire in the 15th Judicial District Court for the Parish of Lafayette, Louisiana (the “State\nCourt”) seeking damages for breach of contract and seeking a declaratory judgment that the Company is not required to pay any\nfurther funds to Vyaire. Vyaire filed a Reconventional Demand with the State Court alleging breach of contract and seeking\ndamages of $4.7 million purportedly for the improper cancellation of the Purchase Order. The State Court issued an order on\nSeptember 5, 2023 granting the Company Partial Summary Judgment finding that Vyaire breached the contract. However, on June\n9, 2024, Vyaire and certain of its affiliates filed voluntary bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the US\nBankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.\nThe Company continues to believe that it has valid legal and equitable claims to recover its outstanding prepayment as a result of\nVyaire’s failure to deliver the vast majority of the respiratory equipment referenced in the Purchase Order. However, as a result of\nthe bankruptcy filing, collection of the outstanding prepaid amounts is no longer determined to be probable. During the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2024, outstanding funds receivable in the amount of $0.9 million related to undelivered respiratory\nequipment were impaired through Other expense (income).\nGovernmental and Regulatory Matters\nFrom time to time the Company is involved in various external governmental investigations, audits and reviews. Reviews, audits\nand investigations of this sort can lead to government actions, which can result in the assessment of recoupment of\nreimbursement, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way the Company\nconducts business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs.\n10. Income Taxes\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded income tax expense of $1.3 million, which includes a discrete tax\nbenefit of $0.1 million associated with stock-based compensation arrangements. Excluding the impact of the discrete taxes, the\neffective rate for the six months ended June 30, 2024 is 30.9%. The effective rate differs from the amount computed by applying\nthe statutory federal and state income tax rates to ordinary income before the provision for income taxes due to permanent non-\ndeductible differences. The Company's effective tax rate is based on forecasted annual results which may fluctuate significantly\nthrough the rest of the year.\nAt June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no amounts recorded for uncertain tax positions and does not expect any material\nchanges in uncertain tax benefits during the next 12 months. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax\nmatters in income tax expense. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in various states. The\nCompany is generally not subject to examination by taxing authorities for years prior to 2020.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that the Company believes that these assets are more likely than not to\nbe realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future\nreversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent\noperations.\nPage 23\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\n11. Earnings Per Share\nIncome per common share is calculated using earnings for the year divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding\nduring the year. Using the treasury stock method, diluted income per share amounts are calculated giving effect to the potential\ndilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to issue common shares were exercised or converted to common shares by\nassuming the proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs are used to purchase common shares\nat the prevailing market rate.\nThe following reflects the earnings and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:\nThree Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator - basic and diluted:\nNet income attributable to Viemed Healthcare, Inc. $ 1,468 $ 2,330 $ 3,071 $ 3,847\nDenominator:\nBasic weighted-average number of common shares 38,822,980 38,324,249 38,558,479 38,240,902\nDiluted weighted-average number of shares 40,553,449 40,676,951 40,313,042 40,383,616\nBasic earnings per share $ 0.04 $ 0.06 $ 0.08 $ 0.10\nDiluted earnings per share $ 0.04 $ 0.06 $ 0.08 $ 0.10\nDenominator calculation from basic to diluted:\nBasic weighted-average number of common shares 38,822,980 38,324,249 38,558,479 38,240,902\nStock options and other dilutive securities 1,730,469 2,352,702 1,754,563 2,142,714\nDiluted weighted-average number of shares 40,553,449 40,676,951 40,313,042 40,383,616\nAnti-dilutive shares excluded from the calculation consisted of dilutive employee stock options and RSUs that were de minimis in all\nperiods presented.\n12.

Some of the\ninformation in this discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Actual results\nand timing of events could differ from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the\nfollowing discussion and analysis.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements and information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the\nmeaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or \"forward-looking information\" as such term is defined in\napplicable Canadian securities legislation (collectively, \"forward-looking statements\"). Any statements other than statements of\nhistorical information, including those that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives,\nassumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking and may involve estimates,\nassumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-\nlooking statements. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly\nupdate or revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events\nor otherwise, except as required by applicable law.\nForward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance and reflect the expectations or beliefs of management\nregarding future events, and include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: operating results; profitability; financial\ncondition and resources; anticipated needs for working capital; liquidity; capital resources; capital expenditures; milestones;\nlicensing milestones; information with respect to future growth and growth strategies; anticipated trends in our industry; our future\nfinancing plans; timelines; currency fluctuations; government regulation; unanticipated expenses; commercial disputes or claims;\nlimitations on insurance coverage or other reimbursement; and availability of cash flow to fund capital requirements.\nOften, but not always, forward-looking information can be identified by the use of words such as “plans”, “expects”, “is expected”,\n“budget”, “potential”, “scheduled”, “estimates”, “forecasts”, “intends”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “projects”, or the negatives thereof or\nvariations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results “will”, “should”, “may”, “could”, “would”,\n“might” or “will be taken”, “occur” or “be achieved” or the negative of these terms or comparable terminology.\nForward-looking statements are based on the reasonable assumptions, estimates, analysis and opinions of management made in\nlight of its experience and its perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments, as well as other factors that\nmanagement believes to be relevant and reasonable in the circumstances at the date that such statements are made, but which\nmay prove to be incorrect. We believe that the assumptions and expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are\nreasonable. We cannot assure you, however, that such statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events\ncould differ materially from those anticipated in such statements.

As of June 30, 2020,\nwe determined that we no longer qualify as a \"foreign private issuer,\" as defined in Rule 3b-4 of the Exchange Act, for the purposes\nof the informational requirements of the Exchange Act. As a result, effective January 1, 2021, we became subject to the proxy\nsolicitation rules under Section 14 of the Exchange Act and Regulation FD, and our officers, directors, and principal shareholders\nbecame subject to the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. We will\ncontinue to file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K with the SEC and\nwith the relevant Canadian securities regulatory authorities on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval\n(SEDAR).\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the JOBS Act, and as such, we have elected to comply with certain reduced\nU.S. public company reporting requirements.\nOverview\nWe provide an array of home medical equipment, services and supplies, specializing in post-acute respiratory care services in the\nUnited States. Our primary objective is to focus on the organic growth of the business and thereby solidify our position as one of\nthe United States’ largest providers of in-home therapy for patients suffering from respiratory diseases. Our respiratory care\nprograms are designed specifically for payors to have the ability to treat patients in the home for less total cost and with a superior\nquality of care. Our services include respiratory disease management (through the rental of various HME devices), neuromuscular\ncare, in-home sleep testing and sleep apnea treatment, oxygen therapy, and the sale of associated supplies.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue through the rental of non-invasive and invasive ventilators which represented 55.4% and\n59.4% of our revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 56.5% and 61.4% for the six months\nended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We combine the benefits of home ventilation support with licensed Respiratory\nTherapists (\"RTs\") to drive improved patient outcomes and reduce costly hospital readmissions.\nWe expect to grow through expansion of existing service areas as well as in new territories through a cost efficient launch that\nreduces location expenses. We currently serve patients in all 50 states. We expect to continue to employ more RTs in order to\nassure our high service model is accomplished in the home. As of June 30, 2024, we employed 392 licensed RTs, representing\napproximately 35% of our company-wide employee count. By focusing overhead costs on personnel that service the patient rather\nthan physical location costs, we anticipate that we will efficiently scale our business in regions that are currently not being\neffectively serviced.\nThe continued trend of servicing patients in the home rather than in hospitals is aligned with our business objective and we\nanticipate that this trend will continue to offer growth opportunities for us. We expect to continue to be a solution to the rising health\ncosts in the United States by offering more cost effective, home based solutions while increasing the quality of life for patients\nfighting serious respiratory diseases.\nPage 26\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\nTrends Affecting our Business\nHome medical equipment markets are witnessing sustained expansion, with a notable focus on the complex respiratory and\nObstructive Sleep Apnea (\"OSA\") device segments. Analysts in the industry anticipate a consistent and robust growth trajectory,\nprojecting Compound Annual Growth Rates (\"CAGR\") of approximately 6% for respiratory devices and 8% for OSA devices. This\nupward trend underscores the increasing demand for innovative solutions in respiratory care and sleep apnea management,\nhighlighting the industry's responsiveness to evolving healthcare needs. As technological advancements and awareness drive the\nadoption of these specialized devices, we believe the HME markets, particularly in respiratory and OSA, are positioned for\ncontinuous expansion, offering promising opportunities for both providers and consumers alike.\nThe aging population remains a pivotal driver for the industry, as the elderly, constituting a substantial portion of HME patients, are\nexpected to represent a higher percentage of the overall population. Projections from industry analysts indicate a consistent annual\ngrowth in the number of Medicare beneficiaries, contributing to ongoing patient volume growth. A significant contributing factor to\nthe industry's growth is the rising incidence of chronic diseases. Factors such as increasing obesity rates, consequences of past\nsmoking prevalence, under-diagnosis of certain health conditions, and higher diagnosis rates for chronic diseases collectively\nshape the industry. There is a notable shift towards home-based treatment for these conditions.\nThe industry is undergoing a transition to value-based healthcare, with both government and commercial payors increasingly\nadopting models that emphasize the transition of patients from acute care settings to home care. We believe HME providers are\nwell-positioned to benefit from this industry shift. Advancements in technology and medical equipment have led to an increased\nprevalence of in-home treatments. The broader range of treatments administered in patient homes is expected to continue growing.\nProjections from industry analysts indicate that U.S. home healthcare spending will increase, reaching $250 billion by 2031, with a\nCAGR of approximately 7%.\nMarket consolidation is a notable trend favoring larger, financially stable players. The decline in the number of smaller regional\nplayers is attributed to the capital investment and scale required to compete effectively. This has led to a more consolidated and\ncompetitive landscape in the DME market.\nDespite these positive trends, the industry faces challenges such as cost containment efforts of payors. The consolidation of\nmanaged care payors into larger purchasing groups has increased negotiating power, resulting in pricing pressure on HME\nproviders. In addition to ongoing negotiations relating to contract management with third party payors to secure fair reimbursement,\nHME providers are engaging in value-based contracting, focusing on outcomes and patient satisfaction. These value-based\ncontracts leverage data analytics to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and quality of durable medical goods and provide\nevidence-based data to payors demonstrating the long-term benefits and cost savings associated with the use of certain medical\ngoods.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe Company faces current and potential future inflationary pressures driven by factors such as general cost increases, supply\nchain disruptions, and governmental policies. The manufacturing and distribution costs of Viemed's patient equipment are affected\nby rising material, labor, and transportation expenses, including fuel costs. Persistent inflation may impact overall demand, increase\noperating costs, and affect profit margins, potentially adversely affecting Viemed's business and financial performance.\nIn its 2024 DMEPOS Fee Schedule, CMS announced the fee schedule adjustment based on the annual change to the Consumer\nPricing Index for all urban areas. Items that were subject to the competitive bidding program in former competitive bidding areas\nwill receive a 2.9% reimbursement rate increase. Items that were subject to the competitive bidding program in non-competitive\nbidding areas received a 3.0% reimbursement rate increase. Items not subject to the competitive bidding program received a 2.6%\nreimbursement rate increase.\nFuture volatility in general price inflation and its impact on material availability, shipping, warehousing, and operational overhead\ncould further impact financial results. Viemed attempts to address these pressures through its inflation-linked reimbursement\ncontracts, negotiation, leveraging its purchasing power and embracing technology, such as its proprietary clinical management\nplatform.\nPage 27\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe below table highlights summary financial and operational metrics for the last eight quarters.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except vent patients)\nJune 30, March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30,\nFor the quarter ended 2024 2024 2023 2023 2023 2023 2022 2022\nFinancial Information:\nRevenue $ 54,965 $ 50,593 $ 50,739 $ 49,402 $ 43,311 $ 39,556 $ 37,508 $ 35,759\nGross Profit 32,892 29,802 32,111 30,562 26,106 24,004 22,896 21,651\nGross Profit % 60 % 59 % 63 % 62 % 60 % 61 % 61 % 61 %\nNet Income 1,477 1,603 3,477 2,919 2,330 1,517 2,438 1,055\nCash (As of) 8,807 7,309 12,839 10,078 10,224 23,544 16,914 21,478\nTotal Assets (As of) 163,947 154,875 154,895 149,400 149,117 124,634 117,043 119,419\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) 12,813 10,098 12,845 12,081 9,810 8,328 9,306 6,982\nOperational Information:\nVent Patients(2) 10,905 10,450 10,327 10,244 10,005 9,337 9,306 9,127\n(1) Refer to \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section below for definition of Adjusted EBITDA.\n(2) Vent Patients represents the number of active ventilator patients on recurring billing service at the end of each calendar quarter.\nPage 28\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n% of Total % of Total $ %\n2024 Revenue 2023 Revenue Change Change\nRevenue $ 54,965 100.0 % $ 43,311 100.0 % $ 11,654 26.9 %\nCost of revenue 22,073 40.2 % 17,205 39.7 % 4,868 28.3 %\nGross profit 32,892 59.8 % 26,106 60.3 % 6,786 26.0 %\nSelling, general and administrative 26,503 48.2 % 20,563 47.5 % 5,940 28.9 %\nResearch and development 758 1.4 % 758 1.8 % — — %\nStock-based compensation 1,620 2.9 % 1,471 3.4 % 149 10.1 %\nDepreciation and amortization 377 0.7 % 298 0.7 % 79 26.5 %\nLoss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment (545) (1.0) % 117 0.3 % (662) (565.8) %\nOther expense (income), net 563 1.0 % (2) — % 565 NM\nIncome from operations 3,616 6.6 % 2,901 6.7 % 715 24.6 %\nNon-operating income and expenses\nIncome (expense) from investments (1,117) (2.0) % 137 0.3 % (1,254) (915.3) %\nInterest income (expense), net (254) (0.5) % 20 — % (274) (1370.0) %\nNet income before taxes 2,245 4.1 % 3,058 7.1 % (813) (26.6) %\nProvision for income taxes 768 1.4 % 728 1.7 % 40 5.5 %\nNet income 1,477 2.7 % 2,330 5.4 % (853) (36.6) %\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest 9 — % — — % 9 NM\nNet income attributable to Viemed Healthcare, Inc. $ 1,468 2.7 % $ 2,330 5.4 % $ (862) (37.0) %\nRevenue\nThe following table summarizes our revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n% of Total % of Total $ %\n2024 Revenue 2023 Revenue Change Change\nNet revenue from rentals\nVentilator rentals, non-invasive and invasive $ 30,445 55.4 % $ 25,712 59.4 % $ 4,733 18.4 %\nOther home medical equipment rentals 12,211 22.2 % 8,419 19.5 % 3,792 45.0 %\nNet revenue from sales and services\nEquipment and supply sales 7,378 13.4 % 6,778 15.6 % 600 8.9 %\nService revenues 4,931 9.0 % 2,402 5.5 % 2,529 105.3 %\nTotal net revenue $ 54,965 100.0 % $ 43,311 100.0 % $ 11,654 26.9 %\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, net revenue totaled $55.0 million, an increase of $11.7 million (or 26.9%) from the\ncomparable period in 2023. The primary driver of this growth was our ventilator rental revenue, which increased by $4.7\nmillion (or 18.4%) due to higher patient volumes associated with strong demand for ventilation services. Additionally, rental revenue\nfrom other Home Medical Equipment (HME) increased by $3.8 million (or 45.0%) attributable to an expanding patient census and\nrobust demand for oxygen therapy, Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) therapy, and percussion vest services. Equipment and supply\nsales grew by $0.6 million (or 8.9%) largely driven by the success of our sleep resupply program. Furthermore, services revenue\nexperienced an increase of $2.5 million (or 105.3%), primarily due to the growth of healthcare staffing offerings.\nPage 29\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\nWhile ventilator rentals continue to make up the majority of our revenue, the organic and acquired growth of PAP and oxygen\nrelated sales, as well as our healthcare staffing offerings, is contributing to the diversity of our overall revenue mix. As we continue\nto expand geographically into new territories and further expand our presence in our existing territories, we expect continued\ngrowth in our active ventilator patient base and our other respiratory offerings.\nCost of revenue and gross profit\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, cost of revenue totaled $22.1 million, an increase of $4.9 million (or 28.3%) from the\ncomparable period in 2023. Gross profit percentage decreased from approximately 60.3% in the three months ended June 30,\n2023 to approximately 59.8% in the three months ended June 30, 2024. The change in gross profit percentage is primarily due to\nmigration of the revenue mix associated with product and service diversification. Gross profit percentage is expected to remain\nrelatively stable in upcoming periods due to subsiding inflationary cost pressures and the positive effects associated with\nreimbursement rates, offset by some decreases associated with product and service diversification.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 48.2% for the three months ended June 30,\n2024 compared to 47.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $26.5\nmillion for the three months ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $5.9 million (or 28.9%) from the comparable prior period. The\noverall increase in selling, general and administrative expense as compared to the prior period is primarily attributable to additional\nemployee related expenses to accommodate the overall growth of the Company. Employee compensation expenses increased\n$3.6 million (or 23.8%) as a result of the increase in our employee headcount and increases in incentive and volume based\ncompensation. Legal and professional fees also increased by $0.7 million (or 99.4%) as a result of integrated audit fees and legal\nservices. We expect that current year selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will remain stable\nthrough the end of 2024 due to increased efficiencies and costs optimization efforts relative to revenue growth.\nResearch and development\nFor both the three months ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2024, research and development expense totaled $0.8 million. As we\ncontinue to invest in research and development related projects to support our technology initiatives, we expect that associated\ncosts will remain consistent in 2024 relative to 2023 costs, declining as a percentage of revenue.\nStock-based compensation\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, stock-based compensation totaled $1.6 million, an increase of 10.1% from the\ncomparable period in 2023. We anticipate that as we expand our workforce, incorporating stock-based awards as a component of\nemployee compensation, stock-based compensation expenses will correspondingly rise. Historically, revenue growth has outpaced\nthe growth in stock-based compensation, and as a result, the percentage of stock-based compensation relative to revenue is\nexpected to continue declining.\nLoss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, gain on disposal of property and equipment totaled $0.5 million compared to loss on\ndisposal of property and equipment of $0.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The gain primarily resulted from\nproceeds related to the sale of recalled ventilators back to the manufacturer. We anticipate additional future gains from the disposal\nof eligible devices, as the proceeds from these disposals are expected to exceed their net book value.\nOther expense (income), net\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, other expense (income), net totaled $0.6 million, an increase of $0.6 million from the\ncomparable period in 2023. The increase in other expense (income), net is primarily due to an impairment of a litigation receivable\nof $0.9 million determined to be unrealizable as a result of the counterparty's bankruptcy proceedings.\nIncome (expense) from investments\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, expense from investments totaled $1.1 million compared to income from investments\nof $0.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The change is primarily due to a $1.3 million impairment recognized on\nour debt investment, reflecting an other-than-temporary impairment in fair value during the period.\nPage 30\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\nInterest income (expense), net\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, net interest expense totaled $0.3 million, an increase of $0.3 million from the\ncomparable period in 2023. The increase in net interest expense is primarily due to outstanding borrowings as a result of debt\nissued to fund acquisitions. However, with anticipated debt repayments, we expect a reduction in quarterly net interest expense for\nthe remainder of 2024.\nProvision for income taxes\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, the provision for income taxes was a $0.8 million expense, compared to $0.7 million\nduring the comparable period in 2023. The resulting increase in the overall effective tax rate as a percentage of pre-tax income was\ndue to the impact of discrete tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation between periods. Our annual estimated\neffective tax rate for 2024 is 30.9%.\nNet income\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, net income was $1.5 million, a decrease of $0.9 million (or 36.6%) from the\ncomparable period in 2023. Net income as a percentage of net revenue decreased from 5.4% for the three months ended June 30,\n2023 to 2.7% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to fair value impairments of a debt investment and\noutstanding litigation funds receivable.\nPage 31\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\nComparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023:\nSix Months Ended June 30,\n% of Total % of Total $ %\n2024 Revenue 2023 Revenue Change Change\nRevenue $ 105,558 100.0 % $ 82,867 100.0 % $ 22,691 27.4 %\nCost of revenue 42,864 40.6 % 32,757 39.5 % 10,107 30.9 %\nGross profit 62,694 59.4 % 50,110 60.5 % 12,584 25.1 %\nSelling, general and administrative 51,317 48.6 % 40,325 48.7 % 10,992 27.3 %\nResearch and development 1,508 1.4 % 1,538 1.9 % (30) (2.0) %\nStock-based compensation 3,052 2.9 % 2,862 3.5 % 190 6.6 %\nDepreciation and amortization 792 0.8 % 538 0.6 % 254 47.2 %\nLoss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment (332) (0.3) % 95 0.1 % (427) (449.5) %\nOther expense (income), net 537 0.5 % (83) (0.1) % 620 (747.0) %\nIncome from operations 5,820 5.5 % 4,835 5.8 % 985 20.4 %\nNon-operating income and expenses\nIncome (expense) from investments (1,050) (1.0) % 172 0.2 % (1,222) (710.5) %\nInterest income (expense), net (404) (0.4) % 69 0.1 % (473) (685.5) %\nNet income before taxes 4,366 4.1 % 5,076 6.1 % (710) (14.0) %\nProvision for income taxes 1,286 1.2 % 1,229 1.5 % 57 4.6 %\nNet income 3,080 2.9 % 3,847 4.6 % (767) (19.9) %\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest 9 — % — — % 9 NM\nNet income attributable to Viemed Healthcare, Inc. $ 3,071 2.9 % $ 3,847 4.6 % $ (776) (20.2) %\nRevenue\nThe following table summarizes our revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023:\nSix Months Ended June 30,\n% of Total % of Total $ %\n2024 Revenue 2023 Revenue Change Change\nNet revenue from rentals\nVentilator rentals, non-invasive and invasive $ 59,632 56.5 % $ 50,859 61.4 % $ 8,773 17.2 %\nOther home medical equipment rentals 23,145 21.9 % 15,325 18.5 % 7,820 51.0 %\nNet revenue from sales and services\nEquipment and supply sales 13,516 12.8 % 11,542 13.9 % 1,974 17.1 %\nService revenues 9,265 8.7 % 5,141 6.2 % 4,124 80.2 %\nTotal net revenue $ 105,558 100.0 % $ 82,867 100.0 % $ 22,691 27.4 %\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, revenue totaled $105.6 million, an increase of $22.7 million (or 27.4%) from the\ncomparable period in 2023.

As we\ncontinue to invest in research and development related projects to support our technology initiatives, we expect that associated\ncosts will remain consistent in 2024 relative to 2023 costs, declining as a percentage of revenue.\nStock-based compensation\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, stock-based compensation totaled $3.1 million, an increase of 6.6% from the comparable\nperiod in 2023. We anticipate that as we expand our workforce, incorporating stock-based awards as a component of employee\ncompensation, stock-based compensation expenses will correspondingly rise. Historically, revenue growth has outpaced the\ngrowth in stock-based compensation, and as a result, the percentage of stock-based compensation relative to revenue is expected\nto continue declining.\nLoss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, gain on disposal of property and equipment totaled $0.3 million compared to loss on\ndisposal of property and equipment of $0.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The gain primarily resulted from\nproceeds related to the sale of recalled ventilators back to the manufacturer. We anticipate additional future gains from the disposal\nof eligible devices, as the proceeds from these disposals are expected to exceed their net book value.\nOther expense (income), net\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, other expense (income), net totaled $0.5 million, an increase of $0.6 million from the\ncomparable period in 2023. The increase in other expense (income), net is primarily due to an impairment of a litigation receivable\nof $0.9 million determined to be unrealizable as a result of the counterparty's bankruptcy proceedings.\nIncome (expense) from investments\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, expense from investments totaled $1.1 million compared to income from investments of\n$0.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The change is primarily due to a $1.3 million impairment recognized on our\ndebt investment, reflecting an other-than-temporary impairment in fair value during the period.\nPage 33\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\nInterest income (expense), net\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, net interest expense totaled $0.4 million compared to interest income of $0.1 million for\nthe six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in net interest expense is primarily due to outstanding borrowings as a result of\ndebt issued to fund acquisitions. However, with anticipated debt repayments, we expect a reduction in net interest expense for the\nremainder of 2024.\nProvision for income taxes\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, the provision for income taxes was a $1.3 million expense, compared to $1.2 million\nduring the comparable period in 2023. The resulting increase in the overall effective tax rate as a percentage of pre-tax income was\ndue to the impact of discrete tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation between periods. Our annual estimated\neffective tax rate for 2024 is 30.9%.\nNet income\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, net income was $3.1 million, a decrease of $0.8 million (or 19.9%) from the comparable\nperiod in 2023. Net income as a percentage of net revenue decreased from 4.6% for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to 2.9%\nfor the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to fair value impairments of a debt investment and outstanding litigation\nfunds receivable.\nPage 34\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company uses Adjusted EBITDA, which is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") to analyze its financial results and believes that it is useful to investors, as a\nsupplement to GAAP measures. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information with respect to the\nCompany’s operating performance as viewed by management, including a view of the Company’s business that is not dependent\non the impact of the Company’s capitalization structure and items that are not part of the Company’s day-to-day operations.\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA (i) to compare the Company’s operating performance on a consistent basis, (ii) to calculate\nincentive compensation for the Company’s employees, (iii) for planning purposes, including the preparation of the Company’s\ninternal annual operating budget, and (iv) to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the Company’s operational strategies.\nAccordingly, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in understanding and evaluating the\nCompany’s operating performance in the same manner as management. In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, certain items (mostly\nnon-cash) are excluded from net income including depreciation and amortization of capitalized assets, net interest expense\n(income), stock based compensation, transactions costs, impairment of assets, and taxes.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of Net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, on a\nhistorical basis for the periods indicated:\nJune 30, March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30,\nFor the quarter ended 2024 2024 2023 2023 2023 2023 2022 2022\nNet income attributable to\nViemed Healthcare, Inc. $ 1,468 $ 1,603 $ 3,477 $ 2,919 $ 2,330 $ 1,517 $ 2,438 $ 1,055\nAdd back:\nDepreciation & amortization 6,309 6,285 5,918 5,975 5,207 4,762 4,373 4,120\nInterest expense (income) 254 150 256 237 (20) (49) 32 42\nStock-based compensation(a) 1,620 1,432 1,534 1,453 1,471 1,391 1,317 1,309\nTransaction costs(b) 221 110 61 177 94 206 — —\nImpairment of assets(c) 2,173 — — — — — — —\nIncome tax expense 768 518 1,599 1,320 728 501 1,146 456\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 12,813 $ 10,098 $ 12,845 $ 12,081 $ 9,810 $ 8,328 $ 9,306 $ 6,982\n(a) Represents non-cash, equity-based compensation expense associated with option and RSU awards.\n(b) Represents transaction costs and expenses related to acquisition and integration efforts associated with recently announced or\ncompleted acquisitions.\n(c) Represents impairments of the fair value of investment and litigation-related assets.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in\naccordance with GAAP. It is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an\nalternative to revenue or net income, as applicable, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an\nalternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of the Company's liquidity, and may not be comparable to other\nsimilarly titled measures of other companies or businesses. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not\nbe considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA does\nnot reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of ongoing operations; and\nother companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative\nmeasure.\nPage 35\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2024 was $8.8 million, compared to $12.8 million at December 31, 2023. Typically, our\nprincipal source of liquidity is the collection of our patient accounts receivable. In addition to our collection of patient accounts\nreceivable, from time to time, we can and do obtain additional sources of liquidity by the incurrence of additional indebtedness.\nBased on our current plan of operations, we believe cash and cash equivalents, when combined with expected cash flows from\noperations and amounts available under our 2022 Senior Credit Facilities will be sufficient to fund our growth strategy and to meet\nour anticipated operating expenses, capital expenditures, and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months from the date\nof this filing. The Company has also historically utilized short term financing arrangements with suppliers that could be extended\nover a longer term if there was a need for additional liquidity.\nThe Company had historically utilized Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, to submit patient claims to certain\nnon-Medicare payors for reimbursement. UnitedHealth Group announced that on February 21, 2024, Change Healthcare’s\ninformation technology systems were impacted by a cybersecurity incident. Although this incident did not impact our day-to-day\noperations or patient care delivery, it did cause delays in submitting patient claims to certain payors. By the end of the second\nquarter of 2024, the Company had replaced Change Healthcare as its clearinghouse and resumed claims submissions using\nalternative platforms for all claims. However, the delayed claims submissions resulted in a temporary reduction of our operating\ncash flow and an increase to our accounts receivable during the six months ended June 30, 2024.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nSix Months Ended June 30,\n2024 2023\nNet Cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 11,357 $ 18,119\nInvesting activities (16,532) (36,112)\nFinancing activities 1,143 11,303\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (4,032) $ (6,690)\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $11.4 million, resulting from net income\nof $3.1 million, increased by net income adjustments of $16.5 million and offset by an increase in non-cash working capital of $8.2\nmillion. The net income adjustments primarily consisted of $12.6 million of depreciation and amortization, $3.1 million of stock-\nbased compensation, and a net loss from debt investment of $1.2 million. The primary changes in non-cash working capital were\nan increase in net accounts receivable of $8.2 million and a net change in income tax receivable of $2.6 million, partially offset by\nan increase in trade payables of $1.1 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $18.1 million, resulting from net income\nof $3.8 million, increased by net income adjustments of $12.3 million and a change in non-cash working capital of $2.0 million. The\nnet income adjustments primarily consisted of $10.0 million of depreciation and amortization, $2.9 million of stock-based\ncompensation, $0.2 million gain on equity investments and a $0.7 million change in deferred tax asset. The primary changes in\nnon-cash working capital were an increase in net accounts receivable of $0.5 million, and an increase in income taxes receivable of\n$1.0 million, offset by a decrease in other assets of $2.1 million and an increase in accrued liabilities of $1.6 million.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $16.5 million. Net cash used in investing\nactivities during the period consisted of $14.9 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $1.4 million of\nsales proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment. Purchases of property and equipment were primarily related to\nmedical equipment rented to our patients. Cash purchases of property and equipment represents a $4.2 million, or 38.9%, increase\nyear over year. Net cash used in investing activities also included $3.0 million of net cash paid for the acquisition of HomeMed.\nPage 36\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\nNet cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $36.1 million, primarily due to the net cash\npaid for the acquisition of HMP of $27.1 million. Net cash used in investing activities during the period also included $10.8 million of\npurchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $1.8 million of sales proceeds from the disposal of property and\nequipment. Purchases of property and equipment were primarily related to medical equipment rented to our patients.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $1.1 million. For the six months ended\nJune 30, 2024, proceeds from the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) were $3.0 million, which was used to fund the\nHomeMed acquisition. Principal payments on the 2022 Term Loan Facility (as defined below) were $0.1 million. Additionally,\nprincipal payments on acquired loans were $0.7 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024. The Company acquired and\ncancelled 129,983 common shares at a cost of $1.0 million to satisfy employee income tax withholding associated with RSUs\nvestings while proceeds from the exercise of options during the six months ended June 30, 2024 were $0.3 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $11.3 million. For the six months ended\nJune 30, 2023, proceeds from the 2022 Term Loan Facility (as defined below) were $5.0 million and proceeds from the 2022\nRevolving Credit Facility (as defined below) were $8.0 million, which were used to partially fund the cash acquisition of HMP.\nPrincipal payments on acquired revolving and term loans were $2.4 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023. The\nCompany acquired and cancelled 66,734 common shares at a cost of $0.5 million to satisfy employee income tax withholding\nassociated with RSUs vestings while proceeds from the exercise of options during the six months ended June 30, 2024 were $1.2\nmillion.\nSources of Liquidity\nOur principal source of liquidity is our operating cash flow, which is supplemented by extended payment terms from our suppliers\nand amounts available under the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities.\nSenior Credit Facilities\nOn November 29, 2022, the Company refinanced its existing borrowings under the prior Commercial Business Loan Agreement\nwith Hancock Whitney Bank and entered into a new credit agreement (the \"2022 Senior Credit Facilities\") with the lenders from\ntime to time party thereto, and Regions Bank, as administrative agent and collateral agent, that provides for an up to $30.0 million\nrevolving credit facility (the \"2022 Revolving Credit Facility\") and an up to $30.0 million delayed draw term loan facility (the \"2022\nTerm Loan Facility\"), both maturing in November 2027. On May 28, 2024, the Company entered into a First Amendment to the\n2022 Senior Credit Facilities that (a) extends the delayed draw term loan commitment expiration date to November 29, 2025, from\nits initial expiration date of May 29, 2024, and (b) provides for other technical amendments.\nThe proceeds of the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility may be used to refinance existing indebtedness, for working capital purposes,\ncapital expenditures and other general corporate purposes (including permitted acquisitions), and to pay transaction fees, costs\nand expenses related to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities. The proceeds of the 2022 Term Loan Facility and any additional term\nloans established in accordance with the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities may be used to finance permitted acquisitions and to pay\ntransaction fees, costs and expenses related to such acquisitions. Outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Term Loan Facility and\n2022 Revolving Credit Facility were $4.8 million and $5.0 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2024.\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are Term SOFR plus an applicable margin, which\nranges from 2.625% to 3.375%, or, at the option of the Company, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities) plus\nan applicable margin, which ranges from 1.625% to 2.375%.\nThe 2022 Senior Credit Facilities require the Company to comply with certain affirmative, as well as certain negative covenants\nthat, among other things, will restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur indebtedness, grant liens,\nmake investments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations and pay dividends and other restricted payments. The 2022\nSenior Credit Facilities also include certain financial covenants, which generally include, but are not limited to the following:\n• Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (defined generally as total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than (i) for\nany fiscal quarter ending during the period from the closing date to and including December 31, 2024, 2.75 to 1.0 and (ii)\nfor any fiscal quarter ending on and after March 31, 2025, 2.50 to 1.0, subject to certain adjustments following a material\nacquisition.\nPage 37\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\n• Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (defined generally as (a) adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditures minus\ncash taxes to (b) the sum of scheduled principal payments plus cash interest expense plus restricted payments) of not\nless than 1.25:1.0.\nThe Company was in compliance with all covenants under the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities in effect at June 30, 2024.\nUse of Funds\nOur principal uses of cash are funding the purchase of rental assets and other capital purchases, the repayment of debt, funding of\nacquisitions, operations, and other working capital requirements. Our contractual obligations primarily relate to the repayment of\nexisting debt and contractual obligations for operating and finance leases. The following table presents our material contractual\nobligations and commitments to make future payments as of June 30, 2024:\nWithin 12 Months Beyond 12 Months\nDebt Obligations, including interest $ 1,534 $ 10,966\nLease Obligations 1,047 2,416\nTotal $ 2,581 $ 13,382\nExcept for the funding of potential acquisitions and investments, we anticipate that our operating cash flows will satisfy our material\ncash requirements for the 12 months after June 30, 2024. In addition to our operating cash flows, we may need to raise additional\nfunds to support our contractual obligations and investing activities beyond such 12 month period, and such funding may not be\navailable to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, our operations and ability to\nexecute our business strategy could be adversely affected. We may seek to raise additional funds through equity, equity-linked or\ndebt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness would have rights that are\nsenior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. Any additional equity financing\nmay be dilutive to our stockholders.\nLeases\nLeases under which we assume substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon initial\nrecognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lesser of its fair value and the present value of the minimum\nlease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to\nthe asset. The associated lease liability is drawn down over the life of the lease by allocating a portion of each lease payment to the\nliability with the remainder being recognized as finance charges. Leases that do not transfer the risks and rewards of ownership to\nthe Company are treated as operating leases and are expensed as incurred.\nRetirement Plan\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) retirement plan for employees to which eligible employees can contribute a percentage of their\npre-tax compensation. Matching employer contributions to the 401(k) plan totaled $338,000 and $325,000 for the three months\nended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $873,000 and $735,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nOff balance sheet arrangements\nThe Company has no material undisclosed off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or\nfuture effect on its results of operations or financial condition.\nAccounting and Disclosure Matters\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe are required to disclose “critical accounting estimates” which are estimates made in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and that have had or are reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nPage 38\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\nWe follow financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States. The more significant of these policies are summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in\nPart II, Item 8 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Not all significant accounting\npolicies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments. However, the policy noted below could be deemed\nto meet the SEC’s definition of a critical accounting estimate.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are presented at net realizable values that reflect the consideration we expect to receive which is inclusive of\nadjustments for price concessions. Due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate,\ncertain estimates are required in order to record revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Management’s\nevaluation takes into consideration such factors as historical realization data, including current and historical cash collections,\naccounts receivable aging trends, other operating trends and relevant business conditions.\nInherent in these estimates is the risk that they may have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. It\nis possible that management’s estimates could change, which could have an impact on operations and cash flows. Specifically, the\ncomplexity of many third-party billing arrangements, patient qualification for medical necessity of equipment and the uncertainty of\nreimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. If the\npayment amount received differs from the estimated net realizable amount, an adjustment is made to the net realizable amount in\nthe period that these payment differences are determined.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of\nrecently issued accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of\noperations, financial positions and cash flows.\nPage 39\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOur exposure to market risk primarily relates to fluctuations in interest rates from borrowings under the 2022 Senior Credit\nFacilities. The interest rates per annum applicable to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are Term SOFR plus an applicable margin,\nwhich ranges from 2.625% to 3.375%, or, at the option of the Company, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2022 Senior Credit\nFacilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 1.625% to 2.375%. Outstanding borrowings subject to interest rate\nfluctuations under the 2022 Term Loan Facility and 2022 Revolving Credit Facility were $4.8 million and $5.0 million, respectively,\nas of June 30, 2024. Based on our outstanding borrowings, an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a\nmaterial effect on our net income.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to\nRule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded:\ni. that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure (a) that information required to be\ndisclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized\nand reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and (b) that such information is accumulated\nand communicated to the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as\nappropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and\nii. that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that the Company's disclosures controls and procedures will detect or\nuncover all failures of persons within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries to disclose material information otherwise\nrequired to be set forth in the Company's periodic reports. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of\ndisclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and\nprocedures.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended June 30,\n2024 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial\nreporting.\nPage 40\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to various ongoing or threatened legal actions and other proceedings, including those that\narise in the ordinary course of business, which may include employment matters, breach of contract disputes, as well as\ngovernmental and regulatory matters. Please read Note 9—Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nNone.\nCompany Repurchases of Equity Securities\nNone.\nDividends\nWe have not declared or paid any cash or stock dividends on our common shares since our inception. Any future determination as\nto the declaration and payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend on then-existing conditions,\nincluding our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and other\nfactors that the Board considers relevant.

Nature of Business and Operations\nViemed Healthcare, Inc. (the \"Company\"), through its subsidiaries, is a provider of home medical equipment (\"HME\") and post-\nacute respiratory healthcare services in the United States. The Company’s service offerings are focused on effective in-home\ntreatment with clinical practitioners providing therapy and counseling to patients in their homes using cutting edge technology. The\nCompany serves patients in all 50 states of the United States. The Company was incorporated under the Business Corporations\nAct (British Columbia) on December 14, 2016. The Company's registered and records office is located at Suite 2800, Park Place,\n666 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia V6C 2Z7 and its corporate office is located at 625 E. Kaliste Saloom Road,\nLafayette, Louisiana 70508.\nThe Company no longer qualifies as a “smaller reporting company” and is required to comply with the larger company disclosure\nobligations (subject to certain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to emerging growth\ncompanies) beginning in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nThe Company is an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \"JOBS Act\"), and as\nsuch, has elected to comply with certain reduced U.S. public company reporting requirements.\nThe Company’s common shares are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \"VMD\".\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and\nfootnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements\nare unaudited, but reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals, which, in the opinion of management, are\nnecessary to present fairly the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nIncome and Comprehensive Income, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity and Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the interim periods presented. The Company's fiscal year ends on December 31. The\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023 was derived from audited consolidated financial statements but\ndoes not include all disclosures required by GAAP. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in\nconjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the report of the Company's independent\nregistered public accounting firm included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe nature of the Company's business is such that the results of any interim period may not be indicative of the results to be\nexpected for the entire year.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany\ntransactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date\nof the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiod. Management bases these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience, existing and known circumstances,\nauthoritative accounting pronouncements and other factors that management believes to be reasonable. Significant areas requiring\nthe use of management estimates relate to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, income tax provisions, the fair value of\nfinancial instruments, and goodwill. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nPage 7\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company’s chief operating decision-makers (\"CODMs\") are its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, who make\nresource allocation decisions and assess performance based on financial information presented on an aggregate basis. There are\nno segment managers who are held accountable by the chief operating decision-makers, or anyone else, for any planning, strategy\nand key decision-making regarding operations. The corporate office is responsible for contract negotiation with vendors and\npayors, corporate compliance with healthcare laws and regulations, and revenue cycle management, among other corporate\nsupporting functions. Accordingly, the Company has a single reportable segment and operating segment structure based on ASC\n280, Segment Reporting.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable and net revenues are based on contractually agreed-upon rates for services provided, reduced by estimated\nadjustments, including variable consideration for implicit price concessions for sales revenue. Inherent in these estimates is the risk\nthat they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. The complexity of third-party billing\narrangements and laws and regulations governing Medicare and Medicaid may result in adjustments to amounts originally\nrecorded.\nThe Company performs a periodic analysis to review the valuation of accounts receivable and collectability of outstanding\nbalances. These estimates are determined utilizing historical realization data under a portfolio approach, which is then assessed by\nmanagement to evaluate whether adjustments should be made based on accounts receivable aging trends, other operating trends,\nand relevant business conditions such as governmental and managed care payor claims processing procedures.\nThe Company records a reserve for estimated probable losses as part of net rental revenue adjustments in order to report rental\nrevenue at an expected collectable amount based on the total portfolio of operating lease receivables for which collectability has\nbeen deemed probable. The accounts receivable are presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets net of the\nadjustments.\nReceivables are considered past due when not collected by established due dates. Specific patient balances are written off after\ncollection efforts have been followed and the account has been determined to be uncollectible. Revisions in reserve estimates are\nrecorded as an adjustment to net revenue in the period of revision. The estimates of the allowance for uncollectible accounts was\n$14.4 million and $11.1 million as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nIncluded in accounts receivable at March 31, 2024 are amounts due from Medicare and Medicaid, representing 25% and 2%,\nrespectively, and 27% combined, of total outstanding receivables. As of December 31, 2023, 32% of total outstanding receivables\nwere amounts due from Medicare and Medicaid.\nInventory\nInventory represents non-serialized supplies that consist of equipment parts, consumables, and associated product supplies and is\nexpensed at the time of sale or use. The Company values inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Obsolete and\nunserviceable inventories are valued at estimated net realizable value.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at historic cost less accumulated\ndepreciation. Major renewals and improvements that extend the useful life of assets are capitalized to the respective property\naccounts, while maintenance and repairs, which do not extend the useful life of the respective assets, are expensed as incurred.\nManagement has estimated the useful lives of equipment leased to customers. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis\nover their estimated useful lives.\nDepreciation of medical equipment commences at the date of service, which represents the date that the asset has been delivered\nto a patient and is put in use and continues through the useful life of the asset. Property and equipment with definite useful lives are\ntested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nPage 8\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\nEquity Investments\nEquity investments on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are comprised of an investment accounted for under the\nequity method and equity investments without readily determinable fair values accounted for under the measurement alternative\ndescribed in ASC 321-10-35-2.\nThe following table details the Company’s equity investments:\nMarch 31, 2024 December 31, 2023\nEquity method investments $ 338 $ 320\nOther equity investments 1,360 1,360\nBalance, end of period $ 1,698 $ 1,680\nThe Company's equity method investments include a 49% equity interest in Solvet Services, LLC, an entity which provides health\ncare support services to state and federal governments. Investments accounted for under the equity method are investments in\nunconsolidated entities over whose operating and financial policies the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence but\nnot control. Equity method investments are initially measured at cost in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with any\nsubsequent adjustments made to the carrying amount of the investment for the Company’s proportionate share of income or loss.\nDistributions received from the investee reduce the Company’s carrying value of the investment. The Company has recognized its\nshare of income or loss on the gain (loss) from equity method investments within non-operating expenses in the Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Equity method investments are evaluated for impairment\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investments may exceed the fair value. No\nevents or changes have occurred as of March 31, 2024 that would impair the carrying value of equity method investments.\nOther equity investments are investments without a readily determinable fair value which do not qualify for the practical expedient\nin ASC 820. For these investments, the Company has elected the measurement alternative which measures the investment at cost,\nless any impairment. ASU 2019-04 clarifies that if an entity identifies observable price changes in orderly transactions for the\nidentical or a similar investment of the same issuer, it must measure its equity investment at fair value in accordance with ASC 820\nas of the date that the observable transaction occurred. The Company was not aware of any impairment or observable price\nchange adjustments that needed to be made as of March 31, 2024 on its investments in equity securities without a readily\ndeterminable fair value.\nDebt Investment\nThe Company's debt investment is a variable rate secured convertible note issued by Healthcare DX, Inc. (d/b/a ModoHealth) on\nDecember 21, 2022, classified as an available-for-sale debt instrument. Accrued interest is due upon the 18 month maturity of the\nnote and is included in the amortized cost basis at each reporting period. At each financial statement date until a conversion event,\nthe debt instrument is required to be remeasured at fair value. Changes in unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated\nother comprehensive income, net of tax effect, until realized.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets include trade names and other identifiable intangible assets, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over a\nperiod of their expected useful lives, generally five years.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income reflects the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events\nand circumstances from non-owner sources. The Company's comprehensive income represents net income adjusted for unrealized\ngains and losses, net of tax. Accumulated other comprehensive loss is presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated\nBalance Sheets as a component of shareholders' equity.\nPage 9\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are principally derived from the rental and sale of HME products and services to patients.\nRental revenues\nRevenue generated from equipment that is rented to patients is recognized over the non-cancellable rental period (typically one\nmonth) and commences on delivery of the equipment to the patients. The lease agreements are evaluated at lease\ncommencement and the start of each monthly renewal period to determine if it is reasonably certain that the monthly renewal or\npurchase options would be exercised. The exercise of monthly renewal or purchase options by a patient has historically not been\nreasonably certain to occur at lease commencement or subsequent monthly renewal.\nRevenues are recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with third-party payors, including\nprivate insurers, prepaid health plans, Medicare, Medicaid and patients. Rental revenue, less estimated adjustments, is recognized\nas earned on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable lease term. Rental of patient equipment is billed on a monthly basis\nbeginning on the date the equipment is delivered. Since deliveries can occur on any day during a month, the amount of billings that\napply to the next month are deferred.\nThe Company's lease agreements generally contain lease components and non-lease components, which primarily relate to\nsupplies. The Company has made the accounting policy election to account for a lease component of an agreement and its\nassociated non-lease components as a single lease component based on the Company's assessment of classification of the lease\nbased on the consideration in the contract for the combined component.\nSales and Services revenues\nRevenue related to sales of equipment and supplies is recognized on the date of delivery as this is when control of the promised\ngoods is transferred to patients and is presented net of applicable sales taxes. Revenues are recorded only to the extent it is\nprobable that a significant reversal will not occur in the future as amounts may include implicit price concessions under\nreimbursement arrangements with third-party payors, including private insurers, prepaid health plans, Medicare, Medicaid and\npatients. The sales transaction price is determined based on contractually agreed-upon rates, adjusted for estimates of variable\nconsideration. The expected value method is used in determining the variable consideration as part of determining the sales\ntransaction price using historical reimbursement experience, historical sales returns, and other operating trends. Payment terms\nand conditions vary by contract. The timing of revenue recognition, billing, and cash collection generally results in billed and\nunbilled accounts receivable.\nRevenues associated with external staffing services are accrued on an hourly basis and are recorded based on the determination\nof whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent. In arrangements in which the Company manages customers'\nsupplemental workforce needs utilizing its own network of healthcare professionals, the Company is determined to be a principal\nand includes the contractual gross billings in revenues with a corresponding increase to cost of revenues for worksite employee\npayroll costs associated with these services. Alternatively, when the Company acts as agent in the performance of workforce\nmanagement, revenue is recorded based on contractually agreed upon fees or commissions with no associated cost of revenues.\nThe revenues from each major source are summarized in the following table:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2024 2023\nRevenue from rentals\nVentilator rentals, non-invasive and invasive $ 29,187 $ 25,147\nOther home medical equipment rentals 10,934 6,906\nRevenue from sales and services\nEquipment and supply sales 6,138 4,764\nService revenues 4,334 2,739\nTotal revenues $ 50,593 $ 39,556\nPage 10\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\nRevenues from Medicare as percentages of the Company's total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\nwere 43% and 45%, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, \"Compensation—Stock Compensation\",\nwhich establishes accounting for share-based awards exchanged for employee services and requires companies to expense the\nestimated fair value of these awards over the requisite employee service period. Stock–based compensation costs for stock\noptions are determined at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Stock-based compensation costs for\nrestricted stock units (\"RSUs\") are determined at the grant date based on the closing stock price. The expense of such stock-based\ncompensation awards is recognized using the graded vesting attribution method over the vesting period and the offsetting credit is\nrecorded as an increase in additional paid-in capital. Forfeitures are recorded as incurred. Any excess tax benefit or deficiency is\nrecognized as a component of income taxes and within operating cash flows upon vesting of the share-based award.\nFor the Company’s phantom share units settled in cash, the Company computes the fair value of the phantom share units using the\nclosing price of the Company's stock at the end of each period and records a liability based on the percentage of requisite service.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in numerous U.S. jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the\nprovision for income taxes. The Company's income tax provisions reflect management’s interpretation of country and state tax\nlaws. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course\nof business and may remain uncertain for several years after their occurrence. The Company recognizes assets and liabilities for\ntaxation when it is probable that the Company will receive refunds from or pay taxes to the relevant tax authority. Where the final\ndetermination of tax assets and liabilities is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the\ncurrent and deferred income taxes provision in the period in which such a determination is made. Changes in tax law or changes in\nthe way tax law is interpreted may also impact the Company's effective tax rate as well as the Company's business and operations.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future income tax consequences attributable to temporary\ndifferences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases. Deferred\nincome tax assets or liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in\nwhich those temporary differences are expected to be settled. The calculation of current and deferred income taxes requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions and to exercise a certain amount of judgment concerning the carrying value of\nassets and liabilities. The current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are also impacted by expectations about future\noperating results and the timing of reversal of temporary differences as well as possible audits of tax filings by regulatory agencies.\nChanges or differences in these estimates or assumptions may result in changes to the current and deferred tax assets and\nliabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and a charge to or recovery of income tax expense.\nDeferred tax is recognized on any temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated\nfinancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable earnings. The effect of a change in the\nenacted tax rates is recognized in net earnings and comprehensive income or in equity depending on the item to which the\nadjustment relates. At each reporting period end, deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability based on whether it is more\nlikely than not that sufficient taxable earnings will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business acquisitions. The results of operations of the business\nacquired by the Company are included as of the respective acquisition date. The acquisition-date fair value of the consideration\ntransferred, including the fair value of any contingent consideration, is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. To the extent the acquisition-date fair value of the\nconsideration transferred exceeds the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed,\nsuch excess is allocated to goodwill. Patient relationships, medical records and patient lists are not reported as separate intangible\nassets due to the regulatory requirements and lack of contractual agreements but are part of goodwill. Customer related\nrelationships are not reported as separate intangible assets but are part of goodwill as authorizing physicians are under no\nobligation to refer the Company’s services to their patients, who are free to change physicians and service providers at any time.\nThe Company may adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, as it obtains more information regarding asset\nvaluations and liabilities assumed that existed but were not available at the acquisition date, which is generally up to one year after\nPage 11\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\nthe acquisition closing date. Acquisition related costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed\nas incurred.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill resulting from business combinations is not amortized, rather, it is assessed for impairment annually and upon the\noccurrence of a triggering event or change in circumstances indicating a possible impairment. Such triggering events potentially\nwarranting an annual or interim goodwill impairment assessment include, among other factors, declines in historical or projected\nrevenue, operating income or cash flows, and sustained decreases in the Company’s stock price or market capitalization. Such\nchanges in circumstance can include, among others, changes in the legal environment, reimbursement environment, operating\nperformance, and/or future prospects.\nThe Company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year. The impairment\nassessment can be performed on either a quantitative or qualitative basis. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to\ndetermine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. If determined necessary, the Company\napplies the quantitative impairment test to identify and measure the amount of impairment, if any. Fair value determinations require\nconsiderable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors, such as estimates of a reporting unit's\nfair value and judgment about impairment triggering events. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and\nassumptions made for purposes of the annual or interim goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company performed an assessment of qualitative factors and determined that no\nevents or circumstances existed that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived\nassets were less than the carrying amount. As such, a quantitative analysis was not required to be performed and the Company did\nnot record any goodwill impairment charges.\nThe Company follows ASC Topic 360, which requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the asset group’s carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In performing the review for\nrecoverability, if future undiscounted cash flows (excluding interest charges) from the use and ultimate disposition of the assets are\nless than their carrying values, an impairment loss represented by the difference between its fair value and carrying value, is\nrecognized. When properties are classified as held for sale, they are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or the expected\nsales price less costs to sell. There were no impairment charges recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and\nMarch 31, 2023.\nNet Income per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nBasic net income per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding\nduring the period. Diluted net income per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of\ncommon stock plus the effect of dilutive stock-based awards outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.\nDilutive stock-based awards include outstanding common stock options and time-based RSUs.\nSee Note 11 for earnings per share computations.\nPage 12\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, Liabilities — Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of\nSupplier Finance Program Obligations, which requires entities that use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase\nof goods and services to disclose the key terms of the programs and information about their obligations that are outstanding at the\nend of the reporting period. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022,\nincluding interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company adopted this standard during the year ended December 31, 2023, which\ndid not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company” as defined by the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth\ncompany can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can selectively\ndelay the adoption of all accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company\nhas elected to utilize this exemption and, as a result, the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements may not be\ncomparable to the financial statements of issuers that are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting\nstandards that are applicable to public companies. To date, however, the Company has not delayed the adoption of any accounting\nstandards. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that the Company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period at any\ntime, which election is irrevocable.\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-09,\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which is intended to improve the transparency of income tax\ndisclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the effective tax rate reconciliation and\nincome taxes paid by jurisdiction. The ASU is effective for public business entities' annual periods beginning after December 15,\n2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nPage 13\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\n3.

The proceeds of the 2022 Term Loan Facility and any additional term\nloans established in accordance with the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities may be used to finance permitted acquisitions and to pay\ntransaction fees, costs and expenses related to such acquisitions.\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are a forward looking term rate based on a secured\novernight financing rate (\"Term SOFR\") plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.625% to 3.375%, or, at the option of the\nCompany, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 1.625% to\n2.375%.\nThe 2022 Senior Credit Facilities require the Company to comply with certain affirmative, as well as certain negative covenants\nthat, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make\ninvestments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations and pay dividends and other restricted payments. The 2022 Senior\nCredit Facilities also include certain financial covenants, which generally include, but are not limited to the following:\n• Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (defined generally as total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than (i) for\nany fiscal quarter ending during the period from the closing date to and including December 31, 2024, 2.75 to 1.0 and (ii)\nfor any fiscal quarter ending on and after March 31, 2025, 2.50 to 1.0, subject to certain adjustments following a material\nacquisition.\n• Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (defined generally as (a) adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditures minus\ncash taxes to (b) the sum of scheduled principal payments plus cash interest expense plus restricted payments) of not\nless than 1.25:1.0.\nThe Company was in compliance with all covenants under the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities in effect at March 31, 2024.\nThe 2022 Senior Credit Facilities include provisions permitting the Company from time to time to, subject to certain terms and\nconditions, increase the aggregate amount of commitments under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility and/or establish one or more\nadditional term loans under the 2022 Term Loan Facility, in each case, with additional commitments from existing lenders or new\ncommitments from financial institutions acceptable to the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion; provided, that, (a) the\naggregate principal amount of any increases in the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, and (b) the aggregate principal amount of all\nadditional term loans under the 2022 Term Loan Facility established after the closing date will not exceed $30.0 million.\nFinancing costs related to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are capitalized and amortized over the term of the loans using the\neffective interest method.

Fair Value Measurement\nUnder ASC Topic 820, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (i.e., an exit price). ASC Topic 820 establishes a\nhierarchy for inputs to valuation techniques used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and\nminimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. There are three\nlevels to the hierarchy based on the reliability of inputs, as follows:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or\nsimilar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value\nis greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3.\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe Company measures certain assets at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no transfers between fair value measurement\nlevels during any presented period. The following tables summarize the Company's assets measured at fair value on a recurring\nbasis as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nAt March 31, 2024\n(In thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements:\nMoney market mutual funds $ 19 $ — $ — $ 19\nAvailable for sale debt instrument — — 2,274 2,274\nTotal $ 19 $ — $ 2,274 $ 2,293\nAt December 31, 2023\n(In thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements:\nMoney market mutual funds $ 5,657 $ — $ — $ 5,657\nAvailable for sale debt instrument — — 2,219 2,219\nTotal $ 5,657 $ — $ 2,219 $ 7,876\nAvailable for Sale Debt Instrument\nThe fair value of the Company’s available for sale debt instrument approximates its amortized cost basis due to the short maturity\nand indexed interest rate terms. The fair value is classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the Company evaluates\nadjustments using a combination of observable and unobservable inputs, such as operating results of the counterparty as well\nobservable prices in transactions of debt and equity instruments of the issuing counterparty when available. As of March 31, 2024,\nthe analysis resulted in no adjustments to the carrying value impacting unrealized gains or losses. All changes to measured fair\nvalue during the period were the result of accrued interest.\nPage 18\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nThe Company measures certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets include equity method investments,\nother equity investments, and the fair value allocation related to the Company’s acquisitions.\nEquity method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\nvalue of the investments may exceed the fair value. The Company's other equity investments are holdings in privately-held\ncompanies without a readily determinable market value. The Company remeasures equity securities without readily determinable\nfair value at fair value when an orderly transaction is identified for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer in\naccordance with the measurement alternative under Topic 820. ASU 2019-04 states that the measurement alternative is a\nnonrecurring fair value measurement. Accordingly, other equity investments without readily determinable fair value are classified\nwithin Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because the Company estimates the value using a combination of observable and\nunobservable inputs, including valuation ascribed to the issuing company in subsequent financing rounds, volatility in the results of\noperations of the issuers and rights and obligations of the holdings the Company owns. The Company had no material adjustments\nof equity method investments or other equity investments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during any of the periods\npresented.\nThe fair value allocation related to the Company’s acquisitions are determined using a discounted cash flow approach, or a\nreplacement cost approach, which are based on significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). These valuation methods required\nmanagement to make various assumptions, including, but not limited to, future profitability, cash flows, replacement costs, and\ndiscount rates. The Company’s estimates are based upon historical trends, management’s knowledge and experience and overall\neconomic factors, including projections of future earnings potential. Developing discounted future cash flows in applying the income\napproach requires the Company to evaluate its intermediate to longer-term strategies, including, but not limited to, estimates of\nrevenue growth, operating margins, capital requirements, inflation and working capital management. The development of\nappropriate rates to discount the estimated future cash flows requires the selection of risk premiums, which can materially impact\nthe present value of future cash flows.\nThe Company estimated the fair value of acquired identifiable intangible assets using discounted cash flow techniques that\nincluded an estimate of future cash flows, consistent with overall cash flow projections used to determine the purchase price paid to\nacquire the business, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows. The Company estimated the fair\nvalue of certain acquired identifiable intangible assets based on the cost approach using estimated costs consistent with historical\nexperience. The Company believes the estimates and assumptions used in the valuation methods are reasonable.\nThere were no transfers between fair value measurement levels during any presented period.\nPage 19\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\n8. Shareholders' Equity\nAuthorized Share Capital\nThe Company’s authorized share capital consists of an unlimited number of common shares, with no stated par value.\nIssued and Outstanding Share Capital\nThe Company has only one class of stock outstanding, common shares. The authorized stock consists of an unlimited number of\ncommon shares with no stated par value, of which 38,816,766 and 38,506,161 shares were issued and outstanding as of March\n31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe Company acquired and cancelled 128,362 common shares at a cost of $1.0 million to satisfy employee income tax withholding\nassociated with RSUs vesting during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The Company’s retained earnings were reduced by\nthe amount paid for the shares repurchased and cancelled.\nStock-Based Compensation\nOn June 11, 2020 (the \"Effective Date\"), the Company’s shareholders approved the Company's 2020 Long Term Incentive Plan\n(the \"Omnibus Plan\") to provide an incentive to attract, retain and reward directors, officers, employees, and consultants who\nprovide services to the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Upon approval of the Omnibus Plan, no future awards are available to\nbe made under the Company's previous RSU and Option Plans (collectively, the \"Former Plan\"), and the common shares that were\nnot settled or awarded under the Former Plan as of the Effective Date are available for awards under the Omnibus Plan. The\nmaximum number of common shares that are available for awards under the Omnibus Plan and under any other security based\ncompensation arrangements adopted by the Company, including the Former Plan, may not exceed 7,758,211 shares (equal to 20%\nof the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company on the Effective Date). The maximum amount of the foregoing\ncommon shares that may be awarded under the Omnibus Plan as “incentive stock options” is 2,600,000 common shares. As of\nMarch 31, 2024, the Company had outstanding options of 4,152,000 and RSUs of 1,524,000 associated with common shares\nunder the Omnibus Plan.\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 (in\nthousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2024 2023\nStock-based compensation - options $ 111 $ 348\nStock-based compensation - restricted stock units 1,321 1,043\nTotal $ 1,432 $ 1,391\nAt March 31, 2024, there was approximately $220,000 of total unrecognized pre-tax stock option expense under the Company's\nequity compensation plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.91 years. As of March 31,\n2024, there was approximately $8,232,000 of total unrecognized pre-tax compensation expense related to outstanding time-based\nrestricted stock units that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.95 years.\nPage 20\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\nOptions\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the three months ended March 31, 2024:\nNumber of Weighted average\noptions Weighted average remaining Aggregate\n(000's) exercise price(1) contractual life intrinsic value(2)\nBalance December 31, 2023 4,214 $ 5.25 5.9 years $ 11,698\nIssued — —\nExercised (60) 5.06\nExpired / Forfeited (2) 5.21\nBalance March 31, 2024 4,152 $ 5.25 5.6 years $ 17,423\n(1)For presentation purposes, stock options issued with a Canadian dollar exercise price have been translated to U.S. dollars based on the\nprevailing exchange rate on the date of grant.\n(2)The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding represents the difference between the exercise price of the option and the closing price of the\nCompany's common shares on the last trading day of the period ($9.43 and $7.85 on March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively).\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding was $17,423,000 and options exercisable was $16,278,000 at March 31,\n2024. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, 60,130 common shares were issued pursuant to the exercise of stock options.\nAt March 31, 2024, the Company had 3,861,000 exercisable stock options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of\n$5.23 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.5 years. At December 31, 2023, the Company had 3,461,000\nexercisable stock options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $4.99 and a weighted average remaining\ncontractual life of 5.5 years.\nThe fair value of the stock options has been charged to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive\nIncome and credited to additional paid-in capital over the vesting period, using the grant date fair value based on the Black-Scholes\noption pricing model. The assumptions used to determine the grant date fair value of stock options include exercise price, risk-free\ninterest rates, expected volatility, and average life of an option. The risk-free interest rates are based on the rates available at the\ntime of the grant for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the option’s expected life. The average life\nof an option is based on both historical and projected exercise and lapsing data. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities\nfrom traded options on the Company's common shares and historical volatility of the Company's common shares over the expected\nlife of the option. There were no issuances of options during the three months ended March 31, 2024.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe Company accounts for RSUs using fair value. The fair value of the RSUs has been charged to the Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Income and Comprehensive Income and credited to additional paid-in capital over the vesting period, based on the\nstock price on the date of grant. RSUs vest generally over a one or three-year period. The Company accounts for forfeitures of\nRSUs under ASU 2016-09 and recognizes forfeitures in the period in which they occur.\nThe following table summarizes RSU activity for the three months ended March 31, 2024:\nWeighted\nWeighted average Aggregate\nNumber of average grant remaining intrinsic\nRSUs (000's) price contractual life value(1)\nBalance December 31, 2023 1,226 $ 7.23 0.86 years $ 9,624\nIssued 750 8.39\nVested (379) 6.92\nForfeited (73) 7.93\nBalance March 31, 2024 1,524 $ 7.84 0.95 years $ 14,371\n(1)The aggregate intrinsic value of time-based RSUs outstanding was based on the closing price of the Company's common shares on the last\n.\ntrading day of the period ($9.43 and $7.85 on March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively)\nPage 21\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company issued 749,900 RSUs with equal annual vestings over a three year\nperiod and a fair value of $8.39 per share.\nPhantom Share Units\nThe Company has a phantom share unit plan, which it uses for grants to directors, officers, and employees. Phantom share units\ngranted under the plan are non-assignable and are settled in cash at vesting based on the fair value of the Company's common\nstock on the vesting date. Phantom share units vest annually over a three-year period. The cash-settled phantom share units are\naccounted for as liability awards and are re-measured at fair value each reporting period until they become vested with accrued\nliability and related expense being recognized over the requisite service period.\nThe following table summarizes phantom share unit activity for the three months ended March 31, 2024:\nNumber of phantom Value of share\nshare units (000's) equivalents(1)\nBalance December 31, 2023 418 $ 3,281\nIssued 250 2,040\nVested (128) (962)\nForfeited (5) (47)\nBalance March 31, 2024 535 $ 5,045\n(1)The value of outstanding share equivalents at the beginning of the period is based on the market price of the Company’s common shares at that\ntime, the value of issued share equivalents is based on the market price of the Company’s common shares at issuance, the value of vested share\nequivalents is based on the cash paid at the time of vesting, and the values of forfeited share equivalents and outstanding share equivalents at the\nend of the period are based on the market price of the Company's common shares at the end of the period. The market price of the Company's\ncommon shares was $9.43 and $7.85 on March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe change in fair value of the phantom share units has been charged to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and\nComprehensive Income and recorded as a liability included in accrued liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities. The total liability\nassociated with phantom share units at March 31, 2024 is $2,301,000, with $1,854,000 of this amount included in current accrued\nliabilities and the remaining portion of $447,000 included in long-term accrued liabilities.\nThe impact associated with the fair value re-measurement of phantom share units is recorded in selling, general and administrative\nexpenses within the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.

Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company accrues estimates for resolution of any legal and other contingencies when losses are probable and reasonably\nestimable in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies (“ASC 450”). No less than quarterly, the Company reviews the status of\neach significant matter underlying a legal proceeding or claim and assess our potential financial exposure. The Company accrues a\nliability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any legal proceeding or claim is considered probable and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether\nthe amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable, and accruals are based only on the information available to the Company at\nthe time the judgment is made, which may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate or unanticipated events and circumstances may\noccur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, the outcome of legal proceedings is\ninherently uncertain, and we may incur substantial defense costs and expenses defending any of these matters.\nPage 22\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\nLegal Proceedings\nAs previously disclosed, the Company (through its subsidiary Sleep Management LLC) submitted a purchase order (the “Purchase\nOrder”) in March 2020 to Vyaire Medical, Inc. d/b/a CareFusion Respiratory Technologies (“Vyaire”) for respiratory equipment. The\nCompany ultimately prepaid $1.4 million towards the delivery of such respiratory equipment. Vyaire was unable or unwilling to\ndeliver the vast majority of the respiratory equipment referenced in the Purchase Order, and also refused to refund the prepayment\namount (less the amounts paid for equipment actually received). On November 5, 2020, the Company (through its subsidiary Sleep\nManagement LLC) filed a lawsuit against Vyaire in the 15th Judicial District Court for the Parish of Lafayette, Louisiana (the “State\nCourt”) seeking damages for breach of contract and seeking a declaratory judgment that the Company is not required to pay any\nfurther funds to Vyaire. Vyaire filed a Reconventional Demand with the State Court alleging breach of contract and seeking\ndamages of $4.7 million purportedly for the improper cancellation of the Purchase Order. The State Court issued an order on\nSeptember 5, 2023 granting the Company Partial Summary Judgment finding that Vyaire breached the contract. However, the\ndetermination of damages resulting from Vyaire's breach was reserved for a non-jury trial. Vyaire has appealed the State Court's\nPartial Summary Judgment and has filed its opening brief, to which the Company has responded by filing its opposition brief.\nThe Company continues to believe that it has valid legal and equitable grounds to recover its outstanding prepayment as a result of\nVyaire’s failure to deliver the vast majority of the respiratory equipment referenced in the Purchase Order. The Company has\ndetermined that a loss related to the Reconventional Demand is not probable, and thus has not accrued a liability related to this\nclaim. Although a loss may be reasonably possible, the Company does not have sufficient information to determine the amount or\nrange of reasonably possible loss with respect to the Reconventional Demand given that the dispute is in the early stages of the\nlegal process. As of March 31, 2024, outstanding funds in the amount of $0.9 million related to undelivered respiratory equipment\nare included within other long-term assets.\nGovernmental and Regulatory Matters\nFrom time to time the Company is involved in various external governmental investigations, audits and reviews. Reviews, audits\nand investigations of this sort can lead to government actions, which can result in the assessment of recoupment of\nreimbursement, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way the Company\nconducts business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs.\n10. Income Taxes\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded income tax expense of $0.5 million, which includes a discrete\ntax benefit of $0.1 million associated with stock-based compensation arrangements. Excluding the impact of the discrete taxes, the\neffective rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 is 29.2%. The effective rate differs from the amount computed by\napplying the statutory federal and state income tax rates to ordinary income before the provision for income taxes due to\npermanent non-deductible differences. The Company's effective tax rate is based on forecasted annual results which may fluctuate\nsignificantly through the rest of the year.\nAt March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no amounts recorded for uncertain tax positions and does not expect any material\nchanges in uncertain tax benefits during the next 12 months. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax\nmatters in income tax expense. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in various states. The\nCompany is generally not subject to examination by taxing authorities for years prior to 2020.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that the Company believes that these assets are more likely than not to\nbe realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future\nreversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent\noperations.\nPage 23\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\n11. Earnings Per Share\nIncome per common share is calculated using earnings for the year divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding\nduring the year. Using the treasury stock method, diluted income per share amounts are calculated giving effect to the potential\ndilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to issue common shares were exercised or converted to common shares by\nassuming the proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs are used to purchase common shares\nat the prevailing market rate.\nThe following reflects the earnings and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2024 2023\nNumerator - basic and diluted:\nNet income attributable to shareholders $ 1,603 $ 1,517\nDenominator:\nBasic weighted average number of common shares 38,717,123 38,156,777\nDiluted weighted average number of shares 40,580,634 40,016,693\nBasic earnings per share $ 0.04 $ 0.04\nDiluted earnings per share $ 0.04 $ 0.04\nDenominator calculation from basic to diluted:\nBasic weighted average number of common shares 38,717,123 38,156,777\nStock options and other dilutive securities 1,863,511 1,859,916\nDiluted weighted average number of shares 40,580,634 40,016,693\nAnti-dilutive shares excluded from the calculation consisted of dilutive employee stock options and RSUs that were de minimis in all\nperiods presented.\nPage 24\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\nItem 2.

Some of the\ninformation in this discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Actual results\nand timing of events could differ from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the\nfollowing discussion and analysis.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements and information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the\nmeaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or \"forward-looking information\" as such term is defined in\napplicable Canadian securities legislation (collectively, \"forward-looking statements\"). Any statements other than statements of\nhistorical information, including those that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives,\nassumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking and may involve estimates,\nassumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-\nlooking statements. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof.

We believe that the assumptions and expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are\nreasonable. We cannot assure you, however, that such statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events\ncould differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-\nlooking statements.\nBy their nature, forward-looking statements involve numerous assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and\nspecific, including those identified under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the other\ndocuments we file with the SEC, including under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, and with the securities regulatory authorities in certain provinces of Canada, which contribute to the possibility\nthat the predicted outcomes may not occur or may be delayed.

As of June 30, 2020,\nwe determined that we no longer qualify as a \"foreign private issuer,\" as defined in Rule 3b-4 of the Exchange Act, for the purposes\nof the informational requirements of the Exchange Act. As a result, effective January 1, 2021, we became subject to the proxy\nsolicitation rules under Section 14 of the Exchange Act and Regulation FD, and our officers, directors, and principal shareholders\nbecame subject to the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. We will\ncontinue to file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K with the SEC and\nwith the relevant Canadian securities regulatory authorities on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval\n(SEDAR).\nWe no longer qualify as a “smaller reporting company” and are required to comply with the larger company disclosure obligations\n(subject to certain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to emerging growth companies)\nbeginning in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the JOBS Act, and as such, we have elected to comply with certain reduced\nU.S. public company reporting requirements.\nOverview\nWe provide an array of home medical equipment, services and supplies, specializing in post-acute respiratory care services in the\nUnited States. Our primary objective is to focus on the organic growth of the business and thereby solidify our position as one of\nthe United States’ largest providers of in-home therapy for patients suffering from respiratory diseases. Our respiratory care\nprograms are designed specifically for payors to have the ability to treat patients in the home for less total cost and with a superior\nquality of care. Our services include respiratory disease management (through the rental of various HME devices), neuromuscular\ncare, in-home sleep testing and sleep apnea treatment, oxygen therapy, and the sale of associated supplies.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue through the rental of non-invasive and invasive ventilators which represented 57.7% and\n63.6% of our revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We combine the benefits of home\nventilation support with licensed Respiratory Therapists (\"RTs\") to drive improved patient outcomes and reduce costly hospital\nreadmissions.\nWe expect to grow through expansion of existing service areas as well as in new territories through a cost efficient launch that\nreduces location expenses. We currently serve patients in all 50 states. We expect to continue to employ more RTs in order to\nassure our high service model is accomplished in the home. As of March 31, 2024, we employed 373 licensed RTs, representing\napproximately 36% of our company-wide employee count. By focusing overhead costs on personnel that service the patient rather\nthan physical location costs, we anticipate that we will efficiently scale our business in regions that are currently not being\neffectively serviced.\nThe continued trend of servicing patients in the home rather than in hospitals is aligned with our business objective and we\nanticipate that this trend will continue to offer growth opportunities for us. We expect to continue to be a solution to the rising health\ncosts in the United States by offering more cost effective, home based solutions while increasing the quality of life for patients\nfighting serious respiratory diseases.\nTrends Affecting our Business\nHome medical equipment markets are witnessing sustained expansion, with a notable focus on the complex respiratory and\nObstructive Sleep Apnea (\"OSA\") device segments. Analysts in the industry anticipate a consistent and robust growth trajectory,\nprojecting Compound Annual Growth Rates (\"CAGR\") of approximately 6% for respiratory devices and 8% for OSA devices. This\nupward trend underscores the increasing demand for innovative solutions in respiratory care and sleep apnea management,\nhighlighting the industry's responsiveness to evolving healthcare needs. As technological advancements and awareness drive the\nadoption of these specialized devices, we believe the HME markets, particularly in respiratory and OSA, are positioned for\ncontinuous expansion, offering promising opportunities for both providers and consumers alike.\nPage 26\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\nThe aging population remains a pivotal driver for the industry, as the elderly, constituting a substantial portion of HME patients, are\nexpected to represent a higher percentage of the overall population. Projections from industry analysts indicate a consistent annual\ngrowth in the number of Medicare beneficiaries, contributing to ongoing patient volume growth. A significant contributing factor to\nthe industry's growth is the rising incidence of chronic diseases. Factors such as increasing obesity rates, consequences of past\nsmoking prevalence, under-diagnosis of certain health conditions, and higher diagnosis rates for chronic diseases collectively\nshape the industry. There is a notable shift towards home-based treatment for these conditions.\nThe industry is undergoing a transition to value-based healthcare, with both government and commercial payors increasingly\nadopting models that emphasize the transition of patients from acute care settings to home care. We believe HME providers are\nwell-positioned to benefit from this industry shift. Advancements in technology and medical equipment have led to an increased\nprevalence of in-home treatments. The broader range of treatments administered in patient homes is expected to continue growing.\nProjections from industry analysts indicate that U.S. home healthcare spending will increase, reaching $250 billion by 2031, with a\nCAGR of approximately 7%.\nMarket consolidation is a notable trend favoring larger, financially stable players. The decline in the number of smaller regional\nplayers is attributed to the capital investment and scale required to compete effectively. This has led to a more consolidated and\ncompetitive landscape in the DME market.\nDespite these positive trends, the industry faces challenges such as cost containment efforts of payors. The consolidation of\nmanaged care payors into larger purchasing groups has increased negotiating power, resulting in pricing pressure on HME\nproviders. In addition to ongoing negotiations relating to contract management with third party payors to secure fair reimbursement,\nHME providers are engaging in value-based contracting, focusing on outcomes and patient satisfaction. These value-based\ncontracts leverage data analytics to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and quality of durable medical goods and provide\nevidence-based data to payors demonstrating the long-term benefits and cost savings associated with the use of certain medical\ngoods.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe Company faces current and potential future inflationary pressures driven by factors such as general cost increases, supply\nchain disruptions, and governmental policies. The manufacturing and distribution costs of Viemed's patient equipment are affected\nby rising material, labor, and transportation expenses, including fuel costs. Persistent inflation may impact overall demand, increase\noperating costs, and affect profit margins, potentially adversely affecting Viemed's business and financial performance.\nIn its 2024 DMEPOS Fee Schedule, CMS announced the fee schedule adjustment based on the annual change to the Consumer\nPricing Index for all urban areas. Items that were subject to the competitive bidding program in former competitive bidding areas\nwill receive a 2.9% reimbursement rate increase. Items that were subject to the competitive bidding program in non-competitive\nbidding areas received a 3.0% reimbursement rate increase. Items not subject to the competitive bidding program received a 2.6%\nreimbursement rate increase.\nFuture volatility in general price inflation and its impact on material availability, shipping, warehousing, and operational overhead\ncould further impact financial results. Viemed attempts to address these pressures through its inflation-linked reimbursement\ncontracts, negotiation, leveraging its purchasing power and embracing technology, such as its proprietary clinical management\nplatform.\nPage 27\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\nThe below table highlights summary financial and operational metrics for the last eight quarters.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except vent patients)\nMarch 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30,\nFor the quarter ended 2024 2023 2023 2023 2023 2022 2022 2022\nFinancial Information:\nRevenue $ 50,593 $ 50,739 $ 49,402 $ 43,311 $ 39,556 $ 37,508 $ 35,759 $ 33,310\nGross Profit 29,802 32,111 30,562 26,106 24,004 22,896 21,651 20,390\nGross Profit % 59 % 63 % 62 % 60 % 61 % 61 % 61 % 61 %\nNet Income 1,603 3,477 2,919 2,330 1,517 2,438 1,055 967\nCash (As of) 7,309 12,839 10,078 10,224 23,544 16,914 21,478 21,922\nTotal Assets (As of) 154,875 154,895 149,400 149,117 124,634 117,043 119,419 115,904\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) 10,098 12,845 12,081 9,810 8,328 9,306 6,982 6,458\nOperational Information:\nVent Patients(2) 10,450 10,327 10,244 10,005 9,337 9,306 9,127 8,837\n(1) Refer to \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section below for definition of Adjusted EBITDA.\n(2) Vent Patients represents the number of active ventilator patients on recurring billing service at the end of each calendar quarter.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n% of Total % of Total $ %\n2024 Revenue 2023 Revenue Change Change\nRevenue $ 50,593 100.0 % $ 39,556 100.0 % $ 11,037 27.9 %\nCost of revenue 20,791 41.1 % 15,552 39.3 % 5,239 33.7 %\nGross profit 29,802 58.9 % 24,004 60.7 % 5,798 24.2 %\nSelling, general and administrative 24,814 49.0 % 19,762 50.0 % 5,052 25.6 %\nResearch and development 750 1.5 % 780 2.0 % (30) (3.8) %\nStock-based compensation 1,432 2.8 % 1,391 3.5 % 41 2.9 %\nDepreciation and amortization 415 0.8 % 240 0.6 % 175 72.9 %\nLoss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment 213 0.4 % (22) (0.1) % 235 (1068.2) %\nOther income, net (26) (0.1) % (81) (0.2) % 55 (67.9) %\nIncome from operations 2,204 4.4 % 1,934 4.9 % 270 14.0 %\nNon-operating income and expenses\nIncome from equity method investments (67) (0.1) % (35) (0.1) % (32) 91.4 %\nInterest expense (income), net 150 0.3 % (49) (0.1) % 199 (406.1) %\nNet income before taxes 2,121 4.2 % 2,018 5.1 % 103 5.1 %\nProvision for income taxes 518 1.0 % 501 1.3 % 17 3.4 %\nNet income $ 1,603 3.2 % $ 1,517 3.8 % $ 86 5.7 %\nPage 28\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\nRevenue\nThe following table summarizes our revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n% of Total % of Total $ %\n2024 Revenue 2023 Revenue Change Change\nNet revenue from rentals\nVentilator rentals, non-invasive and invasive $ 29,187 57.7 % $ 25,147 63.6 % $ 4,040 16.1 %\nOther home medical equipment rentals 10,934 21.6 % 6,906 17.5 % 4,028 58.3 %\nNet revenue from sales and services\nEquipment and supply sales 6,138 12.1 % 4,764 12.0 % 1,374 28.8 %\nService revenues 4,334 8.6 % 2,739 6.9 % 1,595 58.2 %\nTotal net revenue $ 50,593 100.0 % $ 39,556 100.0 % $ 11,037 27.9 %\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, revenue totaled $50.6 million, an increase of $11.0 million (or 27.9%) from the\ncomparable period in 2023. The net revenue increase was comprised of increases in ventilator rental revenue of $4.0 million (or\n16.1%), rental revenue from other HME of $4.0 million (or 58.3%), equipment and supply sales of $1.4 million (or 28.8%), and\nservice revenues of $1.6 million (or 58.2%). The growth in other home medical equipment rentals has been primarily driven by the\ncontinued national expansion of PAP, oxygen therapy, and percussion vest activities and the acquisition of HMP. The increase in\nequipment sales and supplies is primarily driven by the success of our PAP resupply program and other sleep offerings.\nThe increase in service revenue is primarily due to the addition of our healthcare staffing offerings. While ventilator rentals continue\nto make up the majority of our revenue, the organic and acquired growth of PAP and oxygen related sales and services, as well as\nour healthcare staffing offerings, is contributing significantly to the diversity of our overall revenue mix. As we continue to expand\ngeographically into new territories and further expand our presence in our existing territories, we expect continued growth in our\nactive ventilator patient base and our other respiratory offerings.\nCost of revenue and gross profit\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, cost of revenue totaled $20.8 million, an increase of $5.2 million (or 33.7%) from the\ncomparable period in 2023. Gross profit percentage decreased from approximately 60.7% in the three months ended March 31,\n2023 to approximately 58.9% in the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease in gross profit percentage is primarily due\nto migration of the revenue mix associated with product and service diversification. Gross profit percentage is expected to remain\nrelatively stable in upcoming periods due to subsiding inflationary cost pressures and the positive effects associated with\nreimbursement rates, offset by some decreases associated with product and service diversification.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 49.0% for the three months ended March\n31, 2024 compared to 50.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled\n$24.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, an increase of $5.1 million (or 25.6%) from the comparable period in\n2023. The overall increase in selling, general and administrative expense as compared to the prior period is primarily due to\nadditional employee related expenses to accommodate the overall growth of the Company. Our full time employee count increased\nfrom 765 on March 31, 2023 to 1,030 on March 31, 2024, an increase of 35%, which was partially due to the acquisition of HMP on\nJune 1, 2023. Employee compensation expenses increased $3.4 million (or 24%) as a result of the increase in our employee\nheadcount and increases in incentive and volume based compensation. We expect that current year selling, general and\nadministrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will continue to improve through the end of 2024 due to increased efficiencies\nand costs stabilization relative to revenue growth.\nResearch and development\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, research and development expense totaled $0.8 million. As we\ncontinue to invest in research and development related projects to support our technology initiatives, we expect that the associated\ncosts will remain consistent in 2024 relative to 2023 costs.\nPage 29\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\nStock-based compensation\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, stock-based compensation totaled $1.4 million, an increase of 2.9% from the\ncomparable period in 2023. We anticipate that as we expand our workforce, incorporating stock-based awards as a component of\nemployee compensation, stock-based compensation expenses will correspondingly rise. Historically, revenue growth has outpaced\nthe growth in stock-based compensation, and as a result, the percentage of stock-based compensation relative to revenue is\nexpected to continue declining.\nProvision for income taxes\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, the provision for income taxes was $0.5 million. Excluding\ndiscrete items, our annual estimated effective tax rate for 2024 is 29.2%.\nNet income\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, net income was $1.6 million, an increase of $0.1 million (or 5.7%) from the\ncomparable period in 2023. Net income as a percentage of net revenue decreased slightly from 3.8% for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2023 to 3.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\nPage 30\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company uses Adjusted EBITDA, which is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") to analyze its financial results and believes that it is useful to investors, as a\nsupplement to GAAP measures. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information with respect to the\nCompany’s operating performance as viewed by management, including a view of the Company’s business that is not dependent\non the impact of the Company’s capitalization structure and items that are not part of the Company’s day-to-day operations.\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA (i) to compare the Company’s operating performance on a consistent basis, (ii) to calculate\nincentive compensation for the Company’s employees, (iii) for planning purposes, including the preparation of the Company’s\ninternal annual operating budget, and (iv) to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the Company’s operational strategies.\nAccordingly, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in understanding and evaluating the\nCompany’s operating performance in the same manner as management. In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, certain items (mostly\nnon-cash) are excluded from net income including net interest expense (income), taxes, stock based compensation, depreciation of\nproperty and equipment, and amortization of intangible assets. Beginning with financial results reported for periods in fiscal year\n2023, Adjusted EBITDA also excludes transaction costs and expenses related to acquisition and integration efforts associated with\nrecently announced or completed acquisitions. This modification enables investors to compare period-over-period results on a\nmore consistent basis without the effects of acquisitions. We have recast Adjusted EBITDA for prior periods when reported to\nconform to the modified presentation.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of Net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, on a\nhistorical basis for the periods indicated:\nMarch 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30,\nFor the quarter ended 2024 2023 2023 2023 2023 2022 2022 2022\nNet Income $ 1,603 $ 3,477 $ 2,919 $ 2,330 $ 1,517 $ 2,438 $ 1,055 $ 967\nAdd back:\nDepreciation & amortization 6,285 5,918 5,975 5,207 4,762 4,373 4,120 3,740\nInterest expense (income) 150 256 237 (20) (49) 32 42 59\nStock-based compensation(a) 1,432 1,534 1,453 1,471 1,391 1,317 1,309 1,271\nTransaction costs(b) 110 61 177 94 206 — — —\nIncome tax expense 518 1,599 1,320 728 501 1,146 456 421\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 10,098 $ 12,845 $ 12,081 $ 9,810 $ 8,328 $ 9,306 $ 6,982 $ 6,458\n(a) Represents non-cash, equity-based compensation expense associated with option and RSU awards.\n(b) Represents transaction costs and expenses related to acquisition and integration efforts associated with recently announced or\ncompleted acquisitions.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in\naccordance with GAAP. It is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an\nalternative to revenue or net income, as applicable, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an\nalternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of the Company's liquidity, and may not be comparable to other\nsimilarly titled measures of other companies or businesses. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not\nbe considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA does\nnot reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of ongoing operations; and\nother companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative\nmeasure.\nPage 31\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2024 was $7.3 million, compared to $12.8 million at December 31, 2023. Typically, our\nprincipal source of liquidity is the collection of our patient accounts receivable. In addition to our collection of patient accounts\nreceivable, from time to time, we can and do obtain additional sources of liquidity by the incurrence of additional indebtedness.\nBased on our current plan of operations, we believe cash and cash equivalents, when combined with expected cash flows from\noperations and amounts available under our 2022 Senior Credit Facilities will be sufficient to fund our growth strategy and to meet\nour anticipated operating expenses, capital expenditures, and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months from the date\nof this filing. The Company has also historically utilized short term financing arrangements with suppliers that could be extended\nover a longer term if there was a need for additional liquidity.\nThe Company uses Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, to submit patient claims to certain non-Medicare\npayors for reimbursement. UnitedHealth Group announced that on February 21, 2024, Change Healthcare’s information technology\nsystems were impacted by a cybersecurity incident. While the incident did not impact our day-to-day operations or the delivery of\npatient care, submissions of patient claims to certain payors were delayed. As of the end of the first quarter of 2024, the Company\nhas resumed claims submission to several affected payors and utilized alternative platforms for the majority of its claims. However,\nthe delayed claims submissions resulted in a reduction of our operating cash flow and an increase to our accounts receivable\nduring the three months ended March 31, 2024.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2024 2023\nNet Cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 1,175 $ 10,496\nInvesting activities (5,365) (3,905)\nFinancing activities (1,340) 39\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (5,530) $ 6,630\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $1.2 million, resulting from net\nincome of $1.6 million, increased by net income adjustments of $7.9 million and offset by an increase in non-cash working capital\nof $8.3 million. The net income adjustments primarily consisted of $6.3 million of depreciation and amortization and $1.4 million of\nstock-based compensation. The primary changes in non-cash working capital were an increase in net accounts receivable of $6.0\nmillion and a decrease in accrued liabilities of $3.6 million, partially offset by an increase in trade payables of $0.6 million. The\nincrease in accounts receivable was primarily driven by the cybersecurity incident at Change Healthcare, which resulted in delays\nto submissions of patient claims to certain payors.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $10.5 million, resulting from net\nincome of $1.5 million, increased by net income adjustments of $5.5 million and a decrease in non-cash working capital of $3.5\nmillion. The net income adjustments primarily consisted of $4.8 million of depreciation and amortization and $1.4 million of stock-\nbased compensation. The primary changes in working capital were an increase in accrued liabilities of $1.8 million and an increase\nin income taxes payable of $1.3 million, partially offset by an increase in net accounts receivable of $0.9 million.\nPage 32\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $5.4 million, consisting of $6.0 million of\npurchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $0.6 million of sales proceeds from the disposal of property and\nequipment.

The proceeds of the 2022 Term Loan Facility and any additional term\nloans established in accordance with the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities may be used to finance permitted acquisitions and to pay\ntransaction fees, costs and expenses related to such acquisitions. Outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Term Loan Facility and\n2022 Revolving Credit Facility were $4.8 million and $2.0 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2024.\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are Term SOFR plus an applicable margin, which\nranges from 2.625% to 3.375%, or, at the option of the Company, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities) plus\nan applicable margin, which ranges from 1.625% to 2.375%.\nThe 2022 Senior Credit Facilities require the Company to comply with certain affirmative, as well as certain negative covenants\nthat, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make\ninvestments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations and pay dividends and other restricted payments. The 2022 Senior\nCredit Facilities also include certain financial covenants, which generally include, but are not limited to the following:\n• Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (defined generally as total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than (i) for\nany fiscal quarter ending during the period from the closing date to and including December 31, 2024, 2.75 to 1.0 and (ii)\nfor any fiscal quarter ending on and after March 31, 2025, 2.50 to 1.0, subject to certain adjustments following a material\nacquisition.\n• Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (defined generally as (a) adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditures minus\ncash taxes to (b) the sum of scheduled principal payments plus cash interest expense plus restricted payments) of not\nless than 1.25:1.0.\nThe Company was in compliance with all covenants under the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities in effect at March 31, 2024.\nPage 33\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\nSources of Funds\nCash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $1.2 million compared to $10.5 million\nduring the three months ended March 31, 2023.\nUse of Funds\nOur principal uses of cash are funding the purchase of rental assets and other capital purchases, the repayment of debt, funding of\nacquisitions, operations, and other working capital requirements. Our contractual obligations primarily relate to the repayment of\nexisting debt and contractual obligations for operating and finance leases. The following table presents our material contractual\nobligations and commitments to make future payments as of March 31, 2024:\nWithin 12 Months Beyond 12 Months\nDebt Obligations, including interest $ 1,131 $ 7,668\nLease Obligations 1,116 2,436\nTotal $ 2,247 $ 10,104\nExcept for the funding of potential acquisitions and investments, we anticipate that our operating cash flows will satisfy our material\ncash requirements for the 12 months after March 31, 2024. In addition to our operating cash flows, we may need to raise additional\nfunds to support our contractual obligations and investing activities beyond such 12 month period, and such funding may not be\navailable to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, our operations and ability to\nexecute our business strategy could be adversely affected. We may seek to raise additional funds through equity, equity-linked or\ndebt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness would have rights that are\nsenior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. Any additional equity financing\nmay be dilutive to our stockholders.\nLeases\nLeases under which we assume substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon initial\nrecognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lesser of its fair value and the present value of the minimum\nlease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to\nthe asset. The associated lease liability is drawn down over the life of the lease by allocating a portion of each lease payment to the\nliability with the remainder being recognized as finance charges. Leases that do not transfer the risks and rewards of ownership to\nthe Company are treated as operating leases and are expensed as incurred.\nRetirement Plan\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) retirement plan for employees to which eligible employees can contribute a percentage of their\npre-tax compensation. Matching employer contributions to the 401(k) plan totaled $535,000 and $409,000 for the three months\nended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOff balance sheet arrangements\nThe Company has no material undisclosed off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or\nfuture effect on its results of operations or financial condition.\nAccounting and Disclosure Matters\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe are required to disclose “critical accounting estimates” which are estimates made in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and that have had or are reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe follow financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States. The more significant of these policies are summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in\nPage 34\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\nPart II, Item 8 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Not all significant accounting\npolicies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments. However, the policy noted below could be deemed\nto meet the SEC’s definition of a critical accounting estimate.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are presented at net realizable values that reflect the consideration we expect to receive which is inclusive of\nadjustments for price concessions. Due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate,\ncertain estimates are required in order to record revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Management’s\nevaluation takes into consideration such factors as historical realization data, including current and historical cash collections,\naccounts receivable aging trends, other operating trends and relevant business conditions.\nInherent in these estimates is the risk that they may have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. It\nis possible that management’s estimates could change, which could have an impact on operations and cash flows. Specifically, the\ncomplexity of many third-party billing arrangements, patient qualification for medical necessity of equipment and the uncertainty of\nreimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. If the\npayment amount received differs from the estimated net realizable amount, an adjustment is made to the net realizable amount in\nthe period that these payment differences are determined.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of\nrecently issued accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of\noperations, financial positions and cash flows.\nPage 35\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOur exposure to market risk primarily relates to fluctuations in interest rates from borrowings under the 2022 Senior Credit\nFacilities. The interest rates per annum applicable to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are Term SOFR plus an applicable margin,\nwhich ranges from 2.625% to 3.375%, or, at the option of the Company, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2022 Senior Credit\nFacilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 1.625% to 2.375%. Outstanding borrowings subject to interest rate\nfluctuations under the 2022 Term Loan Facility and 2022 Revolving Credit Facility were $4.8 million and $2.0 million, respectively,\nas of March 31, 2024. Based on our outstanding borrowings, an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have\na material effect on our net income.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to\nRule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded:\ni. that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure (a) that information required to be\ndisclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized\nand reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and (b) that such information is accumulated\nand communicated to the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as\nappropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and\nii. that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that the Company's disclosures controls and procedures will detect or\nuncover all failures of persons within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries to disclose material information otherwise\nrequired to be set forth in the Company's periodic reports. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of\ndisclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and\nprocedures.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended March 31,\n2024 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial\nreporting.\nPage 36\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMarch 31, 2024 and 2023\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to various ongoing or threatened legal actions and other proceedings, including those that\narise in the ordinary course of business, which may include employment matters, breach of contract disputes, as well as\ngovernmental and regulatory matters. Please read Note 9—Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information.

There have been no material changes in\nour risk factors from those disclosed in that Annual Report.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nNone.\nCompany Repurchases of Equity Securities\nNone.\nDividends\nWe have not declared or paid any cash or stock dividends on our common shares since our inception. Any future determination as\nto the declaration and payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend on then-existing conditions,\nincluding our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and other\nfactors that the Board considers relevant.

Any statements other than statements of\nhistorical information, including those that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives,\nassumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking and may involve estimates,\nassumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-\nlooking statements. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly\nupdate or revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events\nor otherwise, except as required by applicable law.\nForward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance and reflect the expectations or beliefs of management\nregarding future events, and include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: operating results; profitability; financial\ncondition and resources; anticipated needs for working capital; liquidity; capital resources; capital expenditures; milestones;\nlicensing milestones; information with respect to future growth and growth strategies; anticipated trends in our industry; our future\nfinancing plans; timelines; currency fluctuations; government regulation; unanticipated expenses; commercial disputes or claims;\nlimitations on insurance coverage or other reimbursement; and availability of cash flow to fund capital requirements.\nOften, but not always, forward-looking information can be identified by the use of words such as “plans”, “expects”, “is expected”,\n“budget”, “potential”, “scheduled”, “estimates”, “forecasts”, “intends”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “projects”, or the negatives thereof or\nvariations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results “will”, “should”, “may”, “could”, “would”,\n“might” or “will be taken”, “occur” or “be achieved” or the negative of these terms or comparable terminology.\nForward-looking statements are based on the reasonable assumptions, estimates, analysis and opinions of management made in\nlight of its experience and its perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments, as well as other factors that\nmanagement believes to be relevant and reasonable in the circumstances at the date that such statements are made, but which\nmay prove to be incorrect. We believe that the assumptions and expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are\nreasonable. We cannot assure you, however, that such statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events\ncould differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-\nlooking statements.\nBy their nature, forward-looking statements involve numerous assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and\nspecific, including those identified under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other\ndocuments we file with the SEC and with the securities regulatory authorities in certain provinces of Canada, which contribute to\nthe possibility that the predicted outcomes may not occur or may be delayed. The risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of\nwhich are beyond our control, that could influence actual results include, but are not limited to: the general business, market and\neconomic conditions in the regions in which the we operate; significant capital requirements and operating risks that we may be\nsubject to; our ability to implement business strategies and pursue business opportunities; volatility in the market price of our\ncommon shares; the state of the capital markets; the availability of funds and resources to pursue operations; inflation; reductions\nin reimbursement rates and audits of reimbursement claims by various governmental and private payor entities; dependence on\nfew payors; possible new drug discoveries; dependence on key suppliers; granting of permits and licenses in a highly regulated\nbusiness; competition; disruptions in or attacks (including cyber-attacks) on our information technology, internet, network access or\nother voice or data communications systems or services; the evolution of various types of fraud or other criminal behavior to which\nwe are exposed; difficulty integrating newly acquired businesses; the impact of new and changes to, or application of, current laws\nand regulations; the overall difficult litigation and regulatory environment; increased competition; increased funding costs and\nmarket volatility due to market illiquidity and competition for funding; critical accounting estimates and changes to accounting\nstandards, policies, and methods used by us; our status as an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company; and\nthe occurrence of natural and unnatural catastrophic events or health epidemics or concerns, and claims resulting from such\nevents or concerns, as well as other general economic, market and business conditions; and other factors beyond our control.\nCURRENCY\nReferences in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “$”, “US$” or “U.S. dollars” are to United States dollars. All dollar amounts herein\nare in United States dollars.\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nPART I\nItem 1. Business\nCompany Overview\nViemed Healthcare, Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"Viemed\"), through its subsidiaries, is a provider of home medical equipment (\"HME\")\nand post-acute respiratory healthcare services in the United States. The Company’s service offerings are focused on effective in-\nhome treatment with clinical practitioners providing therapy and counseling to patients in their homes using cutting edge\ntechnologies. The Company currently serves patients in all 50 states of the United States.\nViemed’s primary objective is to focus on the growth of its business and thereby solidify its position as one of the largest providers\nof home therapy for patients suffering from respiratory diseases that require a high level of service, with such programs being\ndesigned specifically for payors to have the ability to treat patients in the home for less total cost and with a superior quality of care.\nViemed's services include respiratory disease management, neuromuscular care, in-home sleep testing and sleep apnea\ntreatment, oxygen therapy, respiratory equipment rentals, and healthcare staffing services.\nViemed expects to use a growth model whereby expansion is effectuated through existing service areas as well as in new regions\nthrough a cost efficient launch that reduces location expenses. Viemed expects that it will continue to employ more respiratory\ntherapists (\"RTs\") in order to assure the high service model is accomplished in the home. By focusing overhead costs to personnel\nthat service the patient rather than physical location costs, Viemed anticipates continuing to efficiently scale its business in regions\nthat are currently not being effectively serviced.\nThe continued trend of servicing patients in the home rather than in hospitals is aligned with Viemed’s business objectives and\nmanagement anticipates that this trend will continue to offer growth opportunities for the Company. Viemed expects to continue to\nbe a solution to the rising healthcare costs in the United States by offering more cost effective home based solutions while\nincreasing the quality of life for patients fighting serious respiratory diseases.\nViemed focuses on disease management and improving the quality of life for respiratory patients through clinical excellence,\neducation and technology. Its service offerings are based on effective home treatment with respiratory care practitioners providing\ntherapy and counseling to patients in their homes using cutting edge technologies. Viemed also provides in-home sleep testing for\nsleep apnea sufferers and health care staffing services for healthcare facilities.\nViemed is one of the largest independent non-invasive ventilator providers in the United States with a service coverage area of all\n50 states of the United States and intends to continue to grow rapidly through increased market penetration.\nCorporate Information\nViemed Healthcare, Inc. is a holding company incorporated in British Columbia under the Business Corporations Act in December\n2016.

Revenue derived from the rental and sale of home medical equipment represented a combined 94.2%\nand 93.8%, respectively, of Viemed’s 2023 and 2022 traditional revenue, excluding COVID-19 response sales and\nservices. Viemed provides home medical equipment through the following service programs:\n◦ Respiratory disease management, including treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (“COPD”),\naims to improve quality of life and reduce hospital readmissions by using proven methodology and leading\ntechnologies, such as non-invasive ventilation (“NIV”), percussion vests, and other therapies. Viemed provides\nventilation (both invasive and non-invasive) and related equipment and supplies to patients suffering from COPD\nthrough a high-touch model.\n◦ Neuromuscular care is focused on helping neuromuscular patients breathe more comfortably while living an\nactive, healthier life and uses respiratory therapy treatments which can lessen the effort required to breathe.\n◦ Oxygen therapy provides patients with extra oxygen, which is sometimes used to manage certain chronic health\nproblems, including COPD. Oxygen therapy may be performed in the home or in another setting.\n◦ Sleep apnea management provides sleep solutions and/or equipment such as Positive Airway Pressure (“PAP”),\nthe AutoPAP (automatic continuous positive airway pressure), and BiPAP machines.\n• In-home sleep testing: Viemed provides in home sleep apnea testing services, which is an alternative to the traditional\nsleep lab testing environment.\n• Healthcare staffing: Viemed provides healthcare staffing and recruitment services to supplement the workforce needs of\nthird party healthcare facilities by utilizing its network of healthcare professionals.\nMonthly rental revenue from ventilators represented approximately 59% and 68%, respectively, of Viemed's 2023 and 2022\ntraditional revenue, excluding COVID-19 response sales and services. While Viemed plans to continue investigating and\nintroducing new complementary products and services and further expanding the coverage of existing products, home ventilation\n(both invasive and non-invasive) is expected to continue to represent the substantial majority of Viemed’s revenue.\nPatients suffering from neuromuscular or respiratory diseases experience severe difficulty in breathing and require assistance from\na ventilator to effectively move air in and out of their lungs. Invasive and non-invasive ventilation differ in how the air is delivered to\nthe person. Invasive ventilation delivers air via a tube inserted into the windpipe. Non-invasive ventilation delivers air through a\nsealed mask that can be placed over the mouth.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual stipulates that\nventilators are covered for the treatment of conditions associated with neuromuscular diseases, thoracic restrictive diseases, and\nchronic respiratory failure consequent to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Ventilators are also included in Medicare’s\nFrequently & Substantially Serviced payment category and are reimbursed under the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding\nSystem (“HCPCS”) codes E0465 (invasive ventilation), E0466 (non-invasive ventilation) and E0467 (multi-function ventilation).\nViemed’s patients are served by RTs who are each licensed members of the American Association for Respiratory Care (“AARC”).\nThe RT licensure and AARC membership ensure that Viemed is able to provide patients with in-home respiratory care services,\nequipment setup, training, and on-call services with state-of-the-art clinical protocols. Additionally, Viemed’s Chief Medical Officer,\nDr. William Frazier, is a board certified pulmonary disease specialist and oversees clinical protocols.\nViemed sources hardware from vendors and pairs them with industry leading respiratory therapy. The emerging nature of the\nmarket presents risks that vendors may not be able to provide equipment to satisfy demand. Viemed has historically funded patient\nrelated capital expenditures through cash generated from operations or financing through an affiliate of its primary vendors.\nAdditionally, Viemed patient related capital expenditures can be financed through its existing commercial credit facilities comprised\nof a revolving credit facility of up to $30.0 million, a delayed draw term loan facility of up to $30 million, and an accordion feature\nallowing the Company to increase the size of such facilities by up to an additional $30 million, subject to certain conditions, for a\ntotal borrowing capacity of up to $90 million.\nPage 6\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation, including numerous laws directed at regulating reimbursement of our products\nand services under various government and commercial programs and preventing fraud and abuse, as more fully described below.\nWe maintain certain safeguards intended to reduce the likelihood that we will engage in conduct or enter into arrangements in\nviolation of these restrictions. Federal and state laws require that we obtain facility and other regulatory licenses and that we enroll\nas a supplier with federal and state health programs. Notwithstanding these measures, due to changes in and new interpretations\nof such laws and regulations, and changes in our business, among other factors, violations of these laws and regulations may still\noccur, which could subject us to: civil and criminal enforcement actions; licensure revocation, suspension, or non-renewal; severe\nfines and penalties; and even the termination of our ability to provide services, including those provided under certain government\nprograms such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services\nCMS requires providers of products or services to attain and maintain accreditation in order to participate in federally funded\nhealthcare programs. To attain and maintain accreditation, companies are required to institute policies and procedures that, among\nother things, formalize the interaction of the company with patients. Accrediting bodies that are approved by CMS will perform\naudits of these policies and procedures every three years. Should a company fall out of compliance with the requirements of the\naccrediting body, expulsion from the Medicare program could follow. In December 2008, we became a Durable, Medical\nEquipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies accredited Medicare supplier by the Accreditation Commission for Health Care for\nour solutions. Our Medicare accreditation must be renewed every three years through passage of an on-site inspection. We last\nrenewed our accreditation with Medicare in August 2021. Maintaining our accreditation and Medicare enrollment requires that we\ncomply with numerous business and customer support standards. If we are found to be out of compliance with accreditation\nstandards, our enrollment status in the Medicare program could be jeopardized, up to and including termination.\nCMS also requires that all durable medical equipment (\"DME\") providers who bill the Medicare program maintain a surety bond of\n$50,000 per National Provider Identifier (“NPI”) number which Medicare has approved for billing privileges. We obtained surety\nbonds before the October 2009 deadline, and such bonds automatically renew annually.\nIn order to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries only receive medically necessary and appropriate items and services, the Medicare\nprogram has adopted a number of documentation requirements. For example, the DME Medicare Administrative Contractor\n(“MAC”) Supplier Manuals provide that clinical information from the “patient’s medical record” is required to justify the initial and\nongoing medical necessity for the provision of DME. Some DME MACs, CMS staff and government subcontractors have taken the\nposition, among other things, that the “patient’s medical record” refers not to documentation maintained by the DME supplier but\ninstead to documentation maintained by the patient’s physician, healthcare facility or other clinician, and that clinical information\ncreated by the DME supplier’s personnel and confirmed by the patient’s physician is not sufficient to establish medical necessity. It\nmay be difficult, and sometimes impossible, for us to obtain documentation from other healthcare providers. Moreover, auditors’\ninterpretations of these policies are inconsistent and subject to individual interpretation. This is then translated to individual supplier\nerror rates and aggregated into a Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (“DMEPOS”) industry error rate,\nwhich is significantly higher than other Medicare provider/supplier types. High error rates lead to further audit activity and regulatory\nburdens. DME MACs continue to conduct extensive pre-payment and post-payment reviews across the DME industry and have\ndetermined a wide range of error rates. DME MACs have repeatedly cited documentation insufficiencies as the primary reason for\nclaim denials. If these or other burdensome positions are generally adopted by auditors, DME MACs, other contractors or CMS in\nadministering the Medicare program, we would have the right to challenge these positions as being contrary to law. If these\ninterpretations of the documentation requirements are ultimately upheld, however, it could result in our making significant refunds\nand other payments to Medicare and our future revenues from Medicare may be significantly reduced. We have adjusted certain\noperational policies to address the current expectations of Medicare and its contractors. We cannot predict the adverse impact, if\nany, these interpretations of the Medicare documentation requirements or our revised policies might have on our operations, cash\nflow, and capital resources, but such impact could be material.\nCMS maintains a Master List of Items Frequently Subject to Unnecessary Utilization. This list identifies items that could potentially\nbe subject to prior authorization as a condition of Medicare payment. CMS has added home ventilators used with a non-invasive\ninterface to the Master List of Items Frequently Subject to Unnecessary Utilization. If CMS requires prior authorization requirements\nfor noninvasive home ventilation, it could materially impact our business.\nPage 7\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nCompetitive Bidding Process\nThe Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 required the Secretary of Health and Human\nServices (\"HHS\") to establish and implement programs under which competitive acquisition areas are established throughout the\nUnited States for purposes of awarding contracts for the furnishing of competitively priced items of durable medical equipment.\nCMS conducts a competition for each competitive acquisition area under which providers submit bids to supply certain covered\nitems of DME. Under the competitive bidding program, DME suppliers compete to become Medicare contract suppliers by\nsubmitting bids to furnish certain items in competitive bidding areas. As part of the competitive bidding process, single payment\namounts (“SPAs”) replace the current Medicare DME fee schedule payment amounts for selected items in certain areas of the\ncountry. The SPAs are determined by using bids submitted by DME suppliers. In 2019, CMS included non-invasive ventilator\nproducts on the list of products subject to the competitive bidding program in Round 2021. On March 9, 2020, CMS announced that\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States President's exercise of the Defense Production Act, public concern regarding\naccess to ventilators, and the non-invasive ventilators product category being new to the competitive bidding program, non-invasive\nventilators were removed as a product category from Round 2021. On October 27, 2020, CMS announced that it had removed 13\nof the 15 remaining product categories from Round 2021, including oxygen and PAP devices, because the payment amounts did\nnot achieve expected savings. As a result of these announcements, we retain the ability to continue to furnish non-invasive\nventilators and oxygen and PAP devices for all of our Medicare accredited areas. However, we are uncertain if non-invasive\nventilators and oxygen and PAP devices will be included in future competitive bidding programs. The current Round 2021 contracts\nexpired on December 31, 2023 and CMS has not announced a new round of competitive bidding. Historically, CMS announces\nnew rounds of competitive bidding and starts the process approximately 18 months prior to the contract start date. We cannot\npredict the outcome of the competitive bidding process for contracted supplier selection or the impact of the competitive bidding\nprocess on reimbursements to our existing customers.\nLicensure\nSeveral states require that DME providers be licensed in order to sell products to patients in that state. Certain of these states\nrequire that durable medical equipment providers maintain an in-state location. Most of our state licenses are renewed on an\nannual basis. Although we believe we are in compliance with all applicable state regulations regarding licensure requirements, if we\nwere found to be noncompliant, we could lose our licensure in that state, which could prohibit us from selling our current or future\nproducts to patients in that state. In addition, we are subject to certain state laws regarding professional licensure.\nAccreditation\nMany payors require accreditation under payor contracts. If we lose accreditation at any location, it could have an adverse impact\non our reimbursement under payor contracts.\nFraud and Abuse Regulations\nFederal Anti-Kickback and Self-Referral Laws. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, among other things, prohibits the knowing\nand willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration, whether directly or indirectly and overtly or covertly, in\nreturn for, or to induce the referral of an individual for the:\n• furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable in whole or in part under Medicare, Medicaid or\nother federal healthcare programs; or\n• purchase, lease, or order of, or the arrangement or recommendation of the purchasing, leasing, or ordering of any item or\nservice reimbursable in whole or in part under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs.\nThere are a number of narrow safe harbors to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Such safe harbors permit certain payments and\nbusiness practices that, although they would otherwise potentially implicate the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, are not treated as an\noffense under the same if all of the requirements of the specific applicable safe harbor are met.\nThe Federal Anti-Kickback Statute applies to certain arrangements with healthcare providers, product end users and other parties,\nincluding marketing arrangements and discounts and other financial incentives offered in connection with the sales of our products.\nAlthough we believe that we have structured such arrangements to be in compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute and other\napplicable laws, regulatory authorities may determine that our marketing, pricing, or other activities violate the Federal Anti-\nKickback Statute or other applicable laws. Noncompliance with the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in civil, administrative\nand/or criminal penalties, restrictions on our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions, and exclusion from participation in Medicare,\nMedicaid or other federal healthcare programs. In addition, to the extent we are found to not be in compliance, we may be required\nto curtail or restructure our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, exclusions, curtailment or restructuring of our operations\ncould adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nPage 8\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe Ethics in Patient Referrals Act, commonly known as the “Stark Law,” prohibits a physician from making referrals for certain\n“designated health services” payable by Medicare to an entity, including a company that furnishes DME, in which the physician or\nan immediate family member of such physician has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician has entered\ninto a compensation arrangement, unless a statutory exception applies. Violation of the Stark Law could result in denial of\npayment, disgorgement of reimbursements received under a noncompliance arrangement, civil penalties, damages and exclusion\nfrom Medicare or other governmental programs. Although we believe that we have structured our provider arrangements to comply\nwith current Stark Law requirements, these requirements are highly technical and there can be no guarantee that regulatory\nauthorities will not determine or assert that our arrangements are in violation of the Stark Law and do not otherwise meet applicable\nStark Law exceptions.\nAdditionally, because some of these laws continue to evolve, we lack definitive guidance as to the application of certain key\naspects of these laws as they relate to our arrangements with providers with respect to patient training. We cannot predict the final\nform that these regulations will take or the effect that the final regulations will have on us. As a result, our provider arrangements\nmay ultimately be found to be noncompliant with applicable federal law.\nFalse statements. The federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or omitting a material\nfact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of healthcare benefits, items, or services. In addition to\ncriminal penalties, violation of this statute may result in collateral administrative sanctions, including exclusion from participation in\nMedicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs.\nFederal False Claims Act and Civil Monetary Penalties Law. The Federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) provides, in part, that the\nfederal government or a private party on behalf of the government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has\nknowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who\nhas made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim paid or to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money\nto the federal government or who has knowingly retained an overpayment. In addition, amendments in 1986 to the Federal False\nClaims Act have made it easier for private parties to bring whistleblower lawsuits against companies. Further, on June 1, 2023, the\nUnited States Supreme Court issued a decision further clarifying the meaning of “knowingly” presenting a false claim for purposes\nof the FCA. This decision places newfound emphasis on the subjective beliefs of the person or entity making the claim, which may\ninvite closer scrutiny of health care providers’ subjective beliefs as to the compliance of claims submitted to governmental\nhealthcare programs.\nThe Civil Monetary Penalties Law provides, in part, that the federal government may seek civil monetary penalties against any\nperson who presents or causes to be presented claims to a Federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is\nfor an item or services that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent, or the person has made a false statement or used\na false record to get a claim paid. The federal government may also seek civil monetary penalties for a wide variety of other\nconduct, including offering remuneration to influence a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary’s selection of providers and violations of\nthe Federal Anti-Kickback Statute.\nAlthough we believe that we are in compliance with the Federal False Claims Act as well as the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, if we\nare found in violation of the same, we could be subject to various liabilities and penalties, including fines ranging from $13,946 to\n$27,894 for each false claim in violation of the Federal False Claims Act (as of 2023, and subject to annual adjustments for\ninflation) and varying amounts based on the type of violation of the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, plus up to three times the amount\nof damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person. In addition, the federal government may also\nseek exclusion from participation in all federal healthcare programs.\nIn addition, we bill Medicare Part B and other insurers directly for each sale to patients. As a result, we must comply with all laws,\nrules and regulations associated with filing claims with the Medicare program, including the Social Security Act, Medicare\nregulations, the Federal False Claims Act and the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, as well as a variety of additional federal and state\nlaws. During an audit, insurers typically expect to find explicit documentation in the medical record to support a claim. Physicians\nand other clinicians, who are responsible for prescribing our products for patients, are expected to create and maintain the medical\nrecords that form the basis for the claims we submit to Medicare and other insurers. Any failure by physicians and other clinicians\nto properly document the medical records for patients using our products could invalidate claims, impair our ability to collect\nsubmitted claims and subject us to overpayment liabilities, Federal False Claims Act liabilities and other penalties including\nexclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid or private insurance programs.\nTo the extent we are found to not be in compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations, we may be required to\ncurtail or restructure our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, exclusions, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could\nadversely affect our ability to operate our business, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nPage 9\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nState fraud and abuse provisions. Many states have also adopted some form of anti-kickback and anti-referral laws and false\nclaims acts that apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs.\nIn some states, these laws apply and we believe that we are in compliance with such laws. Nevertheless, a determination of liability\nunder such laws could result in fines and penalties, as well as restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Other Anti-Corruption Laws. We may be subject to a variety of domestic and\nforeign anti-corruption laws with respect to our regulatory compliance efforts and operations. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices\nAct (the “FCPA”) is a criminal statute that prohibits an individual or business from paying, offering, promising or authorizing the\nprovision of money (such as a bribe or kickback) or anything else of value (such as an improper gift, hospitality, or favor), directly or\nindirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision in order to assist the\nindividual or business in obtaining, retaining, or directing business or other advantages (such as favorable regulatory rulings). The\nFCPA also obligates companies with securities listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions. Those\nprovisions require a company such as ours to (i) maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions,\nexpenses and asset dispositions, and (ii) devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls sufficient to\nprovide reasonable assurances that transactions are properly authorized, executed and recorded. The FCPA is subject to broad\ninterpretation by the U.S. government. The past decade has seen a significant increase in enforcement activity. In addition to the\nFCPA, there are a number of other federal and state anti-corruption laws to which we may be subject, including, the U.S. domestic\nbribery statute contained in 18 USC § 201 (which prohibits bribing U.S. government officials) and the U.S. Travel Act (which in\nsome instances addresses private-sector or commercial bribery both within and outside the United States).\nWe could be held liable under the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws for the illegal activities of our employees, representatives,\ncontractors, collaborators, agents, subsidiaries, or affiliates, even if we did not explicitly authorize such activity. Although we will\nseek to comply with anti-corruption laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, representatives, contractors,\ncollaborators, agents, subsidiaries or affiliates will comply with these laws at all times. Violation of these laws could subject us to\nwhistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits,\nsignificant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and/or debarment from contracting with\ncertain governments or other persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage and other collateral\nconsequences. In addition, our directors, officers, employees, and other representatives who engage in violations of the FCPA and\ncertain other anti-corruption statutes may face imprisonment, fines and penalties. If any subpoenas or investigations are launched,\nor governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a\nmaterially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nEnforcement actions and sanctions could further harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHIPAA. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) established uniform standards governing the\nconduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of individually identifiable health\ninformation maintained or transmitted by healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses (collectively “covered\nentities”). The following standards have been promulgated under HIPAA’s regulations:\n• the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, which restrict the use and disclosure of\nindividually identifiable health information, or “protected health information”;\n• the Standards for Electronic Transactions, which establish standards for common healthcare transactions, such as claims\ninformation, plan eligibility, payment information and the use of electronic signatures;\n• the Security Standards, which require covered entities to implement and maintain certain security measures to safeguard\ncertain electronic health information, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect\nsuch information; and\n• the breach notification rules, which require covered entitles to provide notification to affected individuals, the HHS and the\nmedia in the event of a breach of unsecured protected health information.\nPage 10\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nIn 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) which included sweeping changes to\nHIPAA, including an expansion of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards. ARRA includes the Health Information Technology for\nEconomic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”) which, among other things, made HIPAA’s privacy and security standards\ndirectly applicable to business associates of covered entities. A business associate is a person or entity that performs certain\nfunctions or activities on behalf of a covered entity that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information. As a result,\nbusiness associates are now subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with applicable standards.\nMoreover, HITECH creates a new requirement to report certain breaches of unsecured, individually identifiable health information\nand imposes penalties on entities that fail to do so. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed\nagainst covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil\nactions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney fees and costs associated\nwith pursuing federal civil actions.\nThe 2013 final HITECH omnibus rule (the “HITECH Final Rule”) modifies the breach reporting standard in a manner that makes\nmore data security incidents qualify as reportable breaches. Any liability from a failure to comply with the requirements of HIPAA or\nthe HITECH Act could adversely affect our financial condition. The costs of complying with privacy and security related legal and\nregulatory requirements are burdensome and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The HITECH Final\nRule will continue to be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially\ncomplex compliance issues for us, as well as referring providers.\nIn addition to federal regulations issued under HIPAA, some states have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations that,\nin certain cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA. In those cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned\noperations and procedures to comply with the more stringent state laws. Most states have also adopted breach notification laws\nthat require notification to affected individuals and certain state agencies if there is a security breach of certain individually-\nidentifiable information. If we suffer a privacy or security breach, we could be required to expend significant resources to provide\nnotification to the affected individuals and address the breach, as well as reputational harm associated with the breach. If we fail to\ncomply with applicable state laws and regulations, we could be subject to additional sanctions. Any liability from failure to comply\nwith the requirements of HIPAA, HITECH or state privacy and security statutes or regulations could adversely affect our financial\ncondition. The costs of complying with privacy and security related legal and regulatory requirements are burdensome and could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral Regulatory Compliance and Health Care Reform\nThe evolving regulatory and compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different\ncompliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply\nfully with one or more of these requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws\ndescribed above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and\ncivil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government\nhealthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings and\nthe curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, financial\ncondition and our results of operations.\nIn March 2010, the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) was enacted into law in the United States. This healthcare reform, which included a\nnumber of provisions aimed at improving the quality and decreasing the cost of healthcare, has resulted in significant\nreimbursement cuts in Medicare payments to hospitals and other healthcare providers in the healthcare reimbursement system,\nevolving toward value- and outcomes-based reimbursement methodologies. It is uncertain what long-term consequences these\nprovisions will have on patient access to new technologies and what impact these provisions will have on Medicare reimbursement\nrates. Other elements of the ACA, including comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board and\npayment systems reform, including shared savings pilots and other reforms, may result in fundamental changes to federal\nhealthcare reimbursement programs. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"TCJA\") repealed penalties for noncompliance with the\nrequirement for insurance coverage known as the “individual mandate.” This change could affect whether individuals enroll in\nhealth plans and could impact insurers with which we contract. Other changes to the ACA could impact the number of patients who\nhave access to our products. Existing and additional legislative or administrative reforms, or any repeal of provisions, of the U.S.\nhealthcare reimbursement systems may significantly reduce reimbursement or otherwise impact coverage for our medical devices,\nor adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of such systems in coverage or reimbursement issues could have\nan adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nPage 11\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nThird-Party Reimbursement\nIn the United States and elsewhere, sales of medical devices depend in significant part on the availability of coverage and\nreimbursement to providers and patients from third-party payors. Third-party payors include private insurance plans and\ngovernmental programs. As with other medical devices, reimbursement for our products can differ significantly from payor to payor,\nand our products are not universally covered by third-party commercial payors. Further, third-party payors continually review\nexisting technologies for continued coverage and can, with limited notice, deny or reverse coverage for existing products.\nTwo principal governmental third-party payors in the United States are Medicare and Medicaid. Medicare is a federal program that\nprovides certain medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, certain disabled persons and others. In contrast, Medicaid\nis a medical assistance program jointly funded by federal and state governments to serve certain individuals and families with low\nincomes and who meet other eligibility requirements. Each state administers its own Medicaid program which determines the\nbenefits made available to the Medicaid recipients in that state. The Medicare and Medicaid statutory framework is subject to\nadministrative rulings, interpretations and discretion that affect the amount and timing of reimbursement made under Medicare and\nMedicaid.\nCMS, which is the agency within the HHS that administers both Medicare and Medicaid, has the authority to decline to cover\nparticular products or services if it determines that they are not “reasonable and necessary” for the treatment of Medicare\nbeneficiaries. A coverage determination for a product, which establishes the indications that will be covered, and any restrictions or\nlimitations, can be developed at the national level by CMS through a National Coverage Determination (“NCD”) or at the local level\nthrough a Local Coverage Determination (“LCD”) by a regional DME MAC. CMS could issue new NCDs or the regional DME MACs\ncould issue LCDs related to a full range of respiratory DME products. If such NCDs or LCDs are issued or revised, they could\nsignificantly alter the coverage under Medicare and materially impact our business.\nWith respect to our ventilator products, an NCD for the DME Reference List, which has been effective since April 1, 2003, indicates\nthat ventilators, including our products, are covered for the treatment of neuromuscular diseases, thoracic restrictive diseases, and\nchronic respiratory failure consequent to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. While the NCD for the DME Reference List has\nbeen updated, no separate NCD has been issued for ventilators. Monthly rental revenue from ventilators represented\napproximately 59% and 68%, respectively, of traditional revenue, excluding COVID-19 response sales and services, for 2023 and\n2022. Medicare Administrative Contractors responsible for processing durable medical equipment claims have issued LCDs for\nRespiratory Assist Devices (“RADs”) which contain language describing an overlap in conditions used to determine coverage for\nRADs and ventilator devices. These LCDs state that the treatment plan for any individual patient, including the determination to use\na ventilator or a BiPAP, may vary and will be made based upon the specifics of each individual beneficiary’s medical condition. Due\nto this variability, determinations of coverage for our ventilator products are subject to scrutiny of individual medical records and\nclaims. Revenues from Medicare and Medicaid accounted for 46% and 56%, respectively, of traditional revenue, excluding\nCOVID-19 response sales and services, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nBecause Medicare criteria is extensive, we have a team dedicated to educating prescribers to help them understand how Medicare\npolicy affects their patients and the medical record documentation needed to meet both NCD and LCD requirements. We maintain\nopen communication with physician key opinion leaders and with Medicare Administrative Contractors to provide data as it\nbecomes available that could potentially influence coverage decisions. We also continue to closely monitor our Medicare business\nto identify trends that could have a negative impact on certain Medicare patients’ access to our products, which in turn could have\nan adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCommercial payors that reimburse for our products do so in a variety of ways, depending on the insurance plan’s policies,\nemployer and benefit manager input, and contracts with their provider network. Moreover, Medicaid programs and some\ncommercial insurance plans, especially Medicare Advantage plans (commercial insurers that are administering Medicare benefits\nto certain beneficiaries), are frequently influenced by Medicare coverage determinations. In working with payors who follow\nMedicare criteria, we have focused on clear communications with insurers to ensure mutual understanding of criteria interpretation,\nwhich differs significantly among the plans from very restrictive to quite lenient, and we then work closely with prescribers to\neducate them accordingly. While this approach has had positive impact, we do not know if or when additional payors may adopt the\nLCD criteria nor do we know how they will choose to interpret it.\nWe believe a reduction or elimination of coverage or reimbursement of our products by Medicare would likely cause some\ncommercial third-party payors to implement similar reductions in their coverage or reimbursement of our products. If we are unable\nto expand coverage of our products by additional commercial payors, or if third-party payors that currently cover or reimburse for\nour products reverse or limit their coverage in the future, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nPage 12\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”). For as long as we\nare an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are\napplicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to\ncomply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations\nregarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding\nadvisory “say-on-pay” votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation. We\nwill remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of (i) the last day of our fiscal year in which we have total annual gross\nrevenues of $1.07 billion (as such amount is indexed for inflation every five years by the SEC to reflect the change in the Consumer\nPrice Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, setting the threshold to the nearest $1 million) or\nmore; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of common equity securities\npursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”); (iii) the date on\nwhich we have, during the prior three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; and (iv) the date on which\nwe are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the Exchange Act.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common shares less attractive to the extent we rely on the exemptions available to\nemerging growth companies. If some investors find our common shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active\ntrading market for our common shares and our share price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended\ntransition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An\nemerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise\napply to private companies. We may choose to take advantage of such extended transition period.\nCompetition\nThe respiratory care industry is highly competitive. While Viemed is one of the top providers of NIV and related services in the\nUnited States, its current competitors may gain market share, and any new entrants, with greater financial and technical resources,\nmay provide additional competition. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that Viemed will be able to grow its operations\norganically to meet the competitive environment.\nSignificant Customers\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Viemed had no customers that accounted for 10% or more of its consolidated\nrevenue streams.\nViemed earns revenues by seeking reimbursement from Medicare and private health insurance companies, with the Medicare\nprogram of the United States government being the primary entity making payments. If the Medicare program were to slow\npayments of Viemed receivables for any reason, Viemed would be adversely impacted.\nA majority of the Company’s revenues are derived from the fee-for-service pricing guidelines set by CMS. These pricing guidelines\nare subject to change at the discretion of CMS.\nEmployees\nAt December 31, 2023, Viemed had 996 permanent employees, in addition to temporary employees and independent contractors\nengaged through the Company's healthcare staffing and recruitment services to supplement the workforce needs of third party\nhealthcare facilities.\nPage 13\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Business\nWe compete against companies that have longer operating histories and greater resources, which may result in reduced\nprofit margins and loss of market share.\nThe respiratory care industry is highly competitive and dynamic and may become more competitive as new players enter the\nmarket. Certain competitors will be subsidiaries or divisions of larger, much better capitalized companies. Certain competitors will\nhave vertically integrated manufacturing and services sectors of the market. We may have less capital and may encounter greater\noperational challenges in serving the market. Better capitalized competitors may also be able to borrow money or raise debt to\npurchase equipment more easily than us. Potential competitors could have significantly greater financial, research and\ndevelopment, manufacturing, and sales and marketing resources than we have and could utilize their greater resources to acquire\nor develop new technologies or products that could effectively compete with our existing products. Additionally, demand for our\nhome monitoring services and other services could be diminished by equivalent or superior products and services developed by\ncompetitors. Competing in these markets could result in price-cutting, reduced profit margins and loss of market share, any of\nwhich would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nReductions in reimbursement rates may have a materially adverse impact on the profitability of our operations.\nReimbursement for our services primarily comes from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and\nprivate health insurance companies, and our ability to sell our products and services depends in large part on the extent to which\ncoverage and adequate reimbursement for our products and services are and will continue to be available. The reimbursement\nrates offered are outside of our control. The CARES Act previously introduced a blended rate for HME furnished in non-rural or\ncontiguous non-competitive bidding areas that is based on 75% of the adjusted fee schedule amount and 25% of the unadjusted\nfee schedule amount. The 75/25 blended Medicare reimbursement rate expired on December 31, 2023, reverting to rates in place\nprior to the implementation of the 75/25 blend, adjusted for inflation. This change may lead to reduced reimbursement for\ncompetitive bid products and services in specific markets where we operate.\nReimbursement rates for our services, like much of the United States healthcare market, are subject to reductions. We cannot\npredict the extent and timing of any reduction in reimbursement rates and we cannot assure you that coverage and reimbursement\nwill be available for our products or services, that reimbursement amounts will be adequate, or that reimbursement amounts, even\nif initially adequate, will not be subsequently reduced.\nReductions in reimbursement rates, if they occur, may have a material adverse impact on the profitability of our operations. A\nreduction in reimbursement without a concurrent decline in the cost of operations, may result in reduced profitability. Our costs of\noperations could increase, but we may be unable to pass on the cost increases to customers because reimbursement rates are set\nwithout regard to the cost of service, also resulting in reduced profitability.\nOur reliance on only a few sources of reimbursement for our services could result in delays in reimbursement, which\ncould adversely affect cash flow and revenues.\nWe earn revenues by seeking reimbursement for our products and services from governmental healthcare programs and private\nhealth insurance companies, primarily from the federal Medicare program. If the Medicare program were to slow payments of our\nreceivables for any reason, we would be adversely impacted. In addition, both governmental healthcare programs and private\nhealth insurance companies may seek ways to avoid or delay reimbursement, which could adversely affect our cash flow and\nrevenues.\nPage 14\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nOur dependence on key suppliers puts us at risk of interruptions in the availability of the equipment we need for our\nservices, which could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe require the timely delivery of a sufficient supply of equipment we use to perform our home treatment of patients. Our\ndependence on third-party suppliers involves several additional risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality and\ndelivery schedules. In addition, there are a limited number of manufacturers of the equipment used for home treatment of patients\nwith ventilation respiratory therapy, which has been further exacerbated by Philips Respironics' January 2024 decision to\ndiscontinue of many of its respiratory products. Dependence on only a few manufacturers presents risks that suppliers may not be\nable to provide or adequately provide sufficient equipment to satisfy demand. Demand may also outstrip supply, leading to\nequipment shortages that could adversely affect our operations. Inadequate supply could also impair our ability to attract new\nbusiness and could create upward pricing pressure on equipment and supplies, adversely affecting our margins. Conversely,\nincorrect demand forecasting could lead to excess inventory, which we may not be able to sell. If we fail to achieve certain volume\nof sales, prices of ventilators may increase, leading to reduced revenue and profitability. The industry is subject to a high level of\nregulatory scrutiny, and government or manufacturer recalls could adversely affect our ability to provide products and services and\nachieve revenue targets. Additionally, the market for financing ventilators and other supplies we need could be more difficult in the\nfuture.\nOn June 14, 2021, Royal Philips (“Philips”), one of our largest suppliers of BiPAP and CPAP and mechanical ventilator devices,\ninitiated a voluntary recall notification with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for certain Philips BiPAP and CPAP and\nmechanical ventilator devices that we distribute and sell. Philips initiated this recall to address potential health risks related to the\npolyester-based polyurethane (“PE-PUR”) sound abatement foam component in these devices. The PE-PUR sound abatement\nfoam, which is used to reduce sound and vibration in these affected devices, may break down and potentially enter the device’s air\npathway and may off-gas certain chemicals. If this occurs, black debris from the foam or certain chemicals released into the\ndevice’s air pathway may be inhaled or swallowed by the person using the device. In July 2021, the FDA identified the Philips recall\nas a Class I recall, the most serious type of recall. Patients using these devices have been instructed to contact their health care\nprovider and doctor about a suitable treatment for their condition. As of December 2023, Philips has announced remediation of\n99% of actionable sleep therapy device registrations.\nWe cannot predict the potential legal, regulatory, and financial risks that may arise out of the recall. For example, we may be asked\nto notify patients of the recall, retrieve recalled devices from patients, and/or provide replacement devices, resulting in additional\nunreimbursed costs. Some patients may discontinue use of their device, which could affect our ability to continue billing for service.\nViemed has been named in and may be subject to future litigation related to the recall, including individual and putative class action\nclaims related to personal injury for devices affected by the recall as well as claims regarding repair and replacement of devices\naffected by the recall. Viemed cannot predict what additional actions will be required of the Company by the FDA or other state or\nfederal agencies related to the recall.\nWe conduct all of our operations through our United States subsidiaries and our ability to extract value from these\nsubsidiaries may be limited.\nWe conduct all of our operations through our United States subsidiaries. Therefore, to the extent of these holdings, we (directly and\nindirectly) will be dependent on the cash flows of these subsidiaries to meet our obligations. The ability of such subsidiaries to\nmake payments to their parent companies may be constrained by a variety of factors, including, the level of taxation, particularly\ncorporate profits and withholding taxes, in the jurisdiction in which each subsidiary operates, and the introduction of exchange\ncontrols or repatriation restrictions or the availability of hard currency to be repatriated. Additionally, our subsidiaries are restricted\nfrom making distributions to us by our existing commercial credit facilities, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe failure to attract or to retain management or key operating personnel, including directors, could adversely affect\noperations.\nOur success to date has depended, and will continue to depend, largely on the skills and efforts of our management team,\nincluding our ability to interpret market data correctly and to interpret and respond to economic, market and other conditions in\norder to locate and adopt appropriate opportunities. We are also dependent on the services of key executives, including our\ndirectors and a small number of highly skilled and experienced executives and personnel. Due to our relatively small size, the loss\nof a key individual on our management team or our inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees and suitably\nqualified staff could have a material adverse impact on our business and future operations. No assurance can be given that\nindividuals with the required skills will continue employment with us or that replacement personnel with comparable skills can be\nfound.\nPage 15\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nWe have significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements. If we are unable to obtain necessary capital on favorable\nterms or at all, we may not be able to execute on our business plans and our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, cash flows and prospects may be adversely affected.\nOur development and the business (including acquisitions) may require additional financing, which may involve high transaction\ncosts, dilution to shareholders, high interest rates or unfavorable terms and conditions. Failure to obtain sufficient financing may\nresult in the delay or indefinite postponement of our business plans and our business, financial condition, results of operations and\nprospects may be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that additional capital or other types of financing will be available\nif needed or that, if available, the terms of such financing will be favorable to us.\nWe are subject to the risks of litigation and governmental proceedings, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are, and in the future may be, subject to legal and governmental proceedings and claims. The parties in such legal actions may\nseek amounts from us that may not be covered in whole or in part by insurance. Defending ourselves against such legal actions\ncould result in significant costs and could require a substantial amount of time and effort by our management team. We cannot\npredict the outcome of litigation or governmental proceedings to which we are a party or whether we will be subject to future legal\nactions. As a result, the potential costs associated with legal actions against us could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects.\nInsurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability.\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and hazards generally. Such occurrences could result in damage to property,\ninventory, facilities, personal injury or death, damage to our properties, or the properties of others, monetary losses and possible\nlegal liability. We may be subject to product liability and medical malpractice claims, which may adversely affect our operations. Our\nindustry is highly regulated, and may be subject to regulatory scrutiny for violations of regulations and laws. We could be adversely\naffected by the time and cost involved with regulatory investigations even if we have operated in compliance with all laws.\nInvestigations could also adversely affect the timely payment of receivables.\nAlthough we maintain insurance to protect against certain risks in such amounts as we consider to be reasonable, our insurance\nwill not cover all the potential risks associated with our operations. We may also be unable to maintain insurance to cover these\nrisks at economically feasible premiums. Insurance coverage may not continue to be available or may not be adequate to cover\nany resulting liability. We might also become subject to liability which may not be insured against or which we may elect not to\ninsure against because of premium costs or other reasons. Losses from these events may cause us to incur significant costs that\ncould have a material adverse effect upon our financial performance and results of operations.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that\ntechnology, including any cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we receive certain personal information, in both physical and electronic formats, about our\npatients, our employees, and our vendors. We maintain substantial security measures and data backup systems to protect, store,\nand prevent unauthorized access to such information. Nevertheless, it is possible that computer hackers and others (through\ncyberattacks, which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, or by other means) might defeat our security\nmeasures in the future and obtain the personal information of customers, their loved ones, our employees, and our vendors that we\nhold. If we fail to protect this information, we could experience significant costs and expenses as well as damage to our reputation.\nAdditionally, legislation relating to cybersecurity threats could impose additional requirements on our operations.\nOur ability to manage and maintain our internal reports effectively and integration of new business acquisitions depends\nsignificantly on our enterprise resource planning system and other information systems. Some of our information technology\nsystems may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with ongoing systems\nimplementation work. The failure of our systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security or\nother unauthorized access of these systems, may also result in reduced efficiency of our operations and could require significant\ncapital investments to remediate any such failure, problem or breach and to comply with applicable regulations, all of which could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruptions in the credit and financial markets may have an adverse impact on our ability to obtain capital and financing\nfor our operations.\nMarket events and conditions, including disruptions in the international credit markets and other financial systems and the\ndeterioration of global economic conditions, could impede our access to capital or increase the cost of capital. These disruptions\ncould, among other things, make it more difficult for us to obtain, or increase our cost of obtaining, capital and financing for our\noperations. Access to additional capital may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nPage 16\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nOur strategic growth plan, which involves the acquisition of other businesses, may not succeed.\nOur strategic growth plan calls for significant growth in our business over the next several years through an increase in our density\nin select markets where we are established as well as the expansion of our geographic footprint into new markets. This growth\nwould place (and has placed) significant demands on our management team, systems, internal controls and financial and\nprofessional resources. As a result, we could be required to incur (and have incurred) expenses for hiring additional qualified\npersonnel, retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems and expanding our information\ntechnology infrastructure. If we are unable to effectively manage growth, our financial results could be adversely impacted.Our\nstrategic growth plan contemplates continued growth from future acquisitions of home medical equipment and service providers.\nWe may face increased competition for attractive acquisition candidates, which may limit the number of acquisition opportunities\navailable to us or lead to the payment of higher prices for acquisitions. Without successful acquisitions, our future growth rate could\ndecline. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any future acquisitions, if consummated, will result in further growth.\nThe integration of acquisitions requires significant attention from management, may impose substantial demands on our operations\nor other projects and may impose challenges on us including, but not limited to, consistencies in business standards, procedures,\npolicies and business cultures. We cannot assure you that any future acquisitions, if consummated, will result in further growth.\nSpecific integration risks relating to our acquisition of other businesses may include: difficulties related to combining previously\nseparate businesses into a single unit, including patient transitions, product and service offerings, distribution and operational\ncapabilities and business cultures; availability of financing to the extent needed to fund acquisitions; customer loss and other\ngeneral business disruption; managing the integration process while completing other independent acquisitions or dispositions;\ndiversion of management’s attention from day-to-day operations; assumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including\nunforeseen or contingent liabilities or liabilities in excess of the amounts estimated; failure to realize anticipated benefits and\nsynergies, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; potentially substantial costs and expenses associated with\nacquisitions and dispositions; and failure to retain and motivate key employees difficulties in establishing and applying our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures to an acquired business.\nWe may be negatively impacted by inflation.\nCurrent and anticipated inflationary effects may have an adverse effect on our business and be influenced by various factors,\nincluding general cost increases, disruptions in our supply chain, and governmental stimulus or fiscal policies. The services and\nproducts we provide to patients are subject to fluctuations based on the costs of materials, labor, and transportation, including fuel\nexpenses. The rising costs of our services and products can be attributed, in part, to increased shipping expenses and general\ninflationary trends. Moreover, there is uncertainty regarding our ability to pass on these increased costs to customers to mitigate\ninflationary pressures. Sustained increases in inflation could impact the overall demand for our products and services, as well as\nour labor, equipment, and product costs, potentially affecting our profit margins. This, in turn, could have adverse consequences for\nour business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Despite recent inflationary trends, we cannot accurately\npredict whether these patterns will persist. Future volatility in general price inflation and its impact on material availability, shipping,\nwarehousing, and operational overhead could further impact financial results. We attempt to address these pressures through our\ninflation-linked reimbursement contracts, negotiation, leveraging our purchasing power and embracing technology, such as our\nproprietary clinical management platform.\nRisks Relating to Government Regulation\nHealthcare reform legislation may affect our business.\nHealthcare reform laws significantly affect the U.S. healthcare services industry. In recent years, many legislative proposals have\nbeen introduced or proposed in Congress and in some state legislatures that would affect major changes in the healthcare system,\neither nationally or at the state level. At the federal level, Congress has continued to propose or consider healthcare budgets that\nsubstantially reduce payments under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. See “Business–Government Regulation” in Item 1 for\nmore information. The ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation and the impact of potential legislation\non us is uncertain and difficult, if not impossible, to predict. That impact may be material to our business, financial condition or\nresults of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, and if we fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could\nsuffer severe criminal or civil sanctions or be required to make significant changes to our operations that could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe federal government and all states in which we currently operate regulate various aspects of our business. Our operations also\nare subject to state laws governing, among other things, distribution of medical equipment and certain types of home health\nactivities, and we are required to obtain and maintain licenses in each state to act as a DME supplier. Additionally, accreditation is\nrequired by many payors. If we fail to obtain or maintain any required accreditation, it could have an adverse impact on our\nbusiness.\nPage 17\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nAs a healthcare provider participating in governmental healthcare programs, we are subject to laws directed at preventing fraud,\nwaste, and abuse, which subject our marketing, billing, documentation and other practices to government scrutiny. These include\nspecific requirements imposed by the DME MAC Supplier Manuals. To ensure compliance with Medicare and Medicaid\nrequirements and other federal and state regulations, government agencies or their contractors often conduct routine audits and\nrequest customer records and other documents to support our claims submitted for payment of services rendered. Government\nagencies or their contractors also periodically open investigations and obtain information from healthcare providers. Violations of\nfederal and state regulations can result in severe criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, and sanctions, including\ndebarment, suspension or exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other government reimbursement programs, any of which would\nhave a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe expect the federal and state governments to continue their efforts to contain growth in Medicaid expenditures, which\ncould adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nMedicaid spending has increased rapidly in recent years, becoming a significant component of state budgets. This, combined with\nslower state revenue growth, has led both the federal government and many states to institute measures aimed at controlling the\ngrowth of Medicaid spending, and in some instances reducing aggregate Medicaid spending. We expect these state and federal\nefforts to continue for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, not all of the states in which we operate have elected to expand\nMedicaid coverage as part of federal healthcare reform legislation. There can be no assurance that any state Medicaid program, on\nthe current terms or otherwise, will continue for any particular period of time beyond the foreseeable future. If Medicaid\nreimbursement rates are reduced or fail to increase as quickly as our costs, or if there are changes in the rules governing the\nMedicaid program that are disadvantageous to our businesses, our business and results of operations could be materially and\nadversely affected.\nRevenue we receive from third-party payors as well as Medicare and Medicaid is subject to potential retroactive\nreduction.\nPayments we receive from governmental healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and private third-party payors\ncan be retroactively adjusted after examination during the claims settlement process or as a result of post-payment audits and\nsubsequent recoupment. Governmental healthcare programs and third-party payors may disallow, in whole or in part, our requests\nfor reimbursement, or recoup amounts previously reimbursed, based on determinations by the payors or their third-party audit\ncontractors that certain costs are not reimbursable because either adequate or additional documentation was not provided or\nbecause certain services were not covered or were deemed not to be medically necessary. Significant adjustments, recoupments\nor repayments of our Medicare or Medicaid revenue, and the costs associated with complying with investigative audits by\nregulatory and governmental authorities and private third-party payors, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition,\nresults of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, from time to time we become aware, based on information provided by third parties and/or the results of internal\naudits, of payments from such payor sources that were either wholly or partially in excess of the amount that we should have been\npaid for the service provided. Overpayments may result from a variety of factors, including insufficient documentation supporting\nthe services rendered or medical necessity or other failures to document satisfaction of the applicable conditions of payment. We\nare required by law in most instances to refund the full amount of the overpayment after becoming aware of it, and failure to do so\nwithin requisite time limits imposed by law could lead to significant fines and penalties being imposed on us.\nFurthermore, our initial billing of and payments for services that are unsupported by the requisite documentation and satisfaction of\nany other conditions of payment, regardless of our awareness of the failure at the time of the billing or payment, could expose us to\nsignificant fines and penalties. We could also be subject to exclusion from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid programs in\nsome circumstances as well, in addition to any monetary or other fines, penalties or sanctions that we may incur under applicable\nfederal and/or state law. Our repayment of any such amounts, as well as any fines, penalties or other sanctions that we may incur,\ncould be significant and could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time we are also involved in external governmental investigations, audits and reviews. Reviews, audits and\ninvestigations of this sort can lead to government actions, which can result in recoupment of reimbursement, civil or criminal fines\nor penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion\nfrom participation in government healthcare programs. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules could have a\nmaterial and adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, responding to\ngovernmental investigations, audits and reviews can also require us to incur significant legal and document production expenses,\nregardless of whether the particular investigation, audit or review leads to identification of underlying noncompliance or\nwrongdoing.\nPage 18\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nAs a result of increased post-payment reviews of claims we submit to Medicare and Medicaid for our services, we may\nincur additional costs and may be required to repay amounts already paid to us.\nWe are subject to regular post-payment inquiries, investigations and audits of claims we submit to Medicare and Medicaid for\npayment for our services. These post-payment reviews have increased as a result of government cost-containment initiatives.\nThese additional post-payment reviews may require us to incur costs to respond to requests for records and to pursue the reversal\nof payment denials, and ultimately may require us to refund amounts paid to us by Medicare or Medicaid that are determined to\nhave been overpaid.\nFor a further description of this and other laws and regulations involving governmental reimbursements, see “Business—\nGovernment Regulation” in Item 1.\nAn economic downturn, state budget pressures, sustained unemployment and continued deficit spending by the federal\ngovernment may result in a reduction in reimbursement and covered services.\nAn economic downturn could have a detrimental effect on our revenues. Historically, state budget pressures have translated into\nreductions in state spending. Given that Medicaid outlays are a significant component of state budgets, we can expect continuing\ncost containment pressures on Medicaid outlays for our services in the states in which we operate. In addition, an economic\ndownturn, coupled with sustained unemployment, may also impact the number of enrollees in managed care programs as well as\nthe profitability of managed care companies, which could result in reduced reimbursement rates.\nThe existing federal deficit, as well as deficit spending by federal and state governments as the result of adverse economic\ndevelopments or other reasons, can lead to continuing pressure to reduce governmental expenditures for other purposes, including\ngovernment-funded programs in which we participate, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Such actions in turn may adversely affect\nour operations and revenue.\nDelays in reimbursement due to state budget deficits may increase in the future, adversely affecting our liquidity.\nThere is a delay between the time that we provide services and the time that we receive reimbursement or payment for these\nservices. Many of the states in which we operate are operating with budget deficits for their current fiscal year. These and other\nstates may in the future delay reimbursement, which would adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, from time to time, procedural\nissues require us to resubmit claims before payment is remitted, which contributes to our aged receivables. Additionally,\nunanticipated delays in receiving reimbursement from state programs due to changes in their policies or billing or audit procedures\nmay adversely impact our liquidity and working capital. We fund operations primarily through the collection of accounts receivable.\nDelays in reimbursement due to claims submission reimbursement processes may cause liquidity problems.\nThere are delays in reimbursement from the time we provide services to the time we receive reimbursement or payment for these\nservices. Delays may result from changes by third-party payors to data submission requirements or requests by fiscal\nintermediaries for additional data or documentation, among other issues. If we have information system problems or issues that\narise with Medicare or Medicaid or private health insurers, we may encounter delays in our payment cycle. Such timing delays may\ncause working capital shortages. Working capital management, including prompt and diligent billing and collection, is an important\nfactor in our results of operations and liquidity. System problems, Medicare or Medicaid issues or industry trends may extend our\ncollection period, adversely impact our working capital. Our working capital management procedures may not successfully negate\nthis risk. There are often timing delays when attempting to collect funds from Medicaid programs. Delays in receiving\nreimbursement or payments from these programs may adversely impact our working capital.\nWe depend in part upon reimbursement by third-party payors.\nA substantial portion of our revenues are derived from private and governmental third-party payors. In 2023, approximately 54% of\nour revenues were derived collectively from managed care plans, commercial health insurers, workers’ compensation payors, and\nother private pay revenue sources while approximately 46% of our revenues were derived from Medicare and Medicaid. Initiatives\nundertaken by industry and government to contain healthcare costs affect our profitability. These payors attempt to control\nhealthcare costs by contracting with healthcare providers to obtain services on a discounted basis. We believe that this trend will\ncontinue and may limit reimbursement for healthcare services. Additionally, from time to time our contracts with payors are\nterminated, amended or renegotiated, sometime unilaterally through policies. If insurers or managed care companies from whom\nwe receive substantial payments were to terminate, amend or renegotiate contracts or reduce the amounts they pay for services,\nour profit margins may decline, or we may lose patients if we choose not to renew our contracts with these insurers at lower rates.\nPage 19\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nWe face inspections, reviews, audits and investigations under federal and state government programs and contracts.\nThese audits could have adverse findings that may negatively affect our business.\nAs a result of our participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, we are subject to various governmental inspections,\nreviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with these programs and applicable laws and regulations. Private health\ninsurers may also reserve the right to conduct audits. An adverse inspection, review, audit or investigation could result in:\n• refunding amounts we have been paid pursuant to the Medicare or Medicaid programs or from private health insurers;\n• state or federal agencies imposing fines, penalties and other sanctions on us;\n• temporary suspension of payment for new patients;\n• decertification or exclusion from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid programs or one or more managed care payor\nnetworks;\n• damage to our reputation; and\n• loss of certain rights under, or termination of, our contracts with private health insurers.\nIf adverse inspections, reviews, audits or investigations occur and any of the results noted above occur, it could have a material\nadverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations relating to the privacy and security of protected health\ninformation and failure to comply with such laws may increase our operational costs.\nHIPAA privacy and security regulations establish a complex regulatory framework governing the use and disclosure of protected\nhealth information (\"PHI\"), including, for example, the circumstances under which uses and disclosures of PHI are permitted or\nrequired without a specific authorization by the patient; a patient’s right to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain\ndisclosures of PHI; the content of notices of privacy practices describing how PHI is used and disclosed and individuals’ rights with\nrespect to their PHI; and implementation of administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect privacy and security of PHI.\nThe federal privacy regulations restrict our ability to use or disclose certain individually identifiable patient health information,\nwithout patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined by HIPAA), except\nfor disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. The HIPAA\nprivacy and security regulations do not supersede state laws that may be more stringent; therefore, we are required to comply with\nboth federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws and regulations.\nThe HIPAA privacy and security regulations also require healthcare providers like us to notify affected individuals, the HHS\nSecretary, and in some cases, the media, when PHI has been “breached”, as defined by HIPAA. Many states have similar breach\nnotification laws. We have established policies and procedures in an effort to ensure compliance with the HIPAA privacy and\nsecurity regulations and similar state laws. However, if there is a breach, we may be required to incur costs to mitigate and\nremediate the impact of the breach on affected individuals, and therefore could incur substantial operational and financial costs\nrelated to such mitigation and remediation. Additionally, HIPAA, and its implementing regulations provide for significant civil fines,\ncriminal penalties, and other sanctions for failure to comply with the privacy, security, and breach notification rules, including for\nwrongful or impermissible use or disclosure of PHI. Although HIPAA regulations do not expressly provide for a private right of action\nfor damages, we could incur damages under state laws to private parties for the wrongful or impermissible use or disclosure of\nconfidential health information or other private personal information. Additionally, HIPAA allows state Attorneys General to bring an\naction against a covered entity, such as us, for a violation of HIPAA. We insure some of our risk with respect to HIPAA security\nbreaches, but operational costs and penalties associated with HIPAA breaches easily could exceed our insured limits.\nHIPAA regulations impose additional requirements, restrictions and penalties on covered entities and their business associates to,\namong other things, deter breaches of security. Our electronic health records system is periodically modified to meet applicable\nsecurity standards. Despite the implementation of various security measures by us, our infrastructure may be vulnerable to\ncomputer viruses, break-ins and other disruptive problems inadvertently introduced by authorized users such as employees and\nclients, or purposefully targeted by hackers and other cybercriminals which could lead to interruption, delays or cessation in service\nto our clients. Further, such incidents, whether electronic or physical, could jeopardize the security of confidential information,\nincluding PHI and other sensitive information stored in our computer systems related to clients, patients, and other parties\nconnected through us, which may deter potential clients and give rise to uncertain liability to parties whose security or privacy has\nbeen infringed. A significant security breach could result in fines, loss of clients, damage to our reputation, direct damages, costs of\nrepair and detection, costs to remedy the breach, government penalties, and other expenses. We insure some of our risk with\nrespect to security breaches but the occurrence of any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations and our financial condition.\nPage 20\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nOur products may be subject to future rounds of Medicare's Competitive Bidding Program, which may negatively affect\nour business and financial condition.\nThe Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 required the HHS to establish and implement\nprograms under which competitive acquisition areas are established throughout the United States for purposes of awarding\ncontracts for the furnishing of competitively priced items of DME.\nCMS, the agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, conducts a competition for each competitive acquisition\narea under which providers submit bids to supply certain covered items of DME. Under the competitive bidding program, DME\nsuppliers compete to become Medicare contract suppliers by submitting bids to furnish certain items in competitive bidding areas.\nAs part of the competitive bidding process, SPAs replace the current Medicare DME fee schedule payment amounts for selected\nitems in certain areas of the country. The SPAs are determined by using bids submitted by DME suppliers.\nSuccessful bidders must meet certain program quality standards in order to be awarded a contract and only successful bidders can\nsupply the covered items to Medicare beneficiaries in the acquisition area. There are, however, regulations in place that allow non-\ncontracted providers to continue to provide products and services to their existing customers at the new competitive bidding\npayment amounts. The contracts are expected to be re-bid every three years. CMS is required to award contracts to multiple\nentities submitting bids in each area for an item or service, but has the authority to limit the number of contractors in a competitive\nacquisition area as necessary to meet projected demand.\nIn 2019, CMS announced the inclusion of non-invasive ventilator products on the list of products subject to the competitive bidding\nprogram in Round 2021 which covers the period of January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2023. Rental revenue from ventilator\nproducts represents a significant portion of our revenue (approximately 59.2% of total revenue in 2023). On March 9, 2020, CMS\nannounced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States President’s exercise of the Defense Production Act, public\nconcern regarding access to ventilators, and the non-invasive ventilators product category being new to the competitive bidding\nprogram, non-invasive ventilators were removed as a product category from Round 2021. On October 27, 2020, CMS announced\nthat it had removed 13 of the 15 remaining product categories from Round 2021, including oxygen and PAP devices, because the\npayment amounts did not achieve expected savings. As a result of these announcements, we retain the ability to continue to\nfurnish non-invasive ventilators and oxygen and PAP devices for all of our Medicare accredited areas. The current Round 2021\ncontracts expired on December 31, 2023 and CMS has not announced a new round of competitive bidding. Historically, CMS\nannounces new rounds of competitive bidding and starts the process approximately 18 months prior to the contract start date. We\ncannot predict at this time the full impact the competitive bidding program and the developments in the competitive bidding program\nwill have on our business and financial condition. In addition, we cannot assure you that non-invasive ventilators and oxygen and\nPAP devices will not be included on the list of products subject to the competitive bidding program in the future. If changes are\nmade to the competitive program in the future, it could affect our reimbursement and revenue.\nIf CMS requires prior authorization for our products, our revenue and cash flow could be negatively impacted.\nCMS maintains a Master List of Items Frequently Subject to Unnecessary Utilization. This list identifies items that could potentially\nbe subject to prior authorization as a condition of Medicare Payment. On April 22, 2019, CMS added home ventilators used with a\nnon-invasive interface to the Master List of Items Frequently Subject to Unnecessary Utilization. If CMS imposes prior authorization\nrequirements for non-invasive home ventilation, it could materially impact our business, revenue and cash flow.\nIf we fail to comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback laws, false claims acts, self-\nreferral prohibitions, and anti-inducement laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and\nfinancial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving\nremuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the\npurchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or any other federal healthcare program.\nThe Anti-Kickback Statute, and similar state laws prohibit payments intended to induce physicians or others to refer patients or to\nacquire or arrange for or recommend the acquisition of healthcare products or services. These laws restrict sales, marketing and\nother promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, which may be used with\nhospitals, physicians, and other potential purchasers or prescribers of our products. The statutory exceptions and regulatory safe\nharbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution are drawn narrowly, and any remuneration to or from a prescriber or\npurchaser of healthcare products or services may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Our\npractices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. However, practices that\ndo not fit into a safe harbor are not per se illegal, and are instead analyzed based on the particular facts and circumstances to\ndetermine whether the practice presents a low risk of fraud and abuse. Although we believe our practices are compliant with\napplicable safe harbors, we cannot assure you that a government regulator will not take the position that some of our practices do\nnot meet all of the narrow criteria of an applicable safe harbor and otherwise violate the Anti-Kickback Statute.\nPage 21\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe Federal False Claims Act prohibits, in part, any person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false claim for\npayment to the federal government, or knowingly making or causing to be made a false statement to get a false claim paid. The\nmajority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and Federal False Claims Act, which\napply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in certain states, apply regardless of payor.\nThese false claims acts allow any person to bring suit in the name of the government alleging false and fraudulent claims\npresented to or paid by the government (or for other violations of the statutes) and to share a certain portion of amounts paid by the\nentity to the government in fines or settlement. Such suits, often referred to as qui tam actions, have increased significantly in the\nhealthcare industry in recent years.\nSanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion from participation in the Medicare and\nMedicaid programs, criminal fines and imprisonment. In addition, the ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of\nthe Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity generally does not need to have actual\nknowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have criminal and/or civil exposure. In addition, the ACA\nprovides that the government may assert that a claim, including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-\nKickback Statute, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the Federal False Claims Act. Because of the breadth of\nthese laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors and exceptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be\nsubject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge, regardless of the outcome, could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, business relationships, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Ethics in Patient Referrals Act, commonly known as the \"Stark Law,\" prohibits a physician from making referrals for certain\n\"designated health services\" payable by Medicare to an entity, including a company that furnishes DME, in which the physician or\nan immediate family member of such physician has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician has entered\ninto a compensation arrangement, unless a statutory or regulatory exception applies. The majority of states also have statutes or\nregulations similar to the Stark Law, which apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in\nseveral states, apply regardless of payor. Violation of the Stark Law and similar state laws could result in denial of payment,\ndisgorgement of reimbursements received under a noncompliant arrangement, civil penalties, damages and exclusion from\nMedicare or other governmental and state programs. Although we believe that we have structured our provider arrangements to\ncomply with current Stark Law and state equivalent requirements, these requirements are highly technical and there can be no\nguarantee that regulatory authorities will not determine or assert that our arrangements are in violation of the Stark Law and state\nequivalents and do not otherwise meet applicable exceptions.\nThe Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes civil monetary penalties and potential exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs\non any person who offers or transfers remuneration to any patient who is a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary, when the person\nknows or should know that the remuneration is likely to induce the patient to receive medical services from a particular provider.\nThe Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law applies, among other things, to many kinds of inducements or benefits provided to\npatients, including complimentary items, services or transportation that are of more than nominal value. We have structured our\noperations and provision of services to patients in a manner that we believe complies with the law and its interpretation by\ngovernment authorities. We cannot assure you, however, that government authorities will not take a contrary view and impose civil\nmonetary penalties and exclude us from participation in Medicare and Medicaid for past or present practices related to patient\nincentive, coordination of care and need-based programs.\nThe scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare\nreform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of\nthe laws described above or any other government regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and\ncriminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment, restructuring, or restricting of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines,\ncurtailment or restructuring or our operations could harm our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Any action\nagainst us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses\nand divert our management’s attention from operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with\napplicable federal and state fraud laws may prove costly.\nThe implementation of alternative payment models and the transition of Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries to managed\ncare organizations may limit our market share and could adversely affect our revenues.\nMany government and commercial payors are transitioning providers to alternative payment models that are designed to promote\ncost-efficiency, quality and coordination of care. For example, accountable care organizations (“ACOs”) incentivize hospitals,\nphysician groups, and other providers to organize and coordinate patient care while reducing unnecessary costs. Several states\nhave implemented, or plan to implement, accountable care models for their Medicaid populations. We cannot predict how the\ncontinued establishment and implementation of these new business models will impact our business. There is the possibility that\nvalue-based payment models, such as ACOs, will drive down the utilization and/or reimbursement rates for our services. We may\nnot be able to gain access into certain ACOs. If we are not included in these programs, or if ACOs establish programs that overlap\nwith our services, we could experience an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nPage 22\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nWe may be similarly impacted by increased enrollment of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in managed care plans, shifting\naway from traditional fee-for-service models. Under the managed Medicare program, also known as Medicare Advantage, the\nfederal government contracts with private health insurers to provide Medicare benefits. Insurers may choose to offer supplemental\nbenefits and impose higher plan costs on beneficiaries. Approximately one half of Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in a\nMedicare Advantage plan in 2023; a figure that continues to grow. Similarly, enrollment in managed Medicaid plans is also growing,\nas states are increasingly relying on managed care organizations to deliver Medicaid program services as a strategy to control\ncosts and manage resources.\nWe may experience increased competition for managed care contracts due to state regulation and limitations. We cannot assure\nyou that we will be successful in our efforts to be included in plan networks, that we will be able to secure favorable contracts with\nall or some of the managed care organizations, that our reimbursement under these programs will remain at current levels, that\nauthorizations for services will remain at current levels or that our profitability will remain at levels consistent with past performance.\nIn addition, operational processes may not be well defined as a state transitions Medicaid beneficiaries to managed care. For\nexample, membership, new referrals and related authorizations for services may be delayed, which may result in delays in service\ndelivery to consumers or in payment for services rendered. Difficulties with operational processes may negatively affect our\nrevenue growth rates, cash flow and profitability for services provided.\nIn addition, other alternative payment models may be adopted by the government and commercial payors to control costs that\nsubject us to financial risk. We cannot predict at this time what alternative payment models may be presented and what effect such\nnew payment models may have on our operations or financial condition in the future.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern our employment practices, including minimum\nwage, living wage, and paid time-off requirements. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or changes to these\nlaws and regulations that increase our employment-related expenses, could adversely impact our operations.\nWe are required to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to employment, including\noccupational safety and health requirements, wage and hour and other compensation requirements, employee benefits, providing\nleave and sick pay, employment insurance, proper classification of workers as employees or independent contractors, immigration\nand equal employment opportunity laws. These laws and regulations can vary significantly among jurisdictions and can be highly\ntechnical. Costs and expenses related to these requirements are a significant operating expense and may increase as a result of,\namong other things, changes in federal, state or local laws or regulations, or the interpretation thereof, requiring employers to\nprovide specified benefits or rights to employees, increases in the minimum wage and local living wage ordinances, increases in\nthe level of existing benefits or the lengthening of periods for which unemployment benefits are available. We may not be able to\noffset any increased costs and expenses. Furthermore, any failure to comply with these laws requirements, including even a\nseemingly minor infraction, can result in significant penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect\non our business.\nIn addition, certain individuals and entities, known as excluded persons, are prohibited from receiving payment for their services\nrendered to Medicaid, Medicare and other federal and state healthcare program beneficiaries. If we inadvertently hire or contract\nwith an excluded person, or if any of our current employees or contractors becomes an excluded person in the future without our\nknowledge, we may be subject to substantial civil penalties, including up to $20,000 for each item or service furnished by the\nexcluded individual to a federal or state healthcare program beneficiary, an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed\nand exclusion from the program.\nEach of our subsidiaries that employ an average of at least 50 full-time employees in a calendar year are required to offer a\nminimum level of health coverage for 95% of our full-time employees in 2023 or be subject to an annual penalty.\nPage 23\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nRisks Related to our Common Shares\nWe are an \"emerging growth company\" and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \"emerging growth\ncompanies\" may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nAs an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain\ndisclosure requirements. We are an emerging growth company until the earliest of:\n• December 31, 2024, the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the first sale of common equity\nsecurities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act;\n• the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more;\n• the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or\n• the date on which we are deemed a “large accelerated filer” as defined under the federal securities laws.\nFor so long as we remain an “emerging growth company,” we will not be required to:\n• have an auditor report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n• include detailed compensation discussion and analysis in our filings under the Exchange Act and instead may provide a\nreduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation; or\n• hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments\nnot previously approved.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period for\ncomplying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period, which\nallows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards until those standards apply to private companies. As a\nresult of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to public companies that comply with new or revised\naccounting standards.\nThe exact implications of the JOBS Act are still subject to interpretations and guidance by the SEC and other regulatory agencies,\nand we cannot assure you that we will be able to take advantage of all of the benefits of the JOBS Act. In addition, investors may\nfind our common stock less attractive to the extent we rely on the exemptions available to emerging growth companies for so long\nas we qualify as such. If some investors find our common shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading\nmarket for our common shares and our share price may decline or become more volatile.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain proper disclosure or internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial\nstatements and supplemental information, or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs we grow, we may be subject to growth-related risks including capacity constraints and pressure on our internal systems and\ncontrols. Our ability to manage growth effectively will require us to continue to implement and improve our operational and financial\nsystems and to expend, train and manage our employee base.\nWe must maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures. We must also maintain effective internal control over financial\nreporting or, at the appropriate time, our independent auditors will be unwilling or unable to provide us with an unqualified report on\nthe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we fail\nto maintain effective controls, investors may lose confidence in our operating results, the price of our common shares could decline\nand we may be subject to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions.\nThe market price for our common shares may experience substantial volatility for reasons unrelated to our financial\nperformance. This volatility may impact the price at which shareholders can sell their common shares.\nOur common shares are listed and posted for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Securities of small-cap and healthcare\ncompanies have experienced substantial volatility in the past, often based on factors unrelated to the financial performance or\nprospects of the companies involved. These factors include macroeconomic developments in North America and globally, and\nmarket perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries. The price of our common shares is also likely to be significantly\naffected by short-term changes in the cost of goods, or in financial condition or results of our operations. Other factors unrelated to\nour performance that may have an effect on the price of our common shares include the following: the extent of analytical coverage\navailable to investors concerning our business may be limited if investment banks with research capabilities do not follow our\nsecurities; lessening in trading volume and general market interest in our securities may affect an investor’s ability to trade\nsignificant numbers of our common shares; the size of our public float may limit the ability of some institutions to invest in our\nsecurities; and a substantial decline in the price of our common shares that persists for a significant period of time could cause our\nsecurities, if listed on an exchange, to be delisted from such exchange, further reducing market liquidity.\nPage 24\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nAs a result of any of these factors, the market price of our common shares at any given point in time may not accurately reflect our\nlong-term value. Securities class-action litigation often has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the\nmarket price of their securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial\ncosts and damages and divert management’s attention and resources.\nThe failure of our common shares to be included in various stock indices could result in the market for our common\nshares to become limited and volatile and the price at which you can sell your shares to decrease.\nYour ability to sell or purchase our common shares depends upon the existence of an active trading market for our common\nshares. Additionally, a fair valuation of the purchase or sales price of our common shares also depends upon an active trading\nmarket, and thus the price you receive for a thinly-traded stock may not reflect its true value. A limited trading market for common\nshares may cause fluctuations in the market value of those common shares to be exaggerated, leading to price volatility in excess\nof that which would occur in a more active trading market.\nAlthough our common shares are quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the volume of trades on any given day has historically\nbeen limited. As a result, shareholders might not have been able to sell or purchase our common shares at the volume, price or\ntime desired. If our common shares are removed from various stock indices, the volume of trading in our shares may decrease\nmaterially as well as the prices at which our shares trade.\nFuture sales of our common shares in the public market could reduce our share price, and any additional capital raised\nby us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute the ownership of existing shareholders.\nWe will require additional funds in order to finance the further development of our business, which funds could be raised by, among\nother things, the issuance and sale of common shares. Sales of substantial amounts of our common shares (including shares\nissued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market\nprices of our common shares. The perception in the public market that major shareholders might sell substantial amounts of our\ncommon shares could also depress the market price of our common shares.\nIn the future, we may attempt to obtain financing or further increase our capital resources by issuing additional shares of our\ncommon shares or by offering debt or other equity securities, including senior or subordinated notes, debt securities convertible\ninto equity or shares of preferred stock. Issuing additional common shares or other equity securities or securities convertible into\nequity may dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common shares or\nboth. Upon liquidation, holders of such debt securities and preferred shares, if issued, and lenders with respect to other borrowings\nwould receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common shares. Debt securities convertible into\nequity could be subject to adjustments in the conversion ratio pursuant to which certain events may increase the number of equity\nsecurities issuable upon conversion. Preferred shares, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or\na preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common shares.\nOur decision to issue securities in any future offering will, in part, depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our\ncontrol, which may adversely affect the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common shares bear\nthe risk that future offerings may reduce the market price of our common shares and dilute their shareholdings. We cannot predict\nthe size of future issuances of our common shares or securities convertible into common shares or the effect, if any, that future\nissuances and sales of shares of our common shares will have on the market price of our common shares.\nWe will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a U.S. public reporting company, and our management is\nrequired to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a U.S. public reporting company, we will incur, particularly after we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” significant\nlegal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the\nSEC and NASDAQ have imposed various requirements on U.S. public companies, including establishment and maintenance of\neffective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. We may have to hire additional accounting, finance,\nand other personnel in connection with our efforts to comply with the requirements of being a U.S. public reporting company, and\nour management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time towards maintaining compliance with these\nrequirements. These requirements increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-\nconsuming and costly.\nPage 25\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nWe no longer qualify as a “smaller reporting company” and, subject to certain exemptions and relief from various\nreporting requirements that are applicable to emerging growth companies, we will be required to comply with larger\ncompany disclosure obligations beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March\n31, 2024, which may increase our costs and demands on management.\nAs of June 30, 2023, we determined that we no longer qualify as a “smaller reporting company” and, subject to certain exemptions\nand relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to emerging growth companies, we will be required to comply\nwith larger company disclosure obligations beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March\n31, 2024. The loss of smaller reporting company status and compliance with such larger company disclosure obligations (subject to\ncertain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to emerging growth companies) may increase\nour legal and financial compliance costs and cause management and other personnel to divert attention from operational and other\nbusiness matters to devote additional time to public company reporting requirements. In addition, if we are not able to comply with\nchanging requirements in a timely manner, the market price of our common shares could decline and we could be subject to\nsanctions or investigations by the stock exchanges on which our common shares are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities,\nwhich would require additional financial and management resources.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common shares, investors may not receive any return on\ntheir investment unless the value of our common shares appreciates.\nWe may retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and have no\ncurrent plans to pay any cash dividends on our common shares. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of\ncash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors (the “Board”) and will depend on then-existing conditions, including\nour financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and other factors\nthat the Board considers relevant. Accordingly, investors may only see a return on their investment if the value of our common\nshares appreciates.\nCanadian laws differ from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our\nsecurities.\nWe are a Canadian corporation and are subject to the Business Corporations Act and certain other applicable securities laws as a\nCanadian issuer, which laws may differ from those governing a company formed under the laws of a United States jurisdiction. The\nprovisions under Business Corporations Act and other relevant laws may affect the rights of shareholders differently than those of a\ncompany governed by the laws of a United States jurisdiction, and may, together with our notice of articles and articles (the\n“Articles”), have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging another party from acquiring control of our company by means of a\ntender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise, or may affect the price an acquiring party would be willing to offer in such an instance.\nPage 26\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe have implemented robust processes and policies dedicated to assessing, identifying, and effectively managing material risks\nassociated with cybersecurity threats. Our cybersecurity program is designed and evaluated based on recognized frameworks such\nas the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Center for Internet Security. These frameworks guide our focus on:\n(i) cultivating organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risks, (ii) implementing safeguards to fortify our systems, (iii)\npromptly detecting cybersecurity incidents, (iv) responding effectively to incidents, and (v) ensuring a swift recovery from any\ncybersecurity event. Where appropriate, these processes and policies are seamlessly integrated into our overarching risk\nmanagement systems.\nWe strive to continually improve our information technology systems, and we prioritize enhancing our defenses through employee\nawareness training, specifically targeting areas such as phishing, malware, and other cyber risks. To reinforce our cybersecurity\nposture, we enlist independent consultants and third-party experts to assist in the establishment and enhancement of our\ncybersecurity program. Regular tabletop exercises, conducted at least annually, test the effectiveness of our processes, with senior\nmanagement actively participating. Valuable insights gained from these exercises are incorporated to refine and bolster our\ncybersecurity measures.\nIdentification of critical third-party relationships vulnerable to cybersecurity threats is an integral part of our risk management\nprogram. Upon identification, we conduct thorough due diligence to fortify these relationships. Our comprehensive insurance\nportfolio includes cybersecurity insurance to provide an additional layer of protection.\nFor further insights into the cybersecurity risks we confront, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors – \"We rely significantly on\ninformation technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity\nincidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively\".\nGovernance\nThe Board oversees our risk management process, including cybersecurity risks, directly and through its committees. The\nCorporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board is responsible for the oversight of cybersecurity-related risks and\nregularly receives quarterly reports from management on our cybersecurity threat risk management and strategy processes. The\nCorporate Governance and Nominating Committee reviews issues concerning our data security posture, results from third-party\nassessments, progress towards pre-determined risk-mitigation-related goals, incident response plans, and cybersecurity threat\nrisks or incidents and developments, as well as the steps management has taken to respond to these risks.\nOur information systems management team, comprising the Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Technology Officer (CTO), and\nDirector of Information Security, collectively possesses over 50 years of extensive experience in Information Technology and\ncybersecurity. Prior to their current roles with the Company, our CIO, CTO, and Director of Information Security held various\ninformation technology and cybersecurity positions with other healthcare services and healthcare technology companies. They\nhave collectively obtained various industry-recognized certifications, including the Certified Security Compliance Specialist,\nCertified Cyber Security Architect, and Certified HIPAA Professional designations. The Director of Information Security holds the\nposition of the Information Security Officer and directs cybersecurity operations. To enhance governance and oversight, we have\nestablished a Security Oversight Committee, chaired by the Information Security Officer and joined by key stakeholders such as\nour Chief Information Officer and General Counsel. This committee convenes regularly, typically on a weekly basis, to foster\nalignment and cooperation on security-related issues.\nWe have adopted a comprehensive Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan to direct our responses to cybersecurity events in a\nprompt, effective, and well-coordinated manner. The plan designates a primary manager for each incident and outlines the\ncommunication processes, containment strategies, eradication measures, and recovery protocols. Depending on the severity of a\ncybersecurity incident, senior management and the Board are promptly notified and kept informed of mitigation and remediation\nefforts.\nWe have not identified any risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that\nhave materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our operations, business strategy, regulatory compliance,\nresults of operations, or financial condition.\nPage 27\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nItem 2.

We also own and occupy a 16,000 square foot office building and a 16,000 square foot climate controlled\nwarehouse located in Lafayette, Louisiana. We believe that our facilities are adequate for our needs for the immediate future and\nthat, should it be needed, additional space can be leased on commercially reasonable terms to accommodate any future growth.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to various ongoing or threatened legal actions and other proceedings, including those that\narise in the ordinary course of business, which may include employment matters, breach of contract disputes, as well as\ngovernmental and regulatory matters. Please read Note 9 to the Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for more information.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our\nfinancial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report. The forward-looking statements include\nstatements that reflect management’s beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, anticipations and intentions with respect to our\nfuture development plans, capital resources and requirements, results of operations, and future business performance. Our actual\nresults could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements included in this discussion as a result of\ncertain factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed in the section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements” immediately preceding Part I of this report.\nGeneral Matters\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" and \"our\" refer to\nViemed Healthcare, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nWe were incorporated on December 14, 2016 pursuant to the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). As of June 30, 2020,\nwe determined that we no longer qualify as a \"foreign private issuer,\" as defined in Rule 3b-4 of the Exchange Act, for the purposes\nof the informational requirements of the Exchange Act. As a result, effective January 1, 2021, we became subject to the proxy\nsolicitation rules under Section 14 of the Exchange Act and Regulation FD, and our officers, directors, and principal shareholders\nbecame subject to the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. We will\ncontinue to file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K with the SEC and\nwith the relevant Canadian securities regulatory authorities on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval\n(SEDAR).\nAs of June 30, 2023, we determined that we no longer qualify as a “smaller reporting company,” but we are not required to comply\nwith the larger company disclosure obligations (subject to certain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that\nare applicable to emerging growth companies) until our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31,\n2024. As a result, this Annual Report on Form 10-K is only required to comply with the smaller company disclosure obligations.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the JOBS Act, and as such, we have elected to comply with certain reduced\nU.S. public company reporting requirements.\nOverview\nWe provide an array of home medical equipment, services and supplies, specializing in post-acute respiratory care services in the\nUnited States. Our primary objective is to focus on the organic growth of the business and thereby solidify our position as one of\nthe United States’ largest providers of in-home therapy for patients suffering from respiratory diseases. Our respiratory care\nprograms are designed specifically for payors to have the ability to treat patients in the home for less total cost and with a superior\nquality of care. Our services include respiratory disease management (through the rental of various HME devices), neuromuscular\ncare, in-home sleep testing and sleep apnea treatment, oxygen therapy, and the sale of associated supplies.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue through the rental of non-invasive and invasive ventilators which represented 59.2% and\n67.9% of our traditional revenue, excluding COVID-19 response sales and services for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively. We combine the benefits of home ventilation support with licensed RTs to drive improved patient outcomes and\nreduce costly hospital readmissions.\nWe expect to grow through expansion of existing service areas as well as in new territories through a cost efficient launch that\nreduces location expenses. We currently serve patients in all 50 states. We expect to continue to employ more RTs in order to\nassure our high service model is accomplished in the home. As of December 31, 2023, we employed 372 licensed RTs,\nrepresenting approximately 37% of our company-wide employee count. By focusing overhead costs on personnel that service the\npatient rather than physical location costs, we anticipate that we will efficiently scale our business in regions that are currently not\nbeing effectively serviced.\nThe continued trend of servicing patients in the home rather than in hospitals is aligned with our business objective and we\nanticipate that this trend will continue to offer growth opportunities for us. We expect to continue to be a solution to the rising health\ncosts in the United States by offering more cost effective, home based solutions while increasing the quality of life for patients\nfighting serious respiratory diseases.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we generated revenues of $183.0 million and had net income of $10.2 million, compared\nto revenues of $138.8 million and net income of $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Excluding COVID-19 response\nsales and services, net revenue increased $46.5 million (or 34.0%) from the comparable period in 2022.\nPage 30\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nOur primary sources of capital to date have been from operating cash flows. Our existing commercial credit facilities provide\naccess to additional liquidity through a revolving credit facility of up to $30.0 million and a delayed draw term loan facility of up to\n$30.0 million. An accordion feature allows the Company to increase the size of such facilities by up to an additional $30.0 million,\nsubject to certain conditions, for a total borrowing capacity of up to $90 million.\nTrends Affecting our Business\nHome medical equipment markets are witnessing sustained expansion, with a notable focus on the complex respiratory and\nObstructive Sleep Apnea (\"OSA\") device segments. Analysts in the industry anticipate a consistent and robust growth trajectory,\nprojecting Compound Annual Growth Rates (\"CAGR\") of approximately 6% for respiratory devices and 8% for OSA devices. This\nupward trend underscores the increasing demand for innovative solutions in respiratory care and sleep apnea management,\nhighlighting the industry's responsiveness to evolving healthcare needs. As technological advancements and awareness drive the\nadoption of these specialized devices, we believe the HME markets, particularly in respiratory and OSA, are positioned for\ncontinuous expansion, offering promising opportunities for both providers and consumers alike.\nThe aging population remains a pivotal driver for the industry, as the elderly, constituting a substantial portion of HME patients, are\nexpected to represent a higher percentage of the overall population. Projections from industry analysts indicate a consistent annual\ngrowth in the number of Medicare beneficiaries, contributing to ongoing patient volume growth. A significant contributing factor to\nthe industry's growth is the rising incidence of chronic diseases. Factors such as increasing obesity rates, consequences of past\nsmoking prevalence, under-diagnosis of certain health conditions, and higher diagnosis rates for chronic diseases collectively\nshape the industry. There is a notable shift towards home-based treatment for these conditions.\nThe industry is undergoing a transition to value-based healthcare, with both government and commercial payors increasingly\nadopting models that emphasize the transition of patients from acute care settings to home care. We believe HME providers are\nwell-positioned to benefit from this industry shift. Advancements in technology and medical equipment have led to an increased\nprevalence of in-home treatments. The broader range of treatments administered in patient homes is expected to continue growing.\nProjections from industry analysts indicate that U.S. home healthcare spending will increase, reaching $250 billion by 2031, with a\nCAGR of approximately 7%.\nMarket consolidation is a notable trend favoring larger, financially stable players. The decline in the number of smaller regional\nplayers is attributed to the capital investment and scale required to compete effectively. This has led to a more consolidated and\ncompetitive landscape in the DME market.\nDespite these positive trends, the industry faces challenges such as cost containment efforts of payors. The consolidation of\nmanaged care payors into larger purchasing groups has increased negotiating power, resulting in pricing pressure on HME\nproviders. In addition to ongoing negotiations contract management with third party payors to secure fair reimbursement, HME\nproviders are engaging in value-based contracting, focusing on outcomes and patient satisfaction. These value-based contracts\nleverage data analytics to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and quality of durable medical goods and provide evidence-based\ndata to payors demonstrating the long-term benefits and cost savings associated with the use of certain medical goods.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe Company faces current and potential future inflationary pressures driven by factors such as general cost increases, supply\nchain disruptions, and governmental policies. The manufacturing and distribution costs of Viemed's patient equipment are affected\nby rising material, labor, and transportation expenses, including fuel costs. Persistent inflation may impact overall demand, increase\noperating costs, and affect profit margins, potentially adversely affecting Viemed's business and financial performance.\nIn its 2024 DMEPOS Fee Schedule, CMS announced the fee schedule adjustment based on the annual change to the Consumer\nPricing Index for all urban areas. Items that were subject to the competitive bidding program in former competitive bidding areas\nwill receive a 2.9% reimbursement rate increase. Items that were subject to the competitive bidding program in non-competitive\nbidding areas received a 3.0% reimbursement rate increase. Items not subject to the competitive bidding program received a 2.6%\nreimbursement rate increase.\nFuture volatility in general price inflation and its impact on material availability, shipping, warehousing, and operational overhead\ncould further impact financial results. Viemed attempts to address these pressures through its inflation-linked reimbursement\ncontracts, negotiation, leveraging its purchasing power and embracing technology, such as its proprietary clinical management\nplatform.\nPage 31\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe below table highlights summary financial and operational metrics for the last eight quarters.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except vent patients)\nDecember 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31,\nFor the quarter ended 2023 2023 2023 2023 2022 2022 2022 2022\nFinancial Information:\nRevenue $ 50,739 $ 49,402 $ 43,311 $ 39,556 $ 37,508 $ 35,759 $ 33,310 $ 32,255\nGross Profit 32,111 30,562 26,106 24,004 22,896 21,651 20,390 19,743\nGross Profit % 63 % 62 % 60 % 61 % 61 % 61 % 61 % 61 %\nNet Income 3,477 2,919 2,330 1,517 2,438 1,055 967 1,762\nCash and Cash Equivalents (As of) 12,839 10,078 10,224 23,544 16,914 21,478 21,922 29,248\nTotal Assets (As of) 154,895 149,400 149,117 124,634 117,043 119,419 115,904 119,007\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) 12,845 12,081 9,810 8,328 9,306 6,982 6,458 7,273\nOperational Information:\nVent Patients(2) 10,327 10,244 10,005 9,337 9,306 9,127 8,837 8,434\n(1) Refer to \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section below for definition of Adjusted EBITDA.\n(2) Vent Patients represents the number of active ventilator patients on recurring billing service at the end of each calendar quarter.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe are required to disclose “critical accounting estimates” which are estimates made in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and that have had or are reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the registrant.\nWe follow financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States. The more significant of these policies are summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in\nPart II, Item 8 of this report. Not all significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex\njudgments. However, the policies noted below could be deemed to meet the SEC’s definition of a critical accounting estimate.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are presented at net realizable values that reflect the consideration we expect to receive which is inclusive of\nadjustments for price concessions. Due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate,\ncertain estimates are required in order to record revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Management’s\nevaluation takes into consideration such factors as historical realization data, including current and historical cash collections,\naccounts receivable aging trends, other operating trends and relevant business conditions.\nInherent in these estimates is the risk that they may have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. It\nis possible that management’s estimates could change, which could have an impact on operations and cash flows. Specifically, the\ncomplexity of many third-party billing arrangements, patient qualification for medical necessity of equipment and the uncertainty of\nreimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. If the\npayment amount received differs from the estimated net realizable amount, an adjustment is made to the net realizable amount in\nthe period that these payment differences are determined.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business acquisitions. The results of operations of the businesses\nacquired by the Company are included as of the respective acquisition date. The acquisition-date fair value of the consideration\ntransferred, including the fair value of any contingent consideration, is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. To the extent the acquisition-date fair value of the\nconsideration transferred exceeds the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed,\nsuch excess is allocated to goodwill. Patient relationships, medical records and patient lists are not reported as separate intangible\nassets due to the regulatory requirements and lack of contractual agreements, but are part of goodwill. Customer related\nrelationships are not reported as separate intangible assets, but are also part of goodwill as authorizing physicians are under no\nobligation to refer the Company’s services to their patients, who are free to change physicians and service providers at any time.\nThe Company may adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, as it obtains more information regarding asset\nvaluations and liabilities assumed that existed but were not available at the acquisition date, which is generally up to one year after\nthe acquisition closing date. Acquisition related costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed\nas incurred.\nPage 32\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended December 31,\n% of Total % of Total $ %\n2023 Revenue 2022 Revenue Change Change\nRevenue $ 183,008 100.0 % $ 138,832 100.0 % $ 44,176 31.8 %\nCost of revenue 70,225 38.4 % 54,152 39.0 % 16,073 29.7 %\nGross profit 112,783 61.6 % 84,680 61.0 % 28,103 33.2 %\nSelling, general and administrative 87,884 48.0 % 68,161 49.1 % 19,723 28.9 %\nResearch and development 2,782 1.5 % 2,696 1.9 % 86 3.2 %\nStock-based compensation 5,849 3.2 % 5,202 3.7 % 647 12.4 %\nDepreciation and amortization 1,391 0.8 % 1,012 0.7 % 379 37.5 %\nLoss on disposal of property and equipment 645 0.4 % 346 0.2 % 299 86.4 %\nOther income, net (98) (0.1) % (989) (0.7) % 891 (90.1) %\nIncome from operations 14,330 7.8 % 8,252 5.9 % 6,078 73.7 %\nNon-operating income and expenses\nIncome from equity method investments 485 0.3 % 935 0.7 % (450) (48.1) %\nInterest expense, net (424) (0.2) % (197) (0.1) % (227) 115.2 %\nNet income before taxes 14,391 7.9 % 8,990 6.5 % 5,401 60.1 %\nProvision for income taxes 4,148 2.3 % 2,768 2.0 % 1,380 49.9 %\nNet income $ 10,243 5.6 % $ 6,222 4.5 % $ 4,021 64.6 %\nRevenue\nThe following table summarizes our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended December 31,\n% of Total % of Total $ %\n2023 Revenue 2022 Revenue Change Change\nNet revenue from rentals\nVentilator rentals, non-invasive and invasive $ 108,258 59.2 % $ 92,710 66.8 % $ 15,548 16.8 %\nOther home medical equipment rentals 38,315 20.9 % 21,446 15.4 % 16,869 78.7 %\nNet revenue from sales and services\nEquipment and supply sales 25,770 14.1 % 13,927 10.0 % 11,843 85.0 %\nCOVID-19 response sales and services — — % 2,278 1.6 % (2,278) (100.0) %\nService revenues 10,665 5.8 % 8,471 6.1 % 2,194 25.9 %\nTotal net revenue $ 183,008 100.0 % $ 138,832 100.0 % $ 44,176 31.8 %\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, revenue totaled $183.0 million, an increase of $44.2 million (or 31.8%) from the\ncomparable period in 2022. Excluding COVID-19 response sales and services, net revenue increased $46.5 million (or 34.0%)\nfrom the comparable period in 2022. The net revenue increase was comprised of increases in ventilator rental revenue of $15.5\nmillion (or 16.8%), rental revenue from other HME of $16.9 million (or 78.7%), equipment and supply sales of $11.8 million (or\n85.0%), and service revenues of $2.2 million (or 25.9%). The growth in other home medical equipment rentals has been primarily\ndriven by the continued national expansion of PAP, oxygen therapy, and percussion vest activities and the acquisition of Home\nMedical Products, Inc. (\"HMP\"). The increase in equipment sales and supplies is primarily driven by the success of our PAP\nresupply program and other sleep offerings.\nThe increase in service revenue is primarily due to the addition of our healthcare staffing offerings. While ventilator rentals continue\nto make up the majority of our revenue, the organic and acquired growth of PAP and oxygen related sales and services, as well as\nour healthcare staffing offerings, is contributing significantly to the diversity of our overall revenue mix. As we continue to expand\ngeographically into new territories and further expand our presence in our existing territories, we expect continued growth in our\nactive ventilator patient base and our other respiratory offerings.\nPage 33\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, cost of revenue totaled $70.2 million, an increase of $16.1 million (or 29.7%) from the\ncomparable period in 2022. Gross profit percentage increased from approximately 61.0% to approximately 61.6% from the year\nended December 31, 2022 to year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in gross profit percentage is primarily\nattributable to the migration of our revenue mix, which reflects our deliberate efforts towards product and service diversification,\naimed at further enhancing our market position. Gross profit percentage is expected to remain relatively stable in upcoming periods\ndue to subsiding inflationary cost pressures and the positive effects associated with reimbursement rates, offset by some\ndecreases associated with product and service diversification.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 48.0% for the year ended December 31,\n2023 compared to 49.1% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $87.9\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $19.7 million (or 28.9%) from the comparable period in 2022. The\noverall increase in selling, general and administrative expense as compared to the prior period is primarily due to additional\nemployee related expenses to accommodate the overall growth of the Company and transaction costs related to the acquisition of\nHMP. Our full time employee count increased from 743 on December 31, 2022 to 996 on December 31, 2023, an increase of 34%,\nwhich was partially due to the acquisition of HMP on June 1, 2023. Employee compensation expenses increased $10.4 million (or\n27%) as a result of the increase in our employee headcount and increases in incentive and volume based compensation. We\nexpect that selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will continue to improve in 2024 due to\nincreased efficiencies and costs stabilization relative to revenue growth.\nResearch and Development Costs\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, research and development costs totaled $2.8 million, an increase of $0.1 million (or 3.2%)\nfrom the comparable period in 2022. As we continue to invest in research and development related projects to support our\ntechnology initiatives, we expect that the associated costs will remain consistent in 2024 relative to 2023 costs.\nStock-Based Compensation\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, stock-based compensation totaled $5.8 million, an increase of $0.6 million (or 12.4%) from\nthe comparable period in 2022. This increase is attributed to the expense of additional stock-based awards during 2023. We\nanticipate that as we expand our workforce, incorporating stock-based awards as a component of employee compensation, stock-\nbased compensation expenses will correspondingly rise. Historically, revenue growth has outpaced the growth in stock-based\ncompensation, and as a result, the percentage of stock-based compensation relative to revenue is expected to continue declining.\nInterest Expense, Net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net interest expense totaled $0.4 million, an increase of $0.2 million from the comparable\nperiod in 2022. As a result of continued paydowns on debt issued to fund the acquisition of HMP, we expect net interest expense to\ndecrease in 2024 relative to 2023.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the provision for income taxes was a $4.1 million expense, compared to a $2.8 million\nexpense during the 2022 period. Our annual estimated effective tax rate for 2023 is 28.8%.\nNet Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net income was $10.2 million, an increase of $4.0 million (or 64.6%) from the comparable\nperiod in 2022. Net income as a percentage of net revenue increased from 4.5% for the year ended December 31, 2022 to 5.6%\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to improvements in selling, general, and administrative expenses associated\nwith increased efficiencies and stabilizing costs.\nPage 34\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company uses Adjusted EBITDA, which is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") to analyze its financial results and believes that it is useful to investors, as a\nsupplement to GAAP measures. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information with respect to the\nCompany’s operating performance as viewed by management, including a view of the Company’s business that is not dependent\non the impact of the Company’s capitalization structure and items that are not part of the Company’s day-to-day operations.\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA (i) to compare the Company’s operating performance on a consistent basis, (ii) to calculate\nincentive compensation for the Company’s employees, (iii) for planning purposes, including the preparation of the Company’s\ninternal annual operating budget, and (iv) to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the Company’s operational strategies.\nAccordingly, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in understanding and evaluating the\nCompany’s operating performance in the same manner as management. In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, certain items (mostly\nnon-cash) are excluded from net income including net interest expense (income), taxes, stock based compensation, depreciation of\nproperty and equipment, and amortization of intangible assets. Beginning with financial results reported for periods in fiscal year\n2023, Adjusted EBITDA also excludes transaction costs and expenses related to acquisition and integration efforts associated with\nrecently announced or completed acquisitions. This modification enables investors to compare period-over-period results on a\nmore consistent basis without the effects of acquisitions. We have recast Adjusted EBITDA for prior periods when reported to\nconform to the modified presentation.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of Net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, on a\nhistorical basis for the periods indicated:\nDecember 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31,\nFor the quarter ended 2023 2023 2023 2023 2022 2022 2022 2022\nNet Income $ 3,477 $ 2,919 $ 2,330 $ 1,517 $ 2,438 $ 1,055 $ 967 $ 1,762\nAdd back:\nDepreciation & amortization 5,918 5,975 5,207 4,762 4,373 4,120 3,740 3,397\nInterest expense (income) 256 237 (20) (49) 32 42 59 64\nStock-based compensation(a) 1,534 1,453 1,471 1,391 1,317 1,309 1,271 1,305\nTransaction costs(b) 61 177 94 206 — — — —\nIncome tax expense 1,599 1,320 728 501 1,146 456 421 745\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 12,845 $ 12,081 $ 9,810 $ 8,328 $ 9,306 $ 6,982 $ 6,458 $ 7,273\n(a) Represents non-cash, equity-based compensation expense associated with option and RSU awards.\n(b) Represents transaction costs and expenses related to acquisition and integration efforts associated with recently announced or\ncompleted acquisitions.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in\naccordance with GAAP. It is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an\nalternative to revenue or net income, as applicable, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an\nalternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of the Company's liquidity, and may not be comparable to other\nsimilarly titled measures of other companies or businesses. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA does not\nreflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of ongoing operations; and other\ncompanies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023 was $12.8 million, compared to $16.9 million at December 31, 2022. The\nprimary non-recurring use of excess cash during the 2023 period was to fund the acquisition of HMP. Based on our current plan of\noperations, we believe this amount, when combined with expected cash flows from operations and amounts available under our\n2022 Senior Credit Facilities will be sufficient to fund our growth strategy and to meet our anticipated operating expenses, capital\nexpenditures, and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months from the date of this filing. The Company has also\nhistorically utilized short term financing arrangements with suppliers that could be extended over a longer term if there was a need\nfor additional liquidity.\nPage 35\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet Cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 45,212 $ 27,748\nInvesting activities (52,113) (23,976)\nFinancing activities 2,826 (15,266)\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (4,075) $ (11,494)\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $45.2 million, resulting from net income of\n$10.2 million, increased by net income adjustments of $27.2 million and a change in net working capital of $7.8 million. The net\nincome adjustments primarily consisted of $21.9 million of depreciation and amortization, $5.8 million of stock-based\ncompensation, and $1.0 million of distributions of earnings received from equity method investments, offset by a $1.4 million\ndeferred income tax benefit. The primary changes in working capital were an increase in accrued liabilities of $5.0 million, a\ndecrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.2 million, and a net increase in income taxes payable of $2.2 million, offset by\nan increase in net accounts receivable of $1.1 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 was $27.7 million, resulting from net income of\n$6.2 million, increased by net income adjustments of $21.7 million and a change in net working capital of $0.1 million.

Purchases of property and equipment during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 were primarily related to medical equipment rented to our patients. Cash purchases of property and equipment\nrepresents a $3.2 million, or 14.0%, increase year over year.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 was $24.0 million, consisting of $22.9 million of\npurchases of property and equipment, $2.0 million in debt investments, and $0.1 million in equity investments, partially offset by\n$1.1 million of sales proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment. Purchases of property and equipment during the year\nended December 31, 2022 were primarily related to medical equipment rented to our patients.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $2.8 million. Proceeds from the 2022 Term\nLoan Facility (as defined below) were $5.0 million and proceeds from the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) were\n$8.0 million, which were used to partially fund the cash acquisition of HMP. During the year ended December 31, 2023, principal\npayments on the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities (as defined below) were $6.1 million. Additionally, principal payments on acquired\nloans were $4.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company acquired and cancelled 75,235 common shares\nat a cost of $0.6 million to satisfy employee income tax withholding associated with RSUs vestings while proceeds from the\nexercise of options during the year ended December 31, 2023 were $1.3 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 was $15.3 million, consisting of 1,794,163\nrepurchased and canceled common shares at a cost of $9.6 million pursuant to the share repurchase program authorized by the\nBoard on March 7, 2022 and terminated on September 30, 2023 (the \"2022 Share Repurchase Program\"), $1.3 million in principal\npayments on the term note under the prior Commercial Business Loan Agreement with Hancock Whitney Bank (the “Term Note”),\n$4.5 million in principal payments on the building term note under the prior Commercial Business Loan Agreement with Hancock\nWhitney Bank (the \"Building Term Note\"), and $0.1 million for shares repurchased and canceled for tax withholding in connection\nwith RSUs vested in the period, partially offset by $0.3 million proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nPage 36\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nSenior Credit Facilities\nOn November 29, 2022, the Company refinanced its existing borrowings under the prior Commercial Business Loan Agreement\nwith Hancock Whitney Bank and entered into a new credit agreement (the \"2022 Senior Credit Facilities\") with the lenders from\ntime to time party thereto, and Regions Bank, as administrative agent and collateral agent that provides for an up to $30.0 million\nrevolving credit facility (the \"2022 Revolving Credit Facility\") and an up to $30.0 million delayed draw term loan facility (the \"2022\nTerm Loan Facility\"), both maturing in November 2027.\nThe proceeds of the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility may be used to refinance existing indebtedness, for working capital purposes,\ncapital expenditures and other general corporate purposes (including permitted acquisitions), and to pay transaction fees, costs\nand expenses related to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities. The proceeds of the 2022 Term Loan Facility and any additional term\nloans established in accordance with the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities may be used to finance permitted acquisitions and to pay\ntransaction fees, costs and expenses related to such acquisitions. Outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Term Loan Facility and\n2022 Revolving Credit Facility were $4.9 million and $2.0 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023.\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are Term SOFR (as defined in the 2022 Senior Credit\nFacilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 2.625% to 3.375%, or, at the option of the Company, a Base Rate (as\ndefined in the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 1.625% to 2.375%.\nThe 2022 Senior Credit Facilities require the Company to comply with certain affirmative, as well as certain negative covenants\nthat, among other things, will restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur indebtedness, grant liens,\nmake investments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations and pay dividends and other restricted payments. The 2022\nSenior Credit Facilities also include certain financial covenants, which generally include, but are not limited to the following:\n• Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (defined generally as total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than (i) for\nany fiscal quarter ending during the period from the closing date to and including December 31, 2024, 2.75 to 1.0 and (ii)\nfor any fiscal quarter ending on and after March 31, 2025, 2.50 to 1.0, subject to certain adjustments following a material\nacquisition.\n• Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (defined generally as (a) adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditures minus\ncash taxes to (b) the sum of scheduled principal payments plus cash interest expense plus restricted payments) of not\nless than 1.25:1.0.\nThe Company was in compliance with all covenants under the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities in effect at December 31, 2023.\nSources of Funds\nCash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $45.2 million compared to $27.7 million\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $12.8 million.\nUse of Funds\nOur principal uses of cash are funding the purchase of rental assets and other capital purchases, the repayment of debt, funding of\nacquisitions, operations, and other working capital requirements. Our contractual obligations primarily relate to the repayment of\nexisting debt and contractual obligations for operating and finance leases. The following table presents our material contractual\nobligations and commitments to make future payments as of December 31, 2023:\nWithin 12 Months Beyond 12 Months\nDebt Obligations, including interest $ 1,617 $ 7,911\nLease Obligations 1,130 2,666\nTotal $ 2,747 $ 10,577\nExcept for the funding of potential acquisitions and investments, we anticipate that our operating cash flows will satisfy our material\ncash requirements for the 12 months after December 31, 2023. In addition to our operating cash flows, we may need to raise\nadditional funds to support our contractual obligations and investing activities beyond such 12 month period, and such funding may\nnot be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, our operations and\nability to execute our business strategy could be adversely affected. We may seek to raise additional funds through equity, equity-\nPage 37\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nlinked or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness would have rights\nthat are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. Any additional equity\nfinancing may be dilutive to our stockholders.\nLeases\nLeases under which we assume substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon initial\nrecognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lesser of its fair value and the present value of the minimum\nlease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to\nthe asset. The associated lease liability is drawn down over the life of the lease by allocating a portion of each lease payment to the\nliability with the remainder being recognized as finance charges. Leases that do not transfer the risks and rewards of ownership to\nthe Company are treated as operating leases and are expensed as incurred.\nRetirement Plan\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) retirement plan for employees to which eligible employees can contribute a percentage of their\npre-tax compensation. Matching employer contributions to the 401(k) plan totaled $1.4 million and $1.1 million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has no material undisclosed off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or\nfuture effect on its results of operations or financial condition.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of\nrecently issued accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of\noperations, financial positions and cash flows.\nItem 7A.

(the Company) as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity and\ncash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the\n“consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\nfinancial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of\nthe two years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial\nreporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we\nexpress no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2019.\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\nMarch 6, 2024\nPage F-2\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except outstanding shares)\nAt At\nNote December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents 2 $ 12,839 $ 16,914\nAccounts receivable, net 2 18,451 15,379\nInventory 2 4,628 3,574\nIncome tax receivable — 26\nPrepaid expenses and other assets 2,449 3,849\nTotal current assets $ 38,367 $ 39,742\nLong-term assets\nProperty and equipment, net 4 73,579 67,743\nFinance lease right-of-use assets 401 —\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 2,872 694\nEquity investments 2 1,680 2,155\nDebt investment 2 2,219 2,000\nDeferred tax asset 10 4,558 3,119\nIdentifiable intangibles, net 567 —\nGoodwill 3 29,765 —\nOther long-term assets 9 887 1,590\nTotal long-term assets $ 116,528 $ 77,301\nTOTAL ASSETS $ 154,895 $ 117,043\nLIABILITIES\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade payables $ 4,180 $ 2,650\nDeferred revenue 6,207 4,624\nIncome taxes payable 2,153 —\nAccrued liabilities 5 17,578 11,092\nFinance lease liabilities, current portion 256 —\nOperating lease liabilities, current portion 6 678 495\nCurrent debt 6 1,072 —\nTotal current liabilities $ 32,124 $ 18,861\nLong-term liabilities\nAccrued liabilities 8 558 889\nFinance lease liabilities, less current portion 132 —\nOperating lease liabilities, less current portion 6 2,184 199\nLong-term debt 6 6,002 —\nTotal long-term liabilities $ 8,876 $ 1,088\nTOTAL LIABILITIES $ 41,000 $ 19,949\nCommitments and Contingencies — —\nSHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCommon stock -

Nature of Business and Operations\nViemed Healthcare, Inc. (the \"Company\"), through its subsidiaries, is a provider of home medical equipment and post-acute\nrespiratory healthcare services in the United States. The Company’s service offerings are focused on effective in-home treatment\nwith clinical practitioners providing therapy and counseling to patients in their homes using cutting edge technology. The Company\nserves patients in all 50 states of the United States. The Company was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (British\nColumbia) on December 14, 2016. The Company's registered and records office is located at Suite 2800, Park Place, 666 Burrard\nStreet, Vancouver, British Columbia V6C 2Z7 and its corporate office is located at 625 E. Kaliste Saloom Road, Lafayette,\nLouisiana 70508.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company determined that it no longer qualifies as a “smaller reporting company,” but the Company is not\nrequired to comply with the larger company disclosure obligations (subject to certain exemptions and relief from various reporting\nrequirements that are applicable to emerging growth companies) until our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period\nended March 31, 2024. As a result, this Annual Report on Form 10-K is only required to comply with the smaller company\ndisclosure obligations.\nThe Company is an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \"JOBS Act\"), and, as\nsuch, has elected to comply with certain reduced U.S. public company reporting requirements.\nThe Company’s common shares are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \"VMD\".\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and pursuant to the rules and\nregulations of the SEC.\nIn the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments that are necessary to present fairly\nthe financial position, results of operations, and cash flows have been made.\nReporting Currency\nAll values are in U.S. dollars ($ or \"USD\").\nBasis of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany\ntransactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date\nof the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nManagement bases these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience, existing and known circumstances, authoritative\naccounting pronouncements and other factors that management believes to be reasonable. Significant areas requiring the use of\nmanagement estimates relate to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, business combinations, income tax provisions, and fair\nvalue of financial instruments. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company’s chief operating decision-makers (\"CODMs\") are its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, who make\nresource allocation decisions and assess performance based on financial information presented on an aggregate basis. There are\nno segment managers who are held accountable by the chief operating decision-makers, or anyone else, for any planning, strategy\nand key decision-making regarding operations. The corporate office is responsible for contract negotiation with vendors and\npayors, corporate compliance with healthcare laws and regulations, and revenue cycle management, among other corporate\nsupporting functions. Accordingly, the Company has a single reportable segment and operating segment structure based on ASC\n280, Segment Reporting.\nPage F-7\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with an original maturity of three months or less that are\nreadily convertible to known amounts of cash that are subject to insignificant risk or change. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the\nCompany's cash was held primarily in checking and money market accounts. Cash and cash equivalents consist of the following at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nCash $ 7,182 $ 5,910\nMoney market accounts 5,657 11,004\nTotal cash and cash equivalents $ 12,839 $ 16,914\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable and net revenues are based on contractually agreed-upon rates for services provided, reduced by estimated\nadjustments, including variable consideration for implicit price concessions for sales revenue. Inherent in these estimates is the\nrisk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. The complexity of third-party billing\narrangements and laws and regulations governing Medicare and Medicaid may result in adjustments to amounts originally\nrecorded.\nThe Company performs a periodic analysis to review the valuation of accounts receivable and collectability of outstanding\nbalances. These estimates are determined utilizing historical realization data under a portfolio approach which is then assessed by\nmanagement to evaluate whether adjustments should be made based on accounts receivable aging trends, other operating trends,\nand relevant business conditions such as governmental and managed care payor claims processing procedures.\nThe Company records a reserve for estimated probable losses as part of net rental revenue adjustments in order to report rental\nrevenue at an expected collectable amount based on the total portfolio of operating lease receivables for which collectability has\nbeen deemed probable. The accounts receivable are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of the adjustments.\nReceivables are considered past due when not collected by established due dates. Specific patient balances are written off after\ncollection efforts have been followed and the account has been determined to be uncollectible. Revisions in reserve estimates are\nrecorded as an adjustment to net revenue in the period of revision. The estimates of the allowance for uncollectible accounts was\n$11.1 million and $8.5 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIncluded in accounts receivable at December 31, 2023 are amounts due from Medicare and Medicaid representing 28% and 4%,\nrespectively, and 32% combined, of total outstanding net receivables. As of December 31, 2022, 48% of total outstanding\nreceivables were amounts due from Medicare and Medicaid.\nInventory\nInventory represents non-serialized supplies that consist of equipment parts, consumables, and associated product supplies and is\nexpensed at the time of sale or use. The Company values inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Obsolete and\nunserviceable inventories are valued at estimated net realizable value.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at historic cost less accumulated depreciation. Major\nrenewals and improvements that extend the useful life of assets are capitalized to the respective property accounts, while\nmaintenance and repairs, which do not extend the useful life of the respective assets, are expensed as incurred. Management has\nestimated the useful lives of equipment leased to customers. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the\nestimated useful lives of the respective assets. Property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their\nestimated useful lives.\nPage F-8\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe estimated useful lives of the property and equipment are as follows:\nDescription Estimated Useful Lives\nMedical Equipment 1 - 10 Years\nComputer Equipment 5 Years\nOffice Furniture & Fixtures 5 - 10 Years\nLeasehold Improvements Shorter of Useful Life or Lease\nVehicles 5 Years\nBuildings 15 - 39 Years\nLand Indefinite Life\nDepreciation of medical equipment commences at the date of service, which represents the date that the asset has been delivered\nto a patient and is put in use and continues through the useful life of the asset. Property and equipment with definite useful lives are\ntested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nEquity Investments\nEquity investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are comprised of an investment accounted for under the equity method\nand equity investments without readily determinable fair values accounted for under the measurement alternative described in ASC\n321-10-35-2.\nThe following table details the Company’s equity investments:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nEquity method investments $ 320 $ 816\nOther equity investments 1,360 1,339\nBalance, end of period $ 1,680 $ 2,155\nThe Company's equity method investments include a 49% equity interest in Solvet Services, LLC, an entity which provides health\ncare support services to state and federal governments. Investments accounted for under the equity method are investments in\nunconsolidated entities over whose operating and financial policies the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence but\nnot control. Equity method investments are initially measured at cost in the Consolidated Balance Sheets with any subsequent\nadjustments made to the carrying amount of the investment for the Company’s proportionate share of income or loss. Distributions\nreceived from the investee reduce the Company’s carrying value of the investment. The Company has recognized its share of\nincome or loss on the gain (loss) from equity method investments within non-operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome and Comprehensive Income. Equity method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investments may exceed the fair value. No events or changes have occurred\nas of December 31, 2023 that would impair the carrying value of equity method investments.\nOther equity investments include an equity interest in VeruStat, Inc, a remote patient monitoring entity, and an equity interest in\nDMEscripts, LLC, an e-prescribing platform. Other equity investments are investments without a readily determinable fair value\nwhich do not qualify for the practical expedient in ASC 820. For these investments, the Company has elected the measurement\nalternative which measures the investment at cost, less any impairment. ASU 2019-04 clarifies that if an entity identifies observable\nprice changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer, it must measure its equity\ninvestment at fair value in accordance with ASC 820 as of the date that the observable transaction occurred. The Company was\nnot aware of any impairment or observable price change adjustments that needed to be made as of December 31, 2023 on its\ninvestments in equity securities without a readily determinable fair value.\nDebt Investment\nThe Company's debt investment is a variable rate secured convertible note issued by Healthcare DX, Inc. (d/b/a ModoHealth) on\nDecember 21, 2022, classified as an available-for-sale debt instrument. Accrued interest is due upon the 18 month maturity of the\nnote and is included in the amortized cost basis at each reporting period. At each financial statement date until a conversion event,\nthe debt instrument is required to be remeasured at fair value. Changes in unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated\nother comprehensive income, net of tax effect, until realized.\nPage F-9\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets include trade names and other identifiable intangible assets which are amortized on a straight-line basis over a\nperiod of their expected useful lives, generally five years.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $0.5 million in trade names and $0.1 million of other intangibles\nrelated to the acquisition of HMP (as defined below). Amortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets, which is\nincluded in depreciation and amortization in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income,\nwas $75,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The weighted average remaining useful life of intangible assets was 4.4 years\nas of December 31, 2023.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income reflects the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events\nand circumstances from non-owner sources. The Company's comprehensive income represents net income adjusted for unrealized\ngains and losses on derivative instruments, net of tax. Accumulated other comprehensive loss is presented on the accompanying\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as a component of shareholders' equity.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are principally derived from the rental and sale of HME products and services to patients.\nRental revenues\nRevenue generated from equipment that is rented to patients is recognized over the non-cancellable rental period (typically one\nmonth) and commences on delivery of the equipment to the patients. The lease agreements are evaluated at lease\ncommencement and the start of each monthly renewal period to determine if it is reasonably certain that the monthly renewal or\npurchase options would be exercised. The exercise of monthly renewal or purchase options by a patient has historically not been\nreasonably certain to occur at lease commencement or subsequent monthly renewal.\nRevenues are recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with third-party payors, including\nprivate insurers, prepaid health plans, Medicare, Medicaid and patients. Rental revenue, less estimated adjustments, is recognized\nas earned on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable lease term. Rental of patient equipment is billed on a monthly basis\nbeginning on the date the equipment is delivered. Since deliveries can occur on any day during a month, the amount of billings that\napply to the next month are deferred.\nThe Company's lease agreements generally contain lease components and non-lease components which primarily relate to\nsupplies. The Company has made the accounting policy election to account for a lease component of an agreement and its\nassociated non-lease components as a single lease component based on the Company's assessment of classification of the lease\nbased on the consideration in the contract for the combined component.\nSales and Services revenues\nRevenue related to sales of equipment and supplies is recognized on the date of delivery as this is when control of the promised\ngoods is transferred to patients and is presented net of applicable sales taxes. Revenues are recorded only to the extent it is\nprobable that a significant reversal will not occur in the future as amounts may include implicit price concessions under\nreimbursement arrangements with third-party payors, including private insurers, prepaid health plans, Medicare, Medicaid and\npatients. The sales transaction price is determined based on contractually agreed-upon rates, adjusted for estimates of variable\nconsideration. The expected value method is used in determining the variable consideration as part of determining the sales\ntransaction price using historical reimbursement experience, historical sales returns, and other operating trends. Payment terms\nand conditions vary by contract. The timing of revenue recognition, billing, and cash collection generally results in billed and\nunbilled accounts receivable.\nRevenues associated with external staffing services are accrued on an hourly basis and are recorded based on the determination\nof whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent. In arrangements in which the Company manages customers'\nsupplemental workforce needs utilizing its own network of healthcare professionals, the Company is determined to be a principal\nand includes the contractual gross billings in revenues with a corresponding increase to cost of revenues for worksite employee\npayroll costs associated with these services. Alternatively, when the Company acts as agent in the performance of workforce\nmanagement, revenue is recorded based on contractually agreed upon fees or commissions with no associated cost of revenues.\nPage F-10\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe revenues from each major source are summarized in the following table:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nRevenue from rentals\nVentilator rentals, non-invasive and invasive $ 108,258 $ 92,710\nOther durable medical equipment rentals 38,315 21,446\nRevenue from sales and services\nEquipment and supply sales 25,770 13,927\nCOVID-19 response sales and services — 2,278\nService revenues 10,665 8,471\nTotal revenues $ 183,008 $ 138,832\nRevenues from Medicare and Medicaid as percentages of the Company's traditional revenue streams, excluding COVID-19\nresponse sales and services, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nMedicare revenues 44 % 47 %\nMedicaid revenues 2 % 9 %\nTotal Medicare and Medicaid revenues 46 % 56 %\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, \"Compensation—Stock Compensation\",\nwhich establishes accounting for share-based awards exchanged for employee services and requires companies to expense the\nestimated fair value of these awards over the requisite employee service period. Stock–based compensation costs for stock\noptions are determined at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Stock-based compensation costs for RSUs\nare determined at the grant date based on the closing stock price. The expense of such stock-based compensation awards is\nrecognized using the graded vesting attribution method over the vesting period and the offsetting credit is recorded as an increase\nin additional paid-in capital. Forfeitures are recorded as incurred. Any excess tax benefit or deficiency is recognized as a\ncomponent of income taxes and within operating cash flows upon vesting of the share-based award.\nFor the Company’s phantom share units settled in cash, the Company computes the fair value of the phantom share units using the\nclosing price of the Company's stock at the end of each period and records a liability based on the percentage of requisite service.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nThe Company utilized an interest rate swap contract to reduce exposure to fluctuations in variable interest rates for future interest\npayments on the 2019 Term Note (as defined below).\nFor determining the fair value of the interest rate swap contract, the Company uses significant other observable market data or\nassumptions (Level 2 inputs) that market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities, including assumptions about\ncounterparty risk. These fair value estimates reflect an income approach based on the terms of the interest rate swap contract and\ninputs corroborated by observable market data including interest rate curves. The Company presents a positive ending period fair\nvalue of the interest rate swap contract in other long-term assets, as a component of long-term assets, and a negative ending\nperiod fair value of the interest rate swap contract in accrued liabilities, as a component of long-term liabilities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets.\nThe Company recognized any differences between the variable interest rate payments and the fixed interest rate settlements from\nits swap counterparty as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swap. If determined to be an effective cash flow\nhedge, the Company will record the changes in the estimated fair value of the swaps to accumulated other comprehensive income\nor loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. To the extent that interest rate swaps are determined to be ineffective, the Company\nwould recognize the changes in the estimated fair value of swaps in interest and other non-operating expenses, net in its\nConsolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company settled its interest rate swap in connection with the refinancing of its\ncredit facilities and recognized the realized gain of $0.2 million in Other Income.\nPage F-11\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in numerous U.S. jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the\nprovision for income taxes. The Company’s income tax provisions reflect management’s interpretation of country and state tax\nlaws. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course\nof business and may remain uncertain for several years after their occurrence. The Company recognizes assets and liabilities for\ntaxation when it is probable that the Company will receive refunds from or pay taxes to the relevant tax authority. Where the final\ndetermination of tax assets and liabilities is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the\ncurrent and deferred income taxes provision in the period in which such a determination is made. Changes in tax law or changes in\nthe way tax law is interpreted may also impact the Company’s effective tax rate as well as the Company's business and operations.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future income tax consequences attributable to temporary\ndifferences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases. Deferred\nincome tax assets or liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in\nwhich those temporary differences are expected to be settled. The calculation of current and deferred income taxes requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions and to exercise a certain amount of judgment concerning the carrying value of\nassets and liabilities. The current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are also impacted by expectations about future\noperating results and the timing of reversal of temporary differences as well as possible audits of tax filings by regulatory agencies.\nChanges or differences in these estimates or assumptions may result in changes to the current and deferred tax assets and\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and a charge to or recovery of income tax expense.\nDeferred tax is recognized on any temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated\nfinancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable earnings. The effect of a change in the\nenacted tax rates is recognized in net earnings and comprehensive income or in equity depending on the item to which the\nadjustment relates. At each reporting period end, deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability based on whether it is more\nlikely than not that sufficient taxable earnings will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business acquisitions. The results of operations of the business\nacquired by the Company are included as of the respective acquisition date. The acquisition-date fair value of the consideration\ntransferred, including the fair value of any contingent consideration, is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. To the extent the acquisition-date fair value of the\nconsideration transferred exceeds the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed,\nsuch excess is allocated to goodwill. Patient relationships, medical records and patient lists are not reported as separate intangible\nassets due to the regulatory requirements and lack of contractual agreements but are part of goodwill. Customer related\nrelationships are not reported as separate intangible assets but are part of goodwill as authorizing physicians are under no\nobligation to refer the Company’s services to their patients, who are free to change physicians and service providers at any time.\nThe Company may adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, as it obtains more information regarding asset\nvaluations and liabilities assumed that existed but were not available at the acquisition date, which is generally up to one year after\nthe acquisition closing date. Acquisition related costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed\nas incurred.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill resulting from business combinations is not amortized, rather, it is assessed for impairment annually and upon the\noccurrence of a triggering event or change in circumstances indicating a possible impairment. Such triggering events potentially\nwarranting an annual or interim goodwill impairment assessment include, among other factors, declines in historical or projected\nrevenue, operating income or cash flows, and sustained decreases in the Company’s stock price or market capitalization. Such\nchanges in circumstance can include, among others, changes in the legal environment, reimbursement environment, operating\nperformance, and/or future prospects.\nThe Company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year. The impairment\nassessment can be performed on either a quantitative or qualitative basis. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to\ndetermine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. If determined necessary, the Company\napplies the quantitative impairment test to identify and measure the amount of impairment, if any. Fair value determinations require\nconsiderable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors, such as estimates of a reporting unit's\nfair value and judgment about impairment triggering events. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and\nassumptions made for purposes of the annual or interim goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future.\nPage F-12\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company performed an assessment of qualitative factors and determined that no\nevents or circumstances existed that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived\nassets were less than the carrying amount. As such, a quantitative analysis was not required to be performed and the Company did\nnot record any goodwill impairment charges.\nThe Company follows ASC Topic 360, which requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the asset group’s carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In performing the review for\nrecoverability, if future undiscounted cash flows (excluding interest charges) from the use and ultimate disposition of the assets are\nless than their carrying values, an impairment loss represented by the difference between its fair value and carrying value, is\nrecognized. When properties are classified as held for sale they are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or the expected\nsales price less costs to sell. There were no impairment charges recognized during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nNet Income per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nBasic net income per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding\nduring the period. Diluted net income per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of\ncommon stock plus the effect of dilutive stock-based awards outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.\nDilutive stock-based awards include outstanding common stock options and time-based RSUs.\nSee Note 11 for earnings per share computations.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nOn January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on\nFinancial Instruments. The standard replaces the current incurred loss impairment model that recognizes losses when a probable\nthreshold is met with a requirement to recognize lifetime expected credit losses immediately when a financial asset is originated or\npurchased. Further, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04 and ASU 2019-05 to provide additional guidance on the credit losses standard.\nWhile the adoption of ASC 326 could result in a higher allowance recorded in the future for credit losses on receivables within the\nscope of the standard due to the prescribed measurement principles, the impact of the adoption on the Company's consolidated\nfinancials statements was not material.\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, Liabilities — Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of\nSupplier Finance Program Obligations, which requires entities that use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase\nof goods and services to disclose the key terms of the programs and information about their obligations that are outstanding at the\nend of the reporting period. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022,\nincluding interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company adopted this standard during the year ended December 31, 2023, which\ndid not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company” as defined by the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth\ncompany can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can selectively\ndelay the adoption of all accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company\nhas elected to utilize this exemption and, as a result, the consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to the financial\nstatements of issuers that are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are\napplicable to public companies. To date, however, the Company has not delayed the adoption of any accounting standards except\nas noted below. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that the Company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period at\nany time, which election is irrevocable.\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-09,\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which is intended to improve the transparency of income tax\ndisclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the effective tax rate reconciliation and\nincome taxes paid by jurisdiction. The ASU is effective for public business entities' annual periods beginning after December 15,\n2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nPage F-13\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\n3. Business Combinations\nOn June 1, 2023, Viemed, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the acquisition of Home Medical Products,\nInc. (“HMP”), which operates in Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi. The Company acquired 100% of the equity ownership of\nHMP in exchange for approximately $29 million in cash or cash payable, subject to customary post-closing net working capital and\nother adjustments. Approximately $16 million of the purchase consideration was funded by cash on hand, $8 million was funded by\na borrowing on the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, and $5 million was funded by a borrowing on the 2022 Term Loan Facility.\nThe results of HMP’s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. The\nCompany expensed $538,000 of acquisition and integration costs in conjunction with the acquisition for the year ended December\n31, 2023. These costs include system conversion and integrating operations charges, as well as legal and consulting expenses,\nand are included in selling, general, and administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and\nComprehensive Income.\nThe following table summarizes the consideration paid and estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at\nthe acquisition date.\nPurchase Price\nCash paid $ 29,417\nIdentifiable Assets\nCash and cash equivalents 829\nAccounts receivable 2,014\nInventory 582\nPrepaid expenses and other assets 498\nProperty and equipment 4,358\nLease assets 743\nIdentifiable intangibles 641\nOther long-term assets 25\nTOTAL ASSETS 9,690\nIdentifiable Liabilities\nTrade payables 1,985\nDeferred revenue 732\nAccrued liabilities 1,195\nCurrent portion of lease liabilities 536\nCurrent debt 4,558\nLong-term lease liabilities 196\nLong-term debt 836\nTOTAL LIABILITIES 10,038\nNet assets (liabilities) acquired (348)\nResulting goodwill $ 29,765\nPage F-14\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe fair value of accounts receivables acquired is $2.0 million, with the gross contractual amount being $2.9 million. The Company\nexpects $0.9 million to be uncollectible. The amounts of revenue and pre-tax income of HMP included in the Company's\nConsolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income from the acquisition date to December 31, 2023 was $16.2 million\nand $1.3 million, respectively. After the Company's June 30, 2023 financial statements were issued, management identified and\nrecorded immaterial measurement period adjustments to the provisional balances pertaining to the acquired cash and cash\nequivalents, prepaid expenses and other assets, trade payables, and long-term lease liability accounts. As a result of these\nadjustments, there was an increase in the provisional goodwill balance, which resulted in no impact on the current period's income\nor expenses. Also after the Company's June 30, 2023 financial statements were issued, the Company received a final valuation\nreport from a third-party valuation firm. After considering the results of that valuation report, the Company has estimated that the\nfair value of the identified intangible assets acquired as part of the business combination to be $641,000. As a result, the fair value\nof the identifiable intangibles were decreased by $47,000 on December 31, 2023, due to this new information, with a corresponding\nincrease to goodwill. In addition, the change to the provisional amount resulted in a decrease in amortization expense and\naccumulated amortization of $5,500.\nGoodwill resulted from a combination of synergies and cost savings, and further expansion into Tennessee, Alabama, and\nMississippi. All of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes. There are no contingent consideration arrangements included\nin the transaction.\n4. Property and Equipment\nThe Company’s fixed assets consist of its medical equipment held for rental, furniture and equipment, real property and related\nimprovements, and vehicles and other various small equipment.\nThe following table details the Company’s fixed assets:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nMedical equipment $ 110,920 $ 93,893\nFurniture and equipment 3,540 2,792\nLand 2,566 2,566\nBuildings 7,953 7,043\nLeasehold improvements 345 296\nVehicles 1,192 1,052\nLess: Accumulated depreciation (52,937) (39,899)\nProperty and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization $ 73,579 $ 67,743\nDepreciation in the amount of $20.5 million and $14.6 million is included in cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively. Medical equipment purchases with a cost of $1.4 million and $0.7 million were included in accounts\npayable at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n5.

Debt and Lease Liabilities\n2018 Senior Credit Facility\nOn February 20, 2018, the Company entered a Commercial Business Loan Agreement (the \"2018 Senior Credit Facility\") that\nprovided for Term Loans and Lines of Credit with Hancock Whitney Bank. Until November 29, 2022, the Company maintained a\nline of credit in the amount of $30.0 million under the 2018 Senior Credit Facility. On May 30, 2019, the Company entered into a\nterm note (“Building Term Note”) under the 2018 Senior Credit Facility in the principal amount of $4.8 million. The proceeds of the\nBuilding Term Note were used to purchase the Company's corporate headquarters. In connection with the Building Term Note, the\nCompany entered into an interest rate swap transaction (\"Interest Rate Swap Transaction\") with Hancock Whitney Bank effectively\nfixing the interest rate for the Building Term Note at 4.68%. On September 19, 2019, the Company entered into an additional loan\nagreement providing for a term note (the “2019 Term Note\") under the 2018 Senior Credit Facility in the principal amount of $5.0\nmillion and bearing an annual interest rate of 4.60%. The proceeds of the 2019 Term Note were utilized for general corporate\npurposes. The 2019 Term Note matured on September 19, 2022 at which time the entire unpaid balance of principal and interest\nwas repaid in full. In connection with the entry in to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities on November 29, 2022, the Company retired\nthe 2018 Senior Credit Facility, and repaid all outstanding interest and principal in full.\n2022 Senior Credit Facilities\nOn November 29, 2022, the Company refinanced its existing borrowings under the 2018 Senior Credit Facility and entered into a\nnew credit agreement (the \"2022 Senior Credit Facilities\") with the lenders from time to time party thereto, and Regions Bank, as\nadministrative agent (the \"Administrative Agent\") and collateral agent, that provides for an up to $30.0 million revolving credit facility\n(the \"2022 Revolving Credit Facility\") and an up to $30.0 million delayed draw term loan facility (the \"2022 Term Loan Facility\"),\nboth maturing in November 2027.\nThe proceeds of the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility may be used to refinance existing indebtedness, for working capital purposes,\ncapital expenditures and other general corporate purposes (including permitted acquisitions), and to pay transaction fees, costs\nand expenses related to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities. The proceeds of the 2022 Term Loan Facility and any additional term\nloans established in accordance with the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities may be used to finance permitted acquisitions and to pay\ntransaction fees, costs and expenses related to such acquisitions.\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are Term SOFR (as defined in the 2022 Senior Credit\nFacilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 2.625% to 3.375%, or, at the option of the Company, a Base Rate (as\ndefined in the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 1.625% to 2.375%.\nThe 2022 Senior Credit Facilities require the Company to comply with certain affirmative, as well as certain negative covenants\nthat, among other things, will restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur indebtedness, grant liens,\nmake investments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations and pay dividends and other restricted payments. The 2022\nSenior Credit Facilities also include certain financial covenants, which generally include, but are not limited to the following:\n• Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (defined generally as total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than (i) for\nany fiscal quarter ending during the period from the closing date to and including December 31, 2024, 2.75 to 1.0 and (ii)\nfor any fiscal quarter ending on and after March 31, 2025, 2.50 to 1.0, subject to certain adjustments following a material\nacquisition.\n• Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (defined generally as (a) adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditures minus\ncash taxes to (b) the sum of scheduled principal payments plus cash interest expense plus restricted payments) of not\nless than 1.25:1.0.\nThe Company was in compliance with all covenants under the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities in effect at December 31, 2023.\nThe 2022 Senior Credit Facilities include provisions permitting the Company from time to time to, subject to certain terms and\nconditions, increase the aggregate amount of commitments under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility and/or establish one or more\nadditional term loans under the 2022 Term Loan Facility, in each case, with additional commitments from existing lenders or new\ncommitments from financial institutions acceptable to the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion; provided, that, (a) the\naggregate principal amount of any increases in the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, and (b) the aggregate principal amount of all\nadditional term loans under the 2022 Term Loan Facility established after the closing date will not exceed $30.0 million.\nPage F-16\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nFinancing costs related to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are capitalized and amortized over the term of the loans using the\neffective interest method. Upon the initial draw of debt under the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities during the year ended December 31,\n2023, the Company reclassified the deferred financing fees previously recorded in other long-term assets to long-term debt in the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nThe recorded balances associated with the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nOutstanding balance $ 6,875 $ —\nFinancing costs and commitment fees (594)\nLess:\nCurrent portion of notes payable (313) —\nNet long-term notes payable $ 5,968 $ —\nMedical Equipment Financing\nAs a result of the acquisition of HMP, the Company assumed equipment financing obligations consisting of installment payments\nfor medical equipment which secure the financing. The financing obligations are payable in monthly installments through 2026 and\ninclude interest at rates ranging from 0% to 7.99%. As of December 31, 2023, $0.8 million of the outstanding medical equipment\nfinancing obligations is presented on the consolidated balance sheets as short term debt based on the scheduled repayment\ndates.\nLeases\nThe Company has recognized finance lease liabilities for vehicles and operating leases for land and buildings that have terms\ngreater than twelve months, as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nLease liabilities $ 3,250 $ 694\nLess:\nCurrent portion of lease liabilities (934) (495)\nNet long-term lease liabilities $ 2,316 $ 199\nOperating Lease Liabilities\nThe Company has recognized operating lease liabilities that relate primarily to the lease of land and buildings. The exercise of\nlease renewal options is at the Company's sole discretion and is included in the lease term for calculations of its right-of-use assets\nand liabilities when it is reasonably certain that the Company plans to renew these leases. These lease liabilities are recorded at\npresent value based on a discount rate of 5.50%, which was based on the Company's incremental borrowing rate at the time of\nassessment. At December 31, 2023, the weighted average lease term was approximately 4.51 years.\nFuture maturities of the Company's operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023 are summarized as follows:\nLease Liability\n2024 $ 874\n2025 736\n2026 615\n2027 617\n2028 560\nThereafter 7\nTotal lease payments $ 3,409\nLess: imputed interest $ 547\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 2,862\nOperating rental expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 amounted to $999,000 and $539,000, respectively.\nPage F-17\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\n7. Fair Value Measurement\nUnder ASC Topic 820, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (i.e., an exit price). ASC Topic 820 establishes a\nhierarchy for inputs to valuation techniques used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and\nminimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. There are three\nlevels to the hierarchy based on the reliability of inputs, as follows:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or\nsimilar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value\nis greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3.\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe Company measures certain assets at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no transfers between fair value measurement\nlevels during any presented period.\nThe following tables summarize the Company's assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022:\nAt December 31, 2023\n(In thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements:\nMoney market mutual funds $ 5,657 $ — $ — $ 5,657\nAvailable for sale debt instrument — — 2,219 2,219\nTotal $ 5,657 $ — $ 2,219 $ 7,876\nAt December 31, 2022\n(In thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements:\nMoney market mutual funds $ 11,005 $ — $ — $ 11,005\nAvailable for sale debt instrument — — 2,000 2,000\nTotal $ 11,005 $ — $ 2,000 $ 13,005\nAvailable for Sale Debt Instrument\nThe fair value of the Company’s available for sale debt instrument approximates its amortized cost basis due to the short maturity\nand indexed interest rate terms. The fair value is classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the Company evaluates\nadjustments using a combination of observable and unobservable inputs, such as operating results of the counterparty as well\nobservable prices in transactions of debt and equity instruments of the issuing counterparty when available. As of December 31,\n2023, the analysis resulted in no adjustments to the carrying value impacting unrealized gains or losses. All changes to measured\nfair value during the period were the result of accrued interest.\nPage F-18\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nThe Company measures certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets include equity method investments,\nother equity investments, and the fair value allocation related to the Company’s acquisitions.\nEquity method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\nvalue of the investments may exceed the fair value. The Company's other equity investments are holdings in privately-held\ncompanies without a readily determinable market value. The Company remeasures equity securities without readily determinable\nfair value at fair value when an orderly transaction is identified for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer in\naccordance with the measurement alternative under Topic 820. ASU 2019-04 states that the measurement alternative is a\nnonrecurring fair value measurement. Accordingly, other equity investments without readily determinable fair value are classified\nwithin Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because the Company estimates the value using a combination of observable and\nunobservable inputs, including valuation ascribed to the issuing company in subsequent financing rounds, volatility in the results of\noperations of the issuers and rights and obligations of the holdings the Company owns. The Company had no material adjustments\nof equity method investments or other equity investments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during any of the periods\npresented.\nThe fair value allocation related to the Company’s acquisitions are determined using a discounted cash flow approach, or a\nreplacement cost approach, which are based on significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). These valuation methods required\nmanagement to make various assumptions, including, but not limited to, future profitability, cash flows, replacement costs, and\ndiscount rates. The Company’s estimates are based upon historical trends, management’s knowledge and experience and overall\neconomic factors, including projections of future earnings potential. Developing discounted future cash flows in applying the income\napproach requires the Company to evaluate its intermediate to longer-term strategies, including, but not limited to, estimates of\nrevenue growth, operating margins, capital requirements, inflation and working capital management. The development of\nappropriate rates to discount the estimated future cash flows requires the selection of risk premiums, which can materially impact\nthe present value of future cash flows.\nThe Company estimated the fair value of acquired identifiable intangible assets using discounted cash flow techniques that\nincluded an estimate of future cash flows, consistent with overall cash flow projections used to determine the purchase price paid to\nacquire the business, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows. The Company estimated the fair\nvalue of certain acquired identifiable intangible assets based on the cost approach using estimated costs consistent with historical\nexperience. The Company believes the estimates and assumptions used in the valuation methods are reasonable.\nThere were no transfers between fair value measurement levels during any presented period.\n8. Shareholders' Equity\nAuthorized Share Capital\nThe Company’s authorized share capital consists of an unlimited number of common shares, with no stated par value.\nIssued and Outstanding Share Capital\nThe Company has only one class of stock outstanding, common shares. The authorized stock consists of an unlimited number of\ncommon shares with no stated par value, of which 38,506,161 and 38,049,739 shares were issued and outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company acquired and cancelled 75,235 common shares at a cost of $0.6 million to satisfy employee income tax withholding\nassociated with RSUs vesting during the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company’s retained earnings were reduced by the\namount paid for the shares repurchased and cancelled.\nPage F-19\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nStock-Based Compensation\nOn June 11, 2020 (the \"Effective Date\"), the Company’s shareholders approved the Company's 2020 Long Term Incentive Plan\n(the \"Omnibus Plan\") to provide an incentive to attract, retain and reward directors, officers, employees, and consultants who\nprovide services to the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Upon approval of the Omnibus Plan, no future awards are available to\nbe made under the Company's previous RSU and Option Plans (collectively, the \"Former Plan\"), and the common shares that were\nnot settled or awarded under the Former Plan as of the Effective Date are available for awards under the Omnibus Plan. The\nmaximum number of common shares that are available for awards under the Omnibus Plan and under any other security based\ncompensation arrangements adopted by the Company, including the Former Plan, may not exceed 7,758,211 shares (equal to 20%\nof the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company on the Effective Date). The maximum amount of the foregoing\ncommon shares that may be awarded under the Omnibus Plan as “incentive stock options” is 2,600,000 common shares. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding options of 4,214,000 and RSUs of 1,226,000 associated with common shares\nunder the Omnibus Plan.\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in\nthousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nStock-based compensation - options $ 1,165 $ 3,094\nStock-based compensation - restricted stock units 4,684 2,108\nTotal $ 5,849 $ 5,202\nAt December 31, 2023, there was approximately $335,000 of total unrecognized pre-tax stock option expense under the\nCompany's equity compensation plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.07 years. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, there was approximately $3,892,000 of total unrecognized pre-tax compensation expense related to\noutstanding time-based restricted stock units that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.86 years.\nOptions\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nNumber of Weighted average\noptions Weighted average remaining Aggregate\n(000's) exercise price(1) contractual life intrinsic value(2)\nBalance December 31, 2021 3,822 $ 5.22 7.4 years $ 3,722\nIssued 764 5.29\nExercised (83) 3.55\nExpired / Forfeited (6) 5.21\nBalance December 31, 2022 4,497 $ 5.26 6.9 years $ 11,356\nIssued — —\nExercised (246) 5.42\nExpired / Forfeited (37) 6.33\nBalance December 31, 2023 4,214 $ 5.25 5.9 years $ 11,698\n(1)For presentation purposes, stock options issued with a Canadian dollar exercise price have been translated to U.S. dollars based on the\nprevailing exchange rate on the date of grant.\n(2)The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding represents the difference between the exercise price of the option and the closing price of the\nCompany's common shares on the last trading day of the period ($7.85 and $7.56 on December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively).\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding was $11,698,000 and options exercisable were $10,432,000 at December 31,\n2023. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, 246,022 and 82,822 common shares were issued pursuant to\nthe exercise of stock options, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had 3,461,000 exercisable stock options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price\nof $4.99 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.5 years. At December 31, 2022, the Company had 2,841,000\nexercisable stock options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $4.53 and a weighted average remaining\ncontractual life of 6.1 years.\nPage F-20\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe fair value of the stock options has been charged to the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income and\ncredited to additional paid-in capital over the vesting period, using the grant date fair value based on the Black-Scholes option\npricing model. The assumptions used to determine the grant date fair value of stock options include exercise price, risk-free interest\nrates, expected volatility, and average life of an option. The risk-free interest rates are based on the rates available at the time of\nthe grant for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the option’s expected life. The average life of an\noption is based on both historical and projected exercise and lapsing data. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from\ntraded options on the Company's common shares and historical volatility of the Company's common shares over the expected life\nof the option. There were no issuances of options during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe Company accounts for RSUs using fair value. The fair value of the RSUs has been charged to the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome and Comprehensive Income and credited to additional paid-in capital over the vesting period, based on the stock price on\nthe date of grant. RSUs vest generally over a one or three-year period. The Company accounts for forfeitures of RSUs under ASU\n2016-09 and recognizes forfeitures in the period in which they occur.\nThe following table summarizes RSU activity for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nWeighted\nWeighted average Aggregate\nNumber of average grant remaining intrinsic\nRSUs (000's) price contractual life value(1)\nBalance December 31, 2021 206 $ 6.61 0.68 years $ 1,074\nIssued 581 5.44\nVested (149) 6.27\nExpired / Forfeited (9) 6.45\nBalance December 31, 2022 629 $ 5.62 0.88 years $ 4,755\nIssued 921 7.88\nVested (286) 5.82\nExpired / Forfeited (38) 6.98\nBalance December 31, 2023 1,226 $ 7.23 0.86 years $ 9,624\n(1)The aggregate intrinsic value of time-based RSUs outstanding was based on the closing price of the Company's common shares on the last\ntrading day of the period ($7.85 and $7.56 on December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company issued 920,588 RSUs, with a vesting term of one or three years and a\nfair value between $7.10 and $7.93 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued 580,962 RSUs,\nwith a vesting term of one to three years and a fair value between $5.21 and $6.34 per share.\nPage F-21\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nPhantom Share Units\nThe Company has a phantom share unit plan, which it uses for grants to directors, officers, and employees. Phantom share units\ngranted under the plan are non-assignable and are settled in cash at vesting based on the fair value of the Company's common\nstock on the vesting date. Phantom share units vest annually over a three-year period. The cash-settled phantom share units are\naccounted for as liability awards and are re-measured at fair value each reporting period until they become vested with accrued\nliability and related expense being recognized over the requisite service period.\nThe following table summarizes phantom share unit activity for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nNumber of phantom Value of share\nshare units (000's) equivalents(1)\nBalance December 31, 2021 573 $ 2,991\nIssued 256 1,320\nVested (263) (1,383)\nExpired / Forfeited (53) (401)\nBalance December 31, 2022 513 3,878\nIssued 181 1,444\nVested (245) (2,354)\nExpired / Forfeited (31) (241)\nBalance December 31, 2023 418 3,281\n(1)The value of outstanding share equivalents at the beginning of the period is based on the market price of the Company’s common shares at that\ntime; the value of issued share equivalents is based on the market price of the Company’s common shares at issuance; the value of vested share\nequivalents is based on the cash paid at the time of vesting; and the values of expired/forfeited share equivalents and outstanding share\nequivalents at the end of the period are based on the market price of the Company's common shares at the end of the period. The market price of\nthe Company's common shares was $7.85 and $7.56 on December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nThe change in fair value of the phantom share units has been charged to the Consolidated Statements of Income and\nComprehensive Income and recorded as a liability included in accrued liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities. The total liability\nassociated with phantom share units at December 31, 2023 is $2,425,000, with $1,867,000 of this amount included in current\naccrued liabilities and the remaining portion of $558,000 included in long-term accrued liabilities. At December 31, 2022, the total\nliability associated with phantom share units was $2,593,000, with $1,704,000 of this amount included in current accrued liabilities\nand the remaining portion of $889,000 included in long-term accrued liabilities.\nThe impact associated with the fair value re-measurement of phantom share units is recorded in selling, general and administrative\nexpenses within the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. The following table summarizes expense\nassociated with the phantom share units for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nSelling, general and administrative $ 2,189 $ 2,316\nThe Company paid cash settlements of $2.4 million and $1.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, pertaining to vestings of cash-settled phantom share units.\n9. Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company accrues estimates for resolution of any legal and other contingencies when losses are probable and reasonably\nestimable in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies (“ASC 450”). No less than quarterly, the Company reviews the status of\neach significant matter underlying a legal proceeding or claim and assess our potential financial exposure. The Company accrues a\nliability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any legal proceeding or claim is considered probable and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether\nthe amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable, and accruals are based only on the information available to the Company at\nthe time the judgment is made, which may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate or unanticipated events and circumstances may\noccur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, the outcome of legal proceedings is\ninherently uncertain, and we may incur substantial defense costs and expenses defending any of these matters.\nPage F-22\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nLegal Proceedings\nAs previously disclosed, the Company (through its subsidiary Sleep Management LLC) submitted a purchase order (the “Purchase\nOrder”) in March 2020 to Vyaire Medical, Inc. d/b/a CareFusion Respiratory Technologies (“Vyaire”) for respiratory equipment. The\nCompany ultimately prepaid $1.4 million towards the delivery of such respiratory equipment. Vyaire was unable or unwilling to\ndeliver the vast majority of the respiratory equipment referenced in the Purchase Order, and also refused to refund the prepayment\namount (less the amounts paid for equipment actually received). On July 29, 2020, the Company (through its subsidiary Sleep\nManagement LLC) filed a lawsuit against Vyaire in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana (the\n“Court”). This lawsuit was dismissed on December 8, 2020 in connection with the commencement of the lawsuit filed by the\nCompany (through its subsidiary Sleep Management) on November 5, 2020, against Vyaire in the 15th Judicial District Court for\nthe Parish of Lafayette, Louisiana (the “State Court”) seeking damages for breach of contract and seeking a declaratory judgment\nthat the Company is not required to pay any further funds to Vyaire. On December 28, 2020, Vyaire filed its Answer, Affirmative\nDefenses, and Reconventional Demand (“Reconventional Demand”) with the State Court alleging breach of contract and seeking\ndamages of $4.7 million purportedly for the improper cancellation of the Purchase Order. The Company filed its Answer to the\nReconventional Demand on February 12, 2021 and the parties completed discovery on July 17, 2023. The State Court issued an\norder on September 5, 2023 granting the Company Partial Summary Judgment finding that Vyaire breached the contract. The\nremaining issue of the damages suffered by the Company as a result of the breach will be determined at a non-jury trial pending\nresolution of Vyaire’s interlocutory appeal of the State Court’s partial summary judgment ruling.\nThe Company continues to believe that it has valid legal and equitable grounds to recover its outstanding prepayment as a result of\nVyaire’s failure to deliver the vast majority of the respiratory equipment referenced in the Purchase Order. The Company has\ndetermined that a loss related to the Reconventional Demand is not probable, and thus has not accrued a liability related to this\nclaim. Although a loss may be reasonably possible, the Company does not have sufficient information to determine the amount or\nrange of reasonably possible loss with respect to the Reconventional Demand given that the dispute is in the early stages of the\nlegal process. At December 31, 2023, outstanding funds in the amount of $0.9 million related to undelivered respiratory equipment\nare included within other long-term assets.\nGovernmental and Regulatory Matters\nFrom time to time the Company is involved in various external governmental investigations, audits and reviews. Reviews, audits\nand investigations of this sort can lead to government actions, which can result in the assessment of recoupment of\nreimbursement, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way the Company\nconducts business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs.\nIn May of 2021, a final report and recommendation (“Report”) was issued by the OIG regarding an audit by OIG of claims relating to\n100 of the Company’s non-invasive ventilation at home (“NIVH”) patients. The OIG asserted that most of the sampled Medicare\nclaims submitted for the monthly rental of non-invasive ventilators did not comply with Medicare requirements. The Company firmly\nbelieved that the Report ignored each patient’s diagnosis and supporting documentation of that diagnosis from treating and\nprescribing physicians and applied clinical guidelines that were contrary to CMS’s accepted standard of care. In late June of 2021,\nthe Company received initial request letters from DME Medicare Administrative Contractors (\"MACs\") referencing the Report and\nrequesting repayment of purported overpayments. The Company responded to each initial request by submitting a rebuttal and by\nfiling a redetermination appeal as prescribed by the initial request letters and by statute. In September 2021, the MACs informed\nthe Company of unfavorable decisions with respect to the redetermination appeals. In November 2021, the Company filed\nReconsideration Appeals with CMS's designated Qualified Independent Contractor (\"QIC\"). Based on its review, the QIC\ndetermined that approximately 77% of the claims it reviewed were medically necessary and properly payable under Medicare rules\nand regulations, overturning OIG’s and the MACs' initial recommendations and determinations. As a result of the QIC's\nreconsideration findings, reduced and recalculated principal overpayment requests totaling $1.1 million were issued by the MACs.\nIn order to limit the assessment of interest during the appeals period, the Company remitted the associated funds to the MACs. In\nDecember 2022, an Administrative Law Judge overturned all of the remaining appealed claims and instructed the MACs to refund\nall funds previously remitted by the Company. Accordingly, the funds remitted to the MACs were recorded in Prepaid expenses and\nother assets at December 31, 2022 and were received during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n10. Income Taxes\nIncome taxes are computed in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, which requires, among other things, a balance\nsheet approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected\nfuture tax consequences of events that have been recognized in its consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this\nmethod, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying\namounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in the years in which the differences are expected to\nreverse.\nPage F-23\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe Company is required to make certain estimates and judgments about the application of tax law, the expected resolution of\nuncertain tax positions and other matters. In the event that uncertain tax positions are resolved for amounts different than the\nCompany’s estimates, or the related statutes of limitations expire without the assessment of additional income taxes, the Company\nwill be required to adjust the amounts of related assets and liabilities in the period in which such events occur. Such adjustment\nmay have a material impact on the Company’s income tax provision and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no amounts recorded for uncertain tax positions and does not expect any\nmaterial changes in uncertain tax benefits during the next 12 months. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to\nincome tax matters in income tax expense. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in various\nstates. The Company is generally not subject to examination by taxing authorities for years prior to 2020.\nThe provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income\nbefore the provision for income taxes. The sources and tax effects of the differences are as follows:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nNet income before income taxes $ 14,391 $ 8,990\nStatutory income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 %\nComputed provision for income taxes 3,022 1,888\nState income tax expense 549 278\nPermanent differences 520 435\nPrior Year True Ups 64 150\nChanges in valuation allowance for deferred tax assets (7) 17\nProvision for income taxes $ 4,148 $ 2,768\nThe significant components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nCurrent taxes:\nFederal $ 4,242 $ 614\nState 1,345 408\nTotal current taxes 5,587 1,022\nDeferred taxes:\nFederal $ (991) $ 1,660\nState (448) 86\nTotal deferred taxes (1,439) 1,746\nProvision for income taxes $ 4,148 $ 2,768\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis\nof assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. In assessing the\nrealizability of deferred income tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that all, or some portion, of the\ndeferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the\ngeneration of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management\nconsiders the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment.\nManagement evaluates the need for valuation allowances on the deferred income tax assets according to the provisions of FASB\nASC 740, Income Taxes. In making this determination, management assesses all available evidence, both positive and negative,\navailable at the balance sheet date. This includes, but is not limited to, recent earnings, internally prepared income projections, and\nhistorical financial performance.\nPage F-24\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nState fixed asset and net operating losses $ 1,043 $ 833\nGoodwill 7,977 9,384\nAllowance for doubtful accounts 2,874 2,200\nAccrued compensation and other 1,782 1,071\nAccrued phantom stock 628 672\nStock-based compensation 4,098 3,401\nCapitalized costs 1,137 628\nLease liability 842 180\nOther 170 —\nUNICAP 15 13\nTotal deferred tax assets $ 20,566 $ 18,382\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nRight-of-use asset $ (848) $ (180)\nProperty and equipment (15,141) (15,057)\nTotal deferred liabilities $ (15,989) $ (15,237)\nValuation allowance:\nNet deferred tax asset before valuation allowance $ 4,577 $ 3,145\nLess: valuation allowance (19) (26)\nNet deferred tax asset $ 4,558 $ 3,119\nPage F-25\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\n11. Earnings Per Share\nIncome per common share is calculated using earnings for the year divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding\nduring the year. Using the treasury stock method, diluted income per share amounts are calculated giving effect to the potential\ndilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to issue common shares were exercised or converted to common shares by\nassuming the proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs are used to purchase common shares\nat the prevailing market rate.\nThe following reflects the earnings and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNumerator - basic and diluted:\nNet income attributable to shareholders $ 10,243 $ 6,222\nDenominator:\nBasic weighted average number of common shares 38,354,071 38,655,403\nDiluted weighted average number of shares 40,378,922 39,807,434\nBasic earnings per share $ 0.27 $ 0.16\nDiluted earnings per share $ 0.25 $ 0.16\nDenominator calculation from basic to diluted:\nBasic weighted average number of common shares 38,354,071 38,655,403\nStock options and other dilutive securities 2,024,851 1,152,031\nDiluted weighted average number of shares 40,378,922 39,807,434\nAnti-dilutive shares excluded from the calculation consisted of dilutive employee stock options and RSUs that were de minimis in all\nperiods presented.\nPage F-26\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nItem 9.

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in\nRules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the\nperiod covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure\nthat information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated\nand communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosure.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that the Company's disclosures controls and procedures will detect or\nuncover all failures of persons within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries to disclose material information otherwise\nrequired to be set forth in the Company's periodic reports. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of\ndisclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and\nprocedures.\nManagement Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for\nthe Company. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, as a\nprocess designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by\nthe Board, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes\npolicies and procedures that:\n• Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the Company;\n• Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\n• Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of\nthe Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of\nany evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes\nin conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment,\nmanagement used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include, and we were not required to include, an attestation report of our independent\nregistered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for as long as we remain an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business\nStartups Act.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31,\n2023 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial\nreporting.\nPage 43\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nItem 9B.

This description also summarizes relevant provisions of the Business\nCorporations Act (British Columbia) (the “Business Corporations Act”) and certain other United States and\nCanadian laws. The following description is a summary and does not purport to be complete. It is subject\nto, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the applicable provisions of the Business Corporations Act\nand the other United States and Canadian laws referred to below, and our Notice of Articles pursuant to\nthe Business Corporations Act (the “Notice of Articles”), and our Amended and Restated Business\nCorporations Act Articles (the “Articles”), which are filed as Exhibit 3.1 and Exhibit 3.2, respectively, to the\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.1 is a part, and are incorporated by reference herein.\nWe encourage you to read the Notice of Articles and the Articles, and the applicable provisions of the\nBusiness Corporations Act and the other United States and Canadian laws referred to below for additional\ninformation. Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company”\nin this Exhibit 4.1 refer solely to Viemed Healthcare, Inc. and not to our subsidiaries.\nShare Capital\nAuthorized Share Capital\nWe are organized under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada. The core charter\ndocuments for British Columbia companies are the Articles and the Notice of Articles. Pursuant to the\nNotice of Articles and the Articles, our authorized capital consists of an unlimited number of common\nshares, no par value.\nIssued Share Capital\nAs of February 9, 2024, there were 38,756,636 common shares issued and outstanding.\nDescription of Common Shares\nAll of the common shares are of the same class and, once issued, rank equally as to dividends,\nvoting powers and participation in assets and in all other respects, on liquidation, dissolution or winding\nup of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, or any other distribution of the assets of the\nCompany among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs after the Company has paid out\nits liabilities. The issued common shares will not be subject to call or assessment by the Company nor are\nthere any pre-emptive, conversion, exchange, sinking fund, redemption or retraction rights attaching to\nthe common shares.\nAll registered holders of the common shares are entitled to receive notice of any general or\nspecial meeting to be convened by the Company. At any general or special meeting, subject to the\nrestrictions on joint registered owners of the common shares, each holder of the common shares is\nentitled to one vote per share for each common share of which it is the registered owner and may\nexercise such votes either in person or by proxy. Otherwise, on a show of hands every shareholder who is\npresent in person and entitled to vote will have one vote, and on a poll every shareholder will have one\nvote for each common share of which it is the registered owner.\nIssue of Shares\nOur Board of Directors (the “Board”) may, subject to the Business Corporations Act, applicable\nsecurities laws and the Articles, issue, allot, sell or otherwise dispose of the unissued shares, and issued\nshares held by the Company, at the times, to the persons, including directors, in the manner, on the terms\n1\nand conditions and for the issue prices that the Board, in its absolute discretion, subject to the Business\nCorporations Act, may determine.\nRepurchase by the Company of its Shares\nSubject to applicable securities laws, including compliance with the “issuer bid” rules, and the\nspecial rights or restrictions attached to any class or series of shares and any applicable criteria set forth\nin the Business Corporations Act, the Company may, if authorized to do so by the Board, purchase or\notherwise acquire any of its shares.\nMeetings of Shareholders: Procedures, Admission and Voting Rights\nGeneral meetings of shareholders may be held at any place within or outside British Columbia,\nCanada as determined by the Board and designated in the notice of meeting or waiver of notice thereof.\nThe Company must hold an annual general meeting at least once in each calendar year and not more\nthan 15 months after the last annual general meeting.\nNotice of a meeting of shareholders must be sent to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at\na meeting of shareholders not less than 21 days prior to the date of the meeting or such other minimum\nday period as required by the applicable securities laws. This notice period applies to all general and\nextraordinary meetings, including a meeting in which a special resolution, exception or special separate\nresolution may be passed.\nIf a meeting of shareholders is to consider special business as specified in the Articles, the notice\nof meeting must state the general nature of the special business and, if the special business includes\nconsidering, approving, ratifying, adopting or authorizing any document or the signing of or giving of effect\nto any document, (i) have attached to it a copy of the document, or (ii) state that a copy of the document\nwill be made available for inspection by the shareholders in the manner specified in the Articles.\nExtraordinary general meetings of shareholders may be held as frequently as they are called by\nthe Board. In addition, under the Business Corporations Act shareholders holding in the aggregate at\nleast 1/20 of our outstanding shares may requisition the Board to call a general meeting of shareholders\nto deal with matters that may be dealt with at a general meeting, including election of directors. If the\nBoard does not call the meeting within the timeframes specified in the Business Corporations Act, a\nsubset of the requisitioning shareholders holding in the aggregate at least 1/40 of our outstanding shares\ncan call the meeting and we must reimburse the costs unless the shareholders resolve otherwise by\nordinary resolution.\nThe only persons entitled to be present at a meeting of the shareholders shall be those entitled to\nvote at that meeting, the directors, our president (if any), our secretary and assistant secretary (if any),\nour lawyers and auditors and others who, although not entitled to vote, are entitled or required under the\nBusiness Corporations Act or the Articles to be present at the meeting. Every shareholder entitled to vote\nmay appoint a proxyholder to attend the meeting in the manner and to the extent authorized and with the\nauthority conferred by the proxy. Any other person may be admitted only on the invitation of directors or\nthe chair of the meeting. All meetings of shareholders shall be presided over by the chair of the Board or,\nif the chair of the Board is absent or unwilling to preside, the president of the Company, or if there is no\npresident or the president is absent or unwilling to preside, such other persons determined as set out in\nthe Articles.\nAdvance Notice Provisions\n2\nThe Articles provide for advance notice of nominations of directors which require that advance\nnotice be provided to the Company in circumstances where nominations of persons for election to the\nBoard are made by shareholders of the Company other than pursuant to: (i) a requisition of a meeting of\nshareholders made pursuant to the provisions of the Business Corporations Act; or (ii) a shareholder\nproposal made pursuant to the provisions of the Business Corporations Act.\nMajority Voting Policy\nAs of May 23, 2018, the Board adopted a majority voting policy that requires, in an “uncontested”\nelection of directors, that shareholders be able to vote for, or withhold from voting, separately for each\ndirector nominee. If, with respect to any particular nominee, the number of votes withheld from voting by\nshareholders exceeds the number of votes for the nominee by shareholders, then although the director\nnominee will have been successfully elected to the Board pursuant to applicable corporate laws, he or\nshe will then be required to offer to tender his or her resignation to the Chair of the Corporate Governance\nand Nominating Committee (the “CG&N Committee”) promptly following the meeting of shareholders at\nwhich the director was so elected. The CG&N Committee will consider such offer and make a\nrecommendation to the Board on whether to accept it or not. The Board will promptly accept the\nresignation unless it determines, in consultation with the CG&N Committee, that there are exceptional\ncircumstances that should delay the acceptance of the resignation or justify rejecting it. The Board will\nmake its decision and announce it in a press release within 90 days following the applicable meeting of\nshareholders. A director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to the majority voting policy will not\nparticipate in any meeting of the Board or the CG&N Committee at which the resignation is considered.\nCertain Takeover Bid Requirements\nUnless such offer constitutes an exempt transaction, an offer made by a person (an “offeror”) to\nacquire outstanding shares of a Canadian entity that, when aggregated with the offeror’s holdings (and\nthose of persons or companies acting jointly with the offeror), would constitute 20% or more of the\noutstanding shares, would be subject to the take-over provisions of Canadian securities laws. The\nforegoing is a limited and general summary of certain aspects of applicable securities law in the provinces\nand territories of Canada, all in effect as of the date hereof.\nIn addition to those take-over bid requirements noted above, the acquisition of shares may trigger\nthe application of additional statutory regimes including amongst others, the Investment Canada Act\n(Canada) and the Competition Act (Canada).\nThis summary is not a comprehensive description of relevant or applicable considerations\nregarding such requirements and, accordingly, is not intended to be, and should not be interpreted as,\nlegal advice to any prospective purchaser and no representation with respect to such requirements to any\nprospective purchaser is made. Prospective investors should consult their own Canadian legal advisors\nwith respect to any questions regarding securities law in the provinces and territories of Canada.\nActions Requiring a Special Majority\nUnder the Business Corporations Act, unless otherwise stated in the Articles, certain corporate\nactions require the approval of a special majority of shareholders, meaning holders of shares representing\n66 2/3% of those votes cast in respect of a shareholder vote addressing such matter. Those items\nrequiring the approval of a special majority generally relate to fundamental changes with respect to our\nbusiness, and include amongst others, resolutions: (i) removing a director prior to the expiry of his or her\nterm; (ii) altering certain sections of the Articles, (iii) approving an amalgamation; (iv) approving a plan of\narrangement; and (v) providing for a sale of all or substantially all of our assets.\nListing; Transfer Agent and Registrar\n3\nOur common shares trade in the United States on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the trading\nsymbol “VMD.”\nComputershare Trust Company is the transfer agent and registrar for our common shares.\nOther Canadian Laws Affecting U.S. Shareholders\nThere are no governmental laws, decrees or regulations in Canada relating to restrictions on the\nexport or import of capital, or affecting the remittance of interest, dividends or other payments by us to\nnon-residents of Canada.\nThere are no limitations specific to the rights of non-residents of Canada to hold or vote our\ncommon shares under the federal laws of Canada, the Business Corporations Act, or in our Articles or\nNotice of Articles, other than those imposed by the Investment Canada Act (Canada) as discussed below.\nNon-Canadian investors who acquire a controlling interest in us may be subject to the Investment\nCanada Act (Canada), which governs the basis on which non-Canadians may invest in Canadian\nbusinesses. Under the Investment Canada Act (Canada), the acquisition of a majority of the voting\ninterests of an entity (or of a majority of the undivided ownership interests in the voting common shares of\nan entity that is a corporation) is deemed to be an acquisition of control of that entity. The acquisition of\nless than a majority but one-third or more of the voting common shares of a corporation (or of an\nequivalent undivided ownership interest in the voting common shares of the corporation) is presumed to\nbe acquisition of control of that corporation unless it can be established that, on the acquisition, the\ncorporation is not controlled in fact by the acquirer through the ownership of the voting common shares.\nThe acquisition of less than one-third of the voting common shares of a corporation (or of an equivalent\nundivided ownership interest in the voting common shares of the corporation) is deemed not to be\nacquisition of control of that corporation.\nTax Matters Applicable to Ownership of Our Common Shares\nHolders Resident in the United States\nThe following portion of this summary is applicable to a holder of our common shares who, for the\npurposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the “Tax Act”) and the Canada-United States Tax Convention\n(1980), as amended (the “Treaty”), at all relevant times, is not resident or deemed to be resident in\nCanada, is a resident of the United States for the purposes of the Treaty and qualifies for the full benefits\nthereunder, and who does not use or hold (and is not deemed to use or hold) the Company’s common\nshares in connection with a business carried on in Canada (a “U.S. Resident Holder”). This part of the\nsummary is not applicable to a U.S. Resident Holder that is an insurer that carries on an insurance\nbusiness in Canada.\nTaxation of Dividends\nDividends paid or credited or deemed to be paid or credited by the Company to a non-resident of\nCanada will generally be subject to Canadian withholding tax at the rate of 25%, subject to any applicable\nreduction in the rate of such withholding under an income tax treaty between Canada and the country\nwhere the holder is resident. Under the Treaty, the withholding tax rate in respect of a dividend paid to a\nU.S. Resident Holder that beneficially owns such dividends is generally reduced to 15%, unless the U.S.\nResident Holder is a C Corporation shareholder which owns at least 10% of the voting shares of the\nCompany at that time, in which case the withholding tax rate is reduced to 5%.\nDisposition of Common Shares\n4\nA U.S. Resident Holder will not be subject to tax under the Tax Act in respect of any capital gain\nrealized on the disposition of our common shares, provided that the common shares are not “taxable\nCanadian property” for purposes of the Tax Act. Provided that the common shares are listed on a\ndesignated stock exchange at a particular time, the common shares generally will not constitute taxable\nCanadian property to a U.S. Resident Holder at that time unless, at any time during the 60 month period\nimmediately preceding that time: (i) 25% or more of the issued shares of any class or series of the\nCompany’s capital stock were owned by any combination of (a) the U.S. Resident Holder, (b) persons\nwith whom the U.S. Resident Holder did not deal at arm’s length, and (c) partnerships in which the U.S.\nResident Holder or a person described in (b) holds a membership interest directly or indirectly through\none or more partnerships; and (ii) more than 50% of the value of the common shares was derived, directly\nor indirectly, from one or any combination of (a) real or immoveable property situated in Canada, (b)\nCanadian resource properties, (c) timber resource properties, and (d) options in respect of, or an interest\nin, any such property (whether or not the property exists), all for purposes of the Tax Act. A U.S. Resident\nHolder’s common shares can also be deemed to be taxable Canadian property in certain circumstances\nset out in the Tax Act.\n5\nEXHIBIT 21.1\nList of Subsidiaries\nName Jurisdiction of Formation\nViemed, Inc.

OVERVIEW\nIn accordance with the applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market (the “Nasdaq Rules”), Section 10D and Rule\n10D-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) (“Rule 10D-1”), the Board of\nDirectors (the “Board”) of Viemed Healthcare, Inc. (the “Company”) has adopted this Policy (the “Policy”) to provide\nfor the recovery of erroneously awarded Incentive-based Compensation from Executive Officers. All capitalized terms\nused and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in Section H, below.\n2. RECOVERY OF ERRONEOUSLY AWARDED COMPENSATION\n(a) In the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Company will reasonably promptly recover the Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation Received in accordance with the Nasdaq Rules and Rule 10D-1 as follows:\ni. After an Accounting Restatement, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the\nCompany (if composed entirely of independent directors, or in the absence of such a committee, a\nmajority of independent directors serving on the Board) (the “Committee”) shall determine the\namount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received by each Executive Officer and shall\npromptly notify each Executive Officer with a written notice containing the amount of any\nErroneously Awarded Compensation and a demand for recovery of such compensation.\n1. For Incentive-based Compensation based on (or derived from) the Company’s stock price or\ntotal shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not\nsubject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the applicable\nAccounting Restatement:\na. The amount to be recovered shall be determined by the Committee based on a reasonable\nestimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the Company’s stock price or\ntotal shareholder return upon which the Incentive-based Compensation was Received;\nand\nb. The Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of such reasonable\nestimate and provide the relevant documentation as required to Nasdaq.\nii. The Committee shall have discretion to determine the appropriate means of recovering Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation based on the particular facts and circumstances, which may include,\nwithout limitation: (i) requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive-based Compensation previously\npaid; (ii) seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or\nother disposition of any equity-based awards; (iii) offsetting the recouped amount from any\ncompensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Executive Officer; (iv) cancelling\noutstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or (v) taking any other remedial and recovery\naction permitted by law, as determined by the Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as\nset forth in Section B(2) below, in no event may the Company accept an amount that is less than the\namount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation in satisfaction of an Executive Officer’s\nobligations hereunder.\niii. To the extent that the Executive Officer has already reimbursed the Company for any Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation Received under any duplicative recovery obligations established by the\nCompany or applicable law, it shall be appropriate for any such reimbursed amount to be credited\nto the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation that is subject to recovery under this Policy.\niv. To the extent that an Executive Officer fails to permit the Company to recover all Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation when due, the Company shall take all actions reasonable and appropriate\nto recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation from the applicable Executive Officer. The\napplicable Executive Officer shall be required to reimburse the Company for any and all expenses\nreasonably incurred (including legal fees) by the Company in recovering such Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.\n(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to take the actions\ncontemplated by Section B(1) above if the Committee (which, as specified above, is composed entirely of\nindependent directors or in the absence of such a committee, a majority of the independent directors serving\non the Board) determines that recovery would be impracticable and any of the following two conditions are\nmet:\ni. The Committee has determined that the direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing\nthe Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before making this determination, the\nCompany must make a reasonable attempt to recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation,\ndocument such attempt(s) and provide such documentation to Nasdaq; or\nii. Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are\nbroadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of Section\n401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and regulations\nthereunder.\n3. DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS\nThe Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy required by applicable U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”) filings and rules.\n4. PROHIBITION OF INDEMNIFICATION\nThe Company shall not be permitted to insure or indemnify any Executive Officer against (i) the loss of any\nErroneously Awarded Compensation that is recovered pursuant to the terms of this Policy, or (ii) any claims relating to\nthe Company’s enforcement of its rights under this Policy. Further, the Company shall not enter into any agreement\nthat exempts any Incentive-based Compensation that is granted, paid or awarded to an Executive Officer from the\napplication of this Policy or that waives the Company’s right to recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation,\nand this Policy shall supersede any such agreement (whether entered into before, on or after the effective date of this\nPolicy).\n5. ADMINISTRATION AND INTERPRETATION\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Committee, and any determinations made by the Committee shall be final and\nbinding on all affected individuals.\nThe Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary,\nappropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy and for the Company’s compliance with the Nasdaq\nRules, Section 10D, Rule 10D-1 and any other applicable law, regulation, rule or interpretation of the SEC or Nasdaq,\npromulgated or issued in connection therewith.\n6. AMENDMENT; TERMINATION\nThe Committee may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems\nnecessary. Notwithstanding anything in this Section F to the contrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy shall\nbe effective if such amendment or termination would (after taking into account any actions taken by the Company\ncontemporaneously with such amendment or termination) cause the Company to violate any federal securities laws,\nSEC rule or Nasdaq Rule.\n7. OTHER RECOVERY RIGHTS\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Executive Officers and, to the extent required by applicable law\nor guidance from the SEC or Nasdaq, their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.\nThe Committee intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent required by applicable law. Any\nemployment agreement, equity award agreement, compensatory plan or any other agreement or arrangement with an\nExecutive Officer shall be deemed to include, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, an agreement by the\nExecutive Officer to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of recovery under this Policy is in addition to, and not\nin lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recovery that may be available to the Company under applicable law,\nregulation or rule or pursuant to the terms of any policy of the Company or any provision in any employment\nagreement, equity award agreement, compensatory plan, agreement or other arrangement.\n8.

The\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022 was derived from audited consolidated financial statements but\ndoes not include all disclosures required by GAAP. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in\nconjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the report of the Company's independent\nregistered public accounting firm included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe nature of the Company's business is such that the results of any interim period may not be indicative of the results to be\nexpected for the entire year.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany\ntransactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date\nof the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiod. Management bases these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience, existing and known circumstances,\nauthoritative accounting pronouncements and other factors that management believes to be reasonable. Significant areas requiring\nthe use of management estimates relate to revenue recognition, accounts receivable and the related allowance for doubtful\naccounts, income tax provisions, and fair value of financial instruments. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nPage 8\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company’s chief operating decision-makers (\"CODMs\") are its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, who make\nresource allocation decisions and assess performance based on financial information presented on an aggregate basis. There are\nno segment managers who are held accountable by the chief operating decision-makers, or anyone else, for any planning, strategy\nand key decision-making regarding operations. The corporate office is responsible for contract negotiation with vendors and\npayors, corporate compliance with healthcare laws and regulations, and revenue cycle management, among other corporate\nsupporting functions. Accordingly, the Company has a single reportable segment and operating segment structure based on ASC\n280, Segment Reporting.\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts receivable are regularly reviewed for collectability and an allowance is recorded to cover the estimated bad debts and\nbilling modifications. The accounts receivable are presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets net of the allowance\nfor doubtful accounts. It is possible that the estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts could change, which could have a\nmaterial impact on our operations and cash flows.\nThe Company writes off receivables when the likelihood for collection is remote, and when the Company believes collection efforts\nhave been fully exhausted and it does not intend to devote additional resources in attempting to collect. The write-offs are charged\nagainst the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company's evaluation takes into consideration such factors as historical bad\ndebt and billing modification experience, national and local economic trends and conditions, industry and regulatory conditions,\nother collection indicators and information about disaggregated receivables. The complexity of many third-party billing\narrangements, patient qualification for medical necessity of equipment and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain\nservices from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded.\nThe estimates and charge-offs for the allowance for doubtful accounts for each reporting period were as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2023 September 30, 2022\nBalance, beginning of year $ 8,483 $ 7,031\nProvision for uncollectible accounts 10,800 7,811\nAmounts charged off (7,722) (6,326)\nBalance, end of period $ 11,561 $ 8,516\nIncluded in accounts receivable at September 30, 2023 are amounts due from Medicare and Medicaid representing 31% and 5%,\nrespectively, and 36% combined, of total outstanding net receivables. As of December 31, 2022, 48% of total outstanding\nreceivables were amounts due from Medicare and Medicaid.\nRevenues from Medicare and Medicaid as percentages of the Company's traditional revenue streams, excluding COVID-19\nresponse sales and services, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nMedicare revenues 46 % 46 % 45 % 47 %\nMedicaid revenues 8 % 8 % 9 % 9 %\nTotal Medicare and Medicaid 54 % 54 % 54 % 56 %\nInventory\nInventory represents non-serialized supplies that consist of equipment parts, consumables, and associated product supplies and is\nexpensed at the time of sale or use. The Company values inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Obsolete and\nunserviceable inventories are valued at estimated net realizable value.\nPage 9\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment is presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at historic cost less accumulated\ndepreciation. Major renewals and improvements that extend the useful life of assets are capitalized to the respective property\naccounts, while maintenance and repairs, which do not extend the useful life of the respective assets, are expensed as incurred.\nManagement has estimated the useful lives of equipment leased to customers. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Property and equipment are amortized on a straight-line basis over\ntheir estimated useful lives.\nDepreciation of medical equipment commences at the date of service, which represents the date that the asset has been delivered\nto a patient and is put in use and continues through the useful life of the asset. Property and equipment with definite useful lives are\ntested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nEquity investments\nEquity investments on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are comprised of an investment accounted for under the\nequity method and equity investments without readily determinable fair values accounted for under the measurement alternative\ndescribed in ASC 321-10-35-2.\nThe following table details the Company’s equity investments:\nSeptember 30, 2023 December 31, 2022\nEquity method investments $ 424 $ 816\nOther equity investments 1,347 1,339\nBalance, end of period $ 1,771 $ 2,155\nThe Company's equity method investments include a 49% equity interest in Solvet Services, LLC, an entity which provides health\ncare support services to state and federal governments. Investments accounted for under the equity method are investments in\nunconsolidated entities over whose operating and financial policies the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence but\nnot control. Equity method investments are initially measured at cost in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with any\nsubsequent adjustments made to the carrying amount of the investment for the Company’s proportionate share of income or loss.\nDistributions received from the investee reduce the Company’s carrying value of the investment. The Company has recognized its\nshare of income or loss on the gain (loss) from equity method investments within non-operating expenses in the Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Income. Equity method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investments may exceed the fair value. No events or changes have occurred\nas of September 30, 2023 that would impair the carrying value of equity method investments.\nOther equity investments include an equity interest in VeruStat, Inc., a remote patient monitoring entity, and an equity interest in\nDMEscripts, LLC, an e-prescribing platform. Other equity investments are investments without a readily determinable fair value\nwhich do not qualify for the practical expedient in ASC 820. For these investments, the Company has elected the measurement\nalternative which measures the investment at cost, less any impairment. ASU 2019-04 clarifies that if an entity identifies observable\nprice changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer, it must measure its equity\ninvestment at fair value in accordance with ASC 820 as of the date that the observable transaction occurred. The Company was\nnot aware of any impairment or observable price change adjustments that needed to be made as of September 30, 2023 on its\ninvestments in equity securities without a readily determinable fair value.\nDebt Investment\nThe Company's debt investment is a variable rate secured convertible note issued by Healthcare DX, Inc. (d/b/a ModoHealth) on\nDecember 21, 2022, classified as an available-for-sale debt instrument. Accrued interest is due upon the 18 month maturity of the\nnote and is included in the amortized cost basis at each reporting period. At each financial statement date until a conversion event,\nthe debt instrument is required to be remeasured at fair value. Changes in unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated\nother comprehensive income, net of tax effect, until realized.\nPage 10\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nValuation of Goodwill\nGoodwill resulting from business combinations is not amortized, rather, it is assessed for impairment annually and upon the\noccurrence of a triggering event or change in circumstances indicating a possible impairment. Such triggering events potentially\nwarranting an annual or interim goodwill impairment assessment include, among other factors, declines in historical or projected\nrevenue, operating income or cash flows, and sustained decreases in the Company’s stock price or market capitalization. Such\nchanges in circumstance can include, among others, changes in the legal environment, reimbursement environment, operating\nperformance, and/or future prospects. The Company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill during the fourth\nquarter of each year. The impairment assessment can be performed on either a quantitative or qualitative basis. The Company first\nassesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. If\ndetermined necessary, the Company applies the quantitative impairment test to identify and measure the amount of impairment, if\nany. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors,\nsuch as estimates of a reporting unit's fair value and judgment about impairment triggering events. As a result, there can be no\nassurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual or interim goodwill impairment test will prove to be\naccurate predictions of the future. During the three months ended September 30, 2023 the Company evaluated the events and\nchanges that could indicate that goodwill might be impaired and concluded that an interim test was not necessary.\nComprehensive income\nComprehensive income reflects the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events\nand circumstances from non-owner sources. The Company's comprehensive income represents net income adjusted for unrealized\ngains and losses on derivative instruments, net of tax. Accumulated other comprehensive loss is presented on the accompanying\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of shareholders' equity.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue from a customer consists of sales and rentals of home medical equipment and patient medical services. Patient revenues\nare billed to and collections received from Medicare, Medicaid, third-party insurers, co-insurance and patient-pay. Patient revenue\nis recognized net of contractual adjustments and bad debt based on contractual arrangements with third-party payors, an\nevaluation of expected collections resulting from the analysis of current and past due accounts, past collection experience in\nrelation to amounts billed and other relevant information. Contractual adjustments result from the differences between the rates\ncharged for services and reimbursement rates paid by government-sponsored healthcare programs and insurance companies for\nsuch services.\nThe Company's contracts with customers often include multiple products and services, and the Company evaluates these\narrangements to determine the unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes based on whether the product or service is\ndistinct from other products or services in the arrangement and should be accounted for as a separate performance obligation. A\nproduct or service is distinct if the customer can benefit from it on its own or together with other readily available resources and the\nCompany's ability to transfer the goods or services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contractual arrangement\nwith the customer (e.g. patient). Revenue is then allocated to each separately identifiable good or service based on the standalone\nprice of the items underlying the performance obligations. Most of the Company’s products fall in the Medicare Fee-for-Service\n(“FFS”) program which is a payment model where services are unbundled and paid for separately. These services are paid based\non a Medicare determined price that is publicly available on the website for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”).\nFor commercial payors, HME companies must negotiate in-network pricing separately, though in general, the Company’s payors\ntend to benchmark their contract rates and coverage policies closely to those of Medicare.\nThe Company considers performance obligations for sales and rentals to be met when the customer receives the equipment, and\nrevenue for rentals is recognized over time, over the respective rental period. For revenue associated with HME rentals, the\nCompany recognizes revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 842, “Leases,” (Topic 842). For any HME sales and services, the\nCompany recognizes revenue under FASB ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” (Topic 606) and related\namendments.\nThe Company recognizes equipment rental revenue over the non-cancelable lease term, which varies based on the type of\nequipment rental, less estimated adjustments, in accordance with Topic 842. The Company has separate contracts with each\npatient that are not subject to a master lease agreement with any third-party payor. The Company would first consider the lease\nclassification issue (sales-type lease or operating lease) and then appropriately recognize or defer rental revenue over the lease\nterm.\nPage 11\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nRevenues associated with external staffing services are accrued on an hourly basis and are recorded based on the determination\nof whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent. In arrangements in which the Company manages customers'\nsupplemental workforce needs utilizing its own network of healthcare professionals, the Company is determined to be a principal\nand includes the contractual gross billings in revenues with a corresponding increase to cost of revenues for worksite employee\npayroll costs associated with these services. Alternatively, when the Company acts as agent in the performance of workforce\nmanagement, revenue is recorded based on contractually agreed upon fees or commissions with no associated cost of revenues.\nThe revenues from each major source are summarized in the following table:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nRevenue from rentals under Topic 842\nVentilator rentals, non-invasive and invasive $ 28,322 $ 23,869 $ 79,181 $ 68,123\nOther durable medical equipment rentals 11,119 5,882 26,441 15,153\nRevenue from sales and services under Topic 606\nEquipment and supply sales 7,742 3,649 19,287 9,931\nCOVID-19 response sales and services — — — 2,278\nService revenues 2,219 2,359 7,360 5,839\nTotal revenues $ 49,402 $ 35,759 $ 132,269 $ 101,324\nRevenue Accounting under Topic 842\nThe Company leases HME such as non-invasive and invasive ventilators, positive airway pressure (\"PAP\") machines, percussion\nvests, oxygen concentrator units and other small respiratory equipment to customers for a fixed monthly amount on a month-to-\nmonth basis. The customer generally has the right to cancel the lease at any time during the rental period. The Company accounts\nfor these rentals as operating leases.\nUnder FASB ASC Topic 842, the Company recognizes rental revenue on operating leases on a straight-line basis over the\ncontractual lease term which varies based on the type of equipment rental. The lease term begins on the date equipment is\ndelivered to patients, and revenues are recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with\nthird-party payors, including Medicare, private commercial payors, and Medicaid. Certain customer co-payments are included in\nrevenue when considered probable of payment, which is generally when paid.\nDue to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which the Company operates, certain estimates are\nrequired to record net revenue and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that\nthey will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. Specifically, the complexity of many third-party\nbilling arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in\nadjustments to amounts originally recorded. Such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application\nor claim denial.\nRevenue Accounting under Topic 606\nThe Company sells HME, replacement parts and supplies to customers and recognizes revenue based on contractual payment\nrates as determined by the payors at the point in time where control of the good or service is transferred through delivery to the\ncustomer. The customer and, if applicable, the payors are generally charged at the time that the product is sold. For sales of\nequipment previously placed in service, proceeds associated with these sales are recorded to gain (loss) on disposal of property\nand equipment.\nPage 12\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nThe Company also provides sleep study services to customers and recognizes revenue when the sleep study results are complete,\nsatisfying the performance obligation. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company began offering contact and vaccine\ntracing services, which revenues are recognized in the period in which the service has been provided. The transaction price on\nequipment sales, sleep studies and contact and vaccine tracing is the amount that the Company expects to receive in exchange for\nthe goods and services provided. Due to the nature of the HME business, gross charges are retail charges and generally do not\nreflect what the Company is ultimately paid. As such, the transaction price is constrained for the difference between the gross\ncharge and what is estimated to be collected from payors and from patients. The transaction price therefore is predominantly based\non contractual payment rates as determined by the payors. The payment terms and conditions of customer contracts vary by\ncustomer type and the products and services offered.\nFor staffing services, performance obligations in the staffing agreements are satisfied over time when the customer simultaneously\nreceives and consumes the benefits provided. Accordingly, revenues from staffing services are recognized on an hourly basis as\nservices are rendered by the job site employee in both principal and agent arrangements.\nThe Company determines its estimates of contractual allowances and discounts based upon contractual agreements, its policies\nand historical experience. While the rates are fixed for the product or service with the customer and the payors, such amounts\ntypically include co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles, which vary in amounts, and are due from the patient. The Company\nincludes in the transaction price only the amount that the Company expects to be entitled, which is substantially all of the payor\nbillings at contractual rates. The transaction price is initially constrained by the amount of customer co-payments, which are\nincluded in the transaction price when considered probable of payment and included in revenue if the product or service has\nalready been provided to the customer.\nDue to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which the Company operates, certain estimates are\nrequired to record net revenue and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that\nthey will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. Specifically, the complexity of many third-party\nbilling arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in\nadjustments to amounts originally recorded. Such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application\nor claim denial.\nReturns and refunds are not accepted on equipment sales, sleep study services, staffing services, or contact and vaccine tracing\nservices. The Company does not offer warranties to customers in excess of the manufacturer’s warranty. Any taxes due upon sale\nof the products or services are not recognized as revenue. The Company does not have any partially or unfilled performance\nobligations related to contracts with customers and as such, the Company has no contract liabilities as of September 30, 2023.\nStock-based compensation\nThe Company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, \"Compensation—Stock Compensation\",\nwhich establishes accounting for share-based awards exchanged for employee services and requires companies to expense the\nestimated fair value of these awards over the requisite employee service period. Stock–based compensation costs for stock\noptions are determined at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Stock-based compensation costs for\nrestricted stock units (\"RSUs\") are determined at the grant date based on the closing stock price. The expense of such stock-based\ncompensation awards is recognized using the graded vesting attribution method over the vesting period and the offsetting credit is\nrecorded as an increase in additional paid-in capital. Forfeitures are recorded as incurred. Any excess tax benefit or deficiency is\nrecognized as a component of income taxes and within operating cash flows upon vesting of the share-based award.\nFor the Company’s phantom share units settled in cash, the Company computes the fair value of the phantom share units using the\nclosing price of the Company's stock at the end of each period and records a liability based on the percentage of requisite service.\nInterest rate swaps\nThe Company utilized an interest rate swap contract to reduce exposure to fluctuations in variable interest rates for future interest\npayments on the 2019 Term Note (as defined below).\nPage 13\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nFor determining the fair value of the interest rate swap contract, the Company uses significant other observable market data or\nassumptions (Level 2 inputs) that market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities, including assumptions about\ncounterparty risk. These fair value estimates reflect an income approach based on the terms of the interest rate swap contract and\ninputs corroborated by observable market data including interest rate curves. The Company presents a positive ending period fair\nvalue of the interest rate swap contract in other long-term assets, as a component of long-term assets, and a negative ending\nperiod fair value of the interest rate swap contract in accrued liabilities, as a component of long-term liabilities on the Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company recognized any differences between the variable interest rate payments and the fixed interest rate settlements from\nits swap counterparty as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swap. If determined to be an effective cash flow\nhedge, the Company will record the changes in the estimated fair value of the swaps to accumulated other comprehensive income\nor loss on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. To the extent that interest rate swaps are determined to be ineffective, the\nCompany would recognize the changes in the estimated fair value of swaps in interest and other non-operating expenses, net in its\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Income.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company settled its interest rate swap in connection with the refinancing of its\ncredit facilities and recognized the realized gain of $0.2 million in Other Income.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in numerous U.S. jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the\nprovision for income taxes. The Company's income tax provisions reflect management’s interpretation of country and state tax\nlaws. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course\nof business and may remain uncertain for several years after their occurrence. The Company recognizes assets and liabilities for\ntaxation when it is probable that the Company will receive refunds from or pay taxes to the relevant tax authority. Where the final\ndetermination of tax assets and liabilities is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the\ncurrent and deferred income taxes provision in the period in which such a determination is made. Changes in tax law or changes in\nthe way tax law is interpreted may also impact the Company's effective tax rate as well as the Company's business and operations.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future income tax consequences attributable to temporary\ndifferences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases. Deferred\nincome tax assets or liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in\nwhich those temporary differences are expected to be settled. The calculation of current and deferred income taxes requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions and to exercise a certain amount of judgment concerning the carrying value of\nassets and liabilities. The current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are also impacted by expectations about future\noperating results and the timing of reversal of temporary differences as well as possible audits of tax filings by regulatory agencies.\nChanges or differences in these estimates or assumptions may result in changes to the current and deferred tax assets and\nliabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and a charge to or recovery of income tax expense.\nPage 14\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nCARES Act Funds Received\nThe Company received a general distribution payment from the Provider Relief Fund of $3.5 million in April 2020, a targeted\ndistribution payment of $1.5 million in November 2021, and a general distribution payment of $0.4 million in January 2022. The\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") has stated that Provider Relief Fund payments are not loans and will not\nneed to be repaid. However, as a condition to the receipt of funds, the Company and any other providers must agree to a detailed\nset of terms and conditions. CMS has indicated that the terms and conditions may be subject to ongoing changes and reporting.\nThere is no US GAAP guidance for for-profit health care entities that receive government grants that are not in the form of an\nincome tax credit, revenue from a contract with a customer or a loan. As such, for-profit entities must determine the appropriate\naccounting treatment by analogy to other guidance such as International Accounting Standards (IAS) 20, Accounting for\nGovernment Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance, in International Financial Reporting Standards. Under IAS 20, the\nCompany determined that upon receipt of funds, it fully complied with the conditions attached to the grant. The Company\nrecognized the distributions received from the Provider Relief Fund in the income statement in full during the period of receipt. To\nthe extent that reporting requirements and terms and conditions are modified, it may affect the Company's ability to comply and\nmay require the return of funds. The Company is not aware of any such modifications as of September 30, 2023\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nOn January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on\nFinancial Instruments. The standard replaces the current incurred loss impairment model that recognizes losses when a probable\nthreshold is met with a requirement to recognize lifetime expected credit losses immediately when a financial asset is originated or\npurchased. Further, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04 and ASU 2019-05 to provide additional guidance on the credit losses standard.\nWhile the adoption of ASC 326 could result in a higher allowance recorded in the future for credit losses on receivables within the\nscope of the standard due to the prescribed measurement principles, the impact of the adoption on the Company's consolidated\nfinancials statements was not material.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company” as defined by the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth\ncompany can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can selectively\ndelay the adoption of all accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company\nhas elected to utilize this exemption and, as a result, the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements may not be\ncomparable to the financial statements of issuers that are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting\nstandards that are applicable to public companies. To date, however, the Company has not delayed the adoption of any accounting\nstandards except as noted below. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that the Company can elect to opt out of the extended\ntransition period at any time, which election is irrevocable.\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, Liabilities — Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of\nSupplier Finance Program Obligations, which requires entities that use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase\nof goods and services to disclose the key terms of the programs and information about their obligations that are outstanding at the\nend of the reporting period. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022,\nincluding interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company does not expect the update to affect the recognition, measurement, or\nfinancial statement presentation of supplier finance program obligations, but is evaluating the impact of the update on related\ndisclosures upon adoption.\nPage 15\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\n3. Business Combinations\nOn June 1, 2023, Viemed, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the acquisition of Home Medical Products,\nInc., (“HMP”), which operates in Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi. The Company acquired 100% of the equity ownership of\nHMP in exchange for approximately $29.4 million in cash or cash payable, subject to customary post-closing net working capital\nand other adjustments. Approximately $15 million of the purchase consideration was funded by cash on hand, $8 million was\nfunded by a borrowing on the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, and $5 million was funded by a borrowing on the 2022 Term Loan\nFacility.\nThe results of HMP’s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. The\nCompany expensed $477,000 of acquisition costs in conjunction with the acquisition for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023.

The Company is in the process of obtaining third-party valuations of certain fixed assets\nand identifiable intangible assets; thus, the provisional measurements of property plant and equipment, trade names, non-compete\nagreements, and goodwill are subject to a material change. After the Company's June 30, 2023 financial statements were issued,\nmanagement identified and recorded immaterial measurement period adjustments to the provisional balances pertaining to the\nacquired cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses other assets, trade payables, and long-term lease liability accounts. As a\nresult of these adjustments, there was a reduction in the provisional goodwill balance, which resulted in no impact on the current\nperiod's income or expenses.\nGoodwill resulted from a combination of synergies and cost savings, and further expansion into Tennessee, Alabama, and\nMississippi.

Debt\n2018 Senior Credit Facility\nOn February 20, 2018, the Company entered a Commercial Business Loan Agreement (the \"2018 Senior Credit Facility\") that\nprovided for Term Loans and Lines of Credit with Hancock Whitney Bank. Until November 29, 2022, the Company maintained a\nline of credit in the amount of $10.0 million under the 2018 Senior Credit Facility. On May 30, 2019, the Company entered into a\nterm note (“Building Term Note”) under the 2018 Senior Credit Facility in the principal amount of $4.8 million. The proceeds of the\nBuilding Term Note were used to purchase the Company's corporate headquarters. In connection with the Building Term Note, the\nCompany entered into an interest rate swap transaction (\"Interest Rate Swap Transaction\") with Hancock Whitney Bank effectively\nfixing the interest rate for the Building Term Note at 4.68%. On September 19, 2019, the Company entered into an additional loan\nagreement providing for a term note (the “2019 Term Note\") under the 2018 Senior Credit Facility in the principal amount of $5.0\nmillion and bearing an annual interest rate of 4.60%. The proceeds of the 2019 Term Note were utilized for general corporate\npurposes. The 2019 Term Note matured on September 19, 2022 at which time the entire unpaid balance of principal and interest\nwas repaid in full. In connection with the entry in to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities on November 29, 2022, the Company retired\nthe 2018 Senior Credit Facility, and repaid all outstanding interest and principal in full.\n2022 Senior Credit Facilities\nOn November 29, 2022, the Company refinanced its existing borrowings under the 2018 Senior Credit Facility and entered into a\nnew credit agreement (the \"2022 Senior Credit Facilities\") with the lenders from time to time party thereto, and Regions Bank, as\nadministrative agent (the \"Administrative Agent\") and collateral agent, that provides for an up to $30.0 million revolving credit facility\n(the \"2022 Revolving Credit Facility\") and an up to $30.0 million delayed draw term loan facility (the \"2022 Term Loan Facility\"),\nboth maturing in November 2027.\nThe proceeds of the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility may be used to refinance existing indebtedness, for working capital purposes,\ncapital expenditures and other general corporate purposes (including permitted acquisitions), and to pay transaction fees, costs\nand expenses related to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities. The proceeds of the 2022 Term Loan Facility and any additional term\nloans established in accordance with the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities may be used to finance permitted acquisitions and to pay\ntransaction fees, costs and expenses related to such acquisitions.\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are Term SOFR (as defined in the 2022 Senior Credit\nFacilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 2.625% to 3.375%, or, at the option of the Company, a Base Rate (as\ndefined in the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 1.625% to 2.375%.\nThe 2022 Senior Credit Facilities require the Company to comply with certain affirmative, as well as certain negative covenants\nthat, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make\ninvestments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations and pay dividends and other restricted payments. The 2022 Senior\nCredit Facilities also include certain financial covenants, which generally include, but are not limited to the following:\n• Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (defined generally as total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than (i) for\nany fiscal quarter ending during the period from the closing date to and including December 31, 2024, 2.75 to 1.0 and (ii)\nfor any fiscal quarter ending on and after March 31, 2025, 2.50 to 1.0, subject to certain adjustments following a material\nacquisition.\n• Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (defined generally as (a) adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditures minus\ncash taxes to (b) the sum of scheduled principal payments plus cash interest expense plus restricted payments) of not\nless than 1.25:1.0.\nThe Company was in compliance with all covenants under the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities in effect at September 30, 2023.\nPage 18\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nThe 2022 Senior Credit Facilities includes provisions permitting the Company from time to time to, subject to certain terms and\nconditions, increase the aggregate amount of commitments under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility and/or establish one or more\nadditional term loans under the 2022 Term Loan Facility, in each case, with additional commitments from existing lenders or new\ncommitments from financial institutions acceptable to the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion; provided, that, (a) the\naggregate principal amount of any increases in the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, and (b) the aggregate principal amount of all\nadditional term loans under the 2022 Term Loan Facility established after the closing date will not exceed $30.0 million.\nFinancing costs related to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are capitalized and amortized over the term of the loans using the\neffective interest method.\nThe recorded balances associated with the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2023 December 31, 2022\nOutstanding balance $ 8,938 $ —\nFinancing costs and commitment fees (715) —\nLess:\nCurrent portion of notes payable (188) —\nNet long-term notes payable $ 8,035 $ —\nMedical Equipment Financing\nAs a result of the acquisition of HMP, the Company assumed equipment financing obligations consisting of installment payments\nfor medical equipment which secure the financing. The financing obligations are payable in monthly installments through 2026 and\ninclude interest at rates ranging from 0% to 7.99%. As of September 30, 2023, $1.6 million of the outstanding medical equipment\nfinancing obligations is presented on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as short term debt and $0.1 million is presented\nas long term debt, based on the scheduled repayment dates.\n7. Fair Value Measurement\nUnder ASC Topic 820, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (i.e., an exit price). ASC Topic 820 establishes a\nhierarchy for inputs to valuation techniques used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and\nminimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. There are three\nlevels to the hierarchy based on the reliability of inputs, as follows:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or\nsimilar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value\nis greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3.\nPage 19\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe Company measures certain assets at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no transfers between fair value measurement\nlevels during any presented period.\nThe following tables summarize the Company's assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022:\nAt September 30, 2023\n(In thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements:\nMoney market mutual funds $ 5,615 $ — $ — $ 5,615\nAvailable for sale debt instrument — — 2,164 2,164\nTotal $ 5,615 $ — $ 2,164 $ 7,779\nAt December 31, 2022\n(In thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements:\nMoney market mutual funds $ 11,005 $ — $ — $ 11,005\nAvailable for sale debt instrument $ — $ — $ 2,000 $ 2,000\nTotal $ 11,005 $ — $ 2,000 $ 13,005\nAvailable for Sale Debt Instrument\nThe fair value of the Company’s available for sale debt instrument approximates its amortized cost basis due to the short maturity\nand indexed interest rate terms. The fair value is classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the Company evaluates\nadjustments using a combination of observable and unobservable inputs, such as operating results of the counterparty as well\nobservable prices in transactions of debt and equity instruments of the issuing counterparty when available. As of September 30,\n2023, the analysis resulted in no adjustments to the carrying value impacting unrealized gains or losses. All changes to measured\nfair value during the period were the result of accrued interest.\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nThe Company measures certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets include equity method investments and\nother equity investments. Equity method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying value of the investments may exceed the fair value. The Company's other equity investments are holdings\nin privately-held companies without a readily determinable market value. The Company remeasures equity securities without\nreadily determinable fair value at fair value when an orderly transaction is identified for an identical or similar investment of the\nsame issuer in accordance with the measurement alternative under Topic 820. ASU 2019-04 states that the measurement\nalternative is a nonrecurring fair value measurement. Accordingly, other equity investments without readily determinable fair value\nare classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because the Company estimates the value using a combination of\nobservable and unobservable inputs, including valuation ascribed to the issuing company in subsequent financing rounds, volatility\nin the results of operations of the issuers and rights and obligations of the holdings the Company owns.\nThe Company had no material adjustments of assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during any of the periods\npresented. There were no transfers between fair value measurement levels during any presented period.\nPage 20\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\n8. Shareholders' Equity\nAuthorized share capital\nThe Company’s authorized share capital consists of an unlimited number of common shares, with no stated par value.\nIssued and outstanding share capital\nThe Company has only one class of stock outstanding, common shares. The authorized stock consists of an unlimited number of\ncommon shares with no stated par value, of which 38,489,001 and 38,049,739 shares were issued and outstanding as of\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company acquired and cancelled 75,235 common shares at a cost of\n$0.6 million to satisfy employee income tax withholding associated with RSUs vesting. The Company’s retained earnings were\nreduced by the amount paid for the shares repurchased and cancelled.\nStock-based compensation\nEffective June 11, 2020 (the \"Effective Date\"), the Company’s shareholders approved the Company's 2020 Long Term Incentive\nPlan (the \"Omnibus Plan\"). Upon approval of the Omnibus Plan, no future awards are available to be made under the Company's\nprevious RSU and Option Plans (collectively, the \"Former Plan\"), and the common shares that were not settled or awarded under\nthe Former Plan as of the Effective Date are available for awards under the Omnibus Plan. The maximum number of common\nshares that are available for awards under the Omnibus Plan and under any other security-based compensation arrangements\nadopted by the Company, including the Former Plan, may not exceed 7,758,211 shares (equal to 20% of the issued and\noutstanding common shares of the Company on the Effective Date). The maximum amount of the foregoing common shares that\nmay be awarded under the Omnibus Plan as “incentive stock options” is 2,600,000 common shares. As of September 30, 2023, the\nCompany had outstanding options of 4,236,000 and RSUs of 1,230,000 associated with common shares under the Omnibus Plan.\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and\n2022 (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nStock-based compensation - options $ 263 $ 767 $ 911 $ 2,344\nStock-based compensation - restricted stock units 1,190 542 3,404 1,541\nTotal $ 1,453 $ 1,309 $ 4,315 $ 3,885\nAt September 30, 2023, there was approximately $597,000 of total unrecognized pre-tax stock option expense under the\nCompany's equity compensation plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.15 years. As of\nSeptember 30, 2023, there was approximately $5,200,000 of total unrecognized pre-tax compensation expense related to\noutstanding time-based restricted stock units that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.10 years.\nPage 21\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nOptions\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2023:\nNumber of Weighted average\noptions Weighted average remaining Aggregate\n(000's) exercise price(1) contractual life intrinsic value(2)\nBalance December 31, 2022 4,497 $ 5.26 6.9 years $ 11,356\nIssued — —\nExercised (229) 5.51\nExpired / Forfeited (32) 6.51\nBalance September 30, 2023 4,236 $ 5.24 6.1 years $ 7,975\n(1)For presentation purposes, stock options issued with a Canadian dollar exercise price have been translated to U.S. dollars based on the\nprevailing exchange rate on the date of grant.\n(2)The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding represents the difference between the exercise price of the option and the closing share price\nof the Company's common stock on the last trading day of the period ($6.73).\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding was $7,974,846 and options exercisable were $7,247,301 at September 30,\n2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, 229,000 common shares were issued pursuant to the exercise of stock\noptions.\nAt September 30, 2023, the Company had 3,451,000 exercisable stock options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price\nof $4.97 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.7 years. At December 31, 2022, the Company had 2,841,000\nexercisable stock options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $4.53 and a weighted average remaining\ncontractual life of 6.1 years.\nThe fair value of the stock options has been charged to the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income and\ncredited to additional paid-in capital over the vesting period, using the grant date fair value based on the Black-Scholes option\npricing model. The assumptions used to determine the grant date fair value of stock options include exercise price, risk-free interest\nrates, expected volatility, and average life of an option. The risk-free interest rates are based on the rates available at the time of\nthe grant for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the option’s expected life. The average life of an\noption is based on both historical and projected exercise and lapsing data. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from\ntraded options on the Company's common shares and historical volatility of the Company's common shares over the expected life\nof the option. There were no issuances of options during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nRestricted stock units\nThe Company accounts for RSUs using fair value. The fair value of the RSUs has been charged to the Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Income and Comprehensive Income and credited to additional paid-in capital over the vesting period, based on the\nstock price on the date of grant. RSUs vest generally over a one or three-year period. The Company accounts for forfeitures on\nRSUs under ASU 2016-09 and recognizes forfeitures in the period in which they occur.\nThe following table summarizes RSU activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2023:\nWeighted\nWeighted average Aggregate\nNumber of average grant remaining intrinsic\nRSUs (000's) price contractual life value(1)\nBalance December 31, 2022 629 $ 5.62 0.88 years $ 4,755\nIssued 916 7.88\nVested (286) 5.82\nExpired / Forfeited (29) 6.92\nBalance September 30, 2023 1,230 $ 7.23 1.10 years $ 8,274\n(1)The aggregate intrinsic value of time-based RSUs outstanding was based on the Company's closing stock price on the last trading day of the\nperiod ($6.73).\nPage 22\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company issued 213,369 RSUs with a vesting term of one year and a fair\nvalue of $1.7 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company issued 916,000 RSUs with a vesting term\nof one or three years and a fair value of $7.3 million.\nPhantom share units\nThe Company has a phantom share unit plan, which it uses for grants to directors, officers, and employees. Phantom share units\ngranted under the plan are non-assignable and are settled in cash at vesting based on the fair value of the Company's common\nstock on the vesting date. Phantom share units vest annually over a three-year period. The cash-settled phantom share units are\naccounted for as liability awards and are re-measured at fair value each reporting period until they become vested with accrued\nliability and related expense being recognized over the requisite service period.\nThe following table summarizes phantom share unit activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2023:\nNumber of phantom Value of share\nshare units (000's) equivalents(1)\nBalance December 31, 2022 513 $ 3,878\nIssued 181 1,444\nVested (245) (2,354)\nExpired / Forfeited (26) (175)\nBalance September 30, 2023 423 $ 2,847\n(1)The value of outstanding share equivalents at the beginning of the period is based on the market price of the Company’s stock at that time, the\nvalue of issued share equivalents is based on the market price of the Company’s stock at issuance, the value of vested share equivalents is based\non the cash paid at the time of vesting, and the values of expired/forfeited share equivalents and outstanding share equivalents at the end of the\nperiod are based on the market price of the Company's stock at the end of the period. The market price of the Company's stock was $6.73 on\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nThe change in fair value of the phantom share units has been charged to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and\nComprehensive Income and recorded as a liability included in accrued liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities. The total liability\nassociated with phantom share units at September 30, 2023 is $1,739,000, with $1,196,000 of this amount included in current\naccrued liabilities and the remaining portion of $543,000 included in long-term accrued liabilities.\nThe impact associated with the fair value re-measurement of phantom share units is recorded in selling, general and administrative\nexpenses within the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.

Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company accrues estimates for resolution of any legal and other contingencies when losses are probable and reasonably\nestimable in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies (“ASC 450”). No less than quarterly, the Company reviews the status of\neach significant matter underlying a legal proceeding or claim and assess our potential financial exposure. The Company accrues a\nliability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any legal proceeding or claim is considered probable and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether\nthe amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable, and accruals are based only on the information available to the Company at\nthe time the judgment is made, which may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate or unanticipated events and circumstances may\noccur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, the outcome of legal proceedings is\ninherently uncertain, and we may incur substantial defense costs and expenses defending any of these matters.\nLegal Proceedings\nAs previously disclosed, the Company (through its subsidiary Sleep Management LLC) submitted a purchase order (the “Purchase\nOrder”) in March 2020 to Vyaire Medical, Inc. d/b/a CareFusion Respiratory Technologies (“Vyaire”) for respiratory equipment. The\nCompany ultimately prepaid $1.4 million towards the delivery of such respiratory equipment. Vyaire was unable or unwilling to\ndeliver the vast majority of the respiratory equipment referenced in the Purchase Order, and also refused to refund the prepayment\namount (less the amounts paid for equipment actually received). On July 29, 2020, the Company (through its subsidiary Sleep\nManagement LLC) filed a lawsuit against Vyaire in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana (the\n“Court”). This lawsuit was dismissed on December 8, 2020 in connection with the commencement of the lawsuit filed by the\nCompany (through its subsidiary Sleep Management) on November 5, 2020, against Vyaire in the 15th Judicial District Court for\nthe Parish of Lafayette, Louisiana (the “State Court”) seeking damages for breach of contract and seeking a declaratory judgment\nthat the Company is not required to pay any further funds to Vyaire. On December 28, 2020, Vyaire filed its Answer, Affirmative\nDefenses, and Reconventional Demand (“Reconventional Demand”) with the State Court alleging breach of contract and seeking\ndamages of $4.7 million, purportedly for the improper cancellation of the Purchase Order. The Company filed its Answer to the\nReconventional Demand on February 12, 2021 and the parties completed discovery on July 17, 2023. The State Court issued an\norder on September 5, 2023 granting the Company Partial Summary Judgment finding that Vyaire breached the contract. The\nremaining issue of the damages suffered by the Company as a result of the breach will be determined at a non-jury trial pending\nVyaire’s interlocutory appeal of the State Court’s partial summary judgment ruling.\nThe Company continues to believe that it has valid legal and equitable grounds to recover its outstanding prepayment as a result of\nVyaire’s failure to deliver the vast majority of the respiratory equipment referenced in the Purchase Order. The Company has\ndetermined that a loss related to the Reconventional Demand is not probable, and thus has not accrued a liability related to this\nclaim. Although a loss may be reasonably possible, the Company does not have sufficient information to determine the amount or\nrange of reasonably possible loss with respect to the Reconventional Demand given that the dispute is in the early stages of the\nlegal process. As of September 30, 2023, outstanding funds in the amount of $0.9 million related to undelivered respiratory\nequipment are included within other long-term assets.\nPage 24\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nGovernmental and Regulatory Matters\nFrom time to time the Company is involved in various external governmental investigations, audits and reviews. Reviews, audits\nand investigations of this sort can lead to government actions, which can result in the assessment of recoupment of\nreimbursement, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way the Company\nconducts business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs.\nIn May of 2021, a final report and recommendation (“Report”) was issued by the OIG regarding an audit by OIG of claims relating to\n100 of the Company’s non-invasive ventilation at home (“NIVH”) patients. The OIG asserted that most of the sampled Medicare\nclaims submitted for the monthly rental of non-invasive ventilators did not comply with Medicare requirements. The Company firmly\nbelieved that the Report ignored each patient’s diagnosis and supporting documentation of that diagnosis from treating and\nprescribing physicians and applied clinical guidelines that were contrary to CMS’s accepted standard of care. In late June of 2021,\nthe Company received initial request letters from DME Medicare Administrative Contractors (\"MACs\") referencing the Report and\nrequesting repayment of purported overpayments. The Company responded to each initial request by submitting a rebuttal and by\nfiling a redetermination appeal as prescribed by the initial request letters and by statute. In September 2021, the MACs informed\nthe Company of unfavorable decisions with respect to the redetermination appeals. In November 2021, the Company filed\nReconsideration Appeals with CMS's designated Qualified Independent Contractor (\"QIC\"). Based on its review, the QIC\ndetermined that approximately 77% of the claims it reviewed were medically necessary and properly payable under Medicare rules\nand regulations, overturning OIG’s and the MACs' initial recommendations and determinations. As a result of the QIC's\nreconsideration findings, reduced and recalculated principal overpayment requests totaling $1.1 million were issued by the MACs.\nIn order to limit the assessment of interest during the appeals period, the Company remitted the associated funds to the MACs. In\nDecember 2022, an Administrative Law Judge overturned all of the remaining appealed claims and instructed the MACs to refund\nall funds previously remitted by the Company. Accordingly, the funds remitted to the MACs are recorded in Prepaid expenses and\nother assets at December 31, 2022 and were received during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n10. Income Taxes\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded income tax expense of $2.5 million, which includes a\ndiscrete tax benefit of $0.3 million associated with stock-based compensation arrangements. Excluding the impact of the discrete\ntaxes, the effective rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is 29.4%. The effective rate differs from the amount\ncomputed by applying the statutory federal and state income tax rates to ordinary income before the provision for income taxes due\nto permanent non-deductible differences. The Company's effective tax rate is based on forecasted annual results which may\nfluctuate significantly through the rest of the year.\nAt September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no amounts recorded for uncertain tax positions and does not expect any\nmaterial changes in uncertain tax benefits during the next 12 months. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to\nincome tax matters in income tax expense. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in various\nstates. The Company is generally not subject to examination by taxing authorities for years prior to 2020.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that the Company believes that these assets are more likely than not to\nbe realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future\nreversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent\noperations.\n11. Earnings Per Share\nIncome per common share is calculated using earnings for the year divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding\nduring the year. Using the treasury stock method, diluted income per share amounts are calculated giving effect to the potential\ndilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to issue common shares were exercised or converted to common shares by\nassuming the proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs are used to purchase common shares\nat the prevailing market rate.\nPage 25\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nThe following reflects the earnings and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:\nThree Months Ended September Nine Months Ended September\n30, 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nNumerator - basic and diluted:\nNet income attributable to shareholders $ 2,919 $ 1,055 $ 6,766 $ 3,784\nDenominator:\nBasic weighted-average number of common shares 38,438,058 38,232,788 38,307,343 38,870,949\nDiluted weighted-average number of shares 40,420,615 39,583,438 40,391,729 39,852,297\nBasic earnings per share $ 0.08 $ 0.03 $ 0.18 $ 0.10\nDiluted earnings per share $ 0.07 $ 0.03 $ 0.17 $ 0.09\nDenominator calculation from basic to diluted:\nBasic weighted-average number of common shares 38,438,058 38,232,788 38,307,343 38,870,949\nStock options and other dilutive securities 1,982,557 1,350,650 2,084,386 981,348\nDiluted weighted-average number of shares 40,420,615 39,583,438 40,391,729 39,852,297\nAnti-dilutive shares excluded from the calculation consisted of dilutive employee stock options and RSUs that were de minimis in all\nperiods presented.\nPage 26\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nItem 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with, and is\nqualified entirely by, our condensed consolidated financial statements (including Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements) and the other consolidated financial information under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Some of the\ninformation in this discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Actual results\nand timing of events could differ from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the\nfollowing discussion and analysis.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements and information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the\nmeaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or \"forward-looking information\" as such term is defined in\napplicable Canadian securities legislation (collectively, \"forward-looking statements\"). Any statements other than statements of\nhistorical information, including those that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives,\nassumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking and may involve estimates,\nassumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-\nlooking statements. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly\nupdate or revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events\nor otherwise, except as required by applicable law.\nForward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance and reflect the expectations or beliefs of management\nregarding future events, and include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: operating results; profitability; financial\ncondition and resources; anticipated needs for working capital; liquidity; capital resources; capital expenditures; milestones;\nlicensing milestones; information with respect to future growth and growth strategies; anticipated trends in our industry; our future\nfinancing plans; timelines; currency fluctuations; government regulation; unanticipated expenses; commercial disputes or claims;\nlimitations on insurance coverage or other reimbursement; and availability of cash flow to fund capital requirements.\nOften, but not always, forward-looking information can be identified by the use of words such as “plans”, “expects”, “is expected”,\n“budget”, “potential”, “scheduled”, “estimates”, “forecasts”, “intends”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “projects”, or the negatives thereof or\nvariations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results “will”, “should”, “may”, “could”, “would”,\n“might” or “will be taken”, “occur” or “be achieved” or the negative of these terms or comparable terminology.\nForward-looking statements are based on the reasonable assumptions, estimates, analysis and opinions of management made in\nlight of its experience and its perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments, as well as other factors that\nmanagement believes to be relevant and reasonable in the circumstances at the date that such statements are made, but which\nmay prove to be incorrect. We believe that the assumptions and expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are\nreasonable. We cannot assure you, however, that such statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events\ncould differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-\nlooking statements.\nPage 27\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nBy their nature, forward-looking statements involve numerous assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and\nspecific, including those identified under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the other\ndocuments we file with the SEC, including under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, and with the securities regulatory authorities in certain provinces of Canada, which contribute to the possibility\nthat the predicted outcomes may not occur or may be delayed. The risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are\nbeyond our control, that could influence actual results include, but are not limited to: the general business, market and economic\nconditions in the regions in which the we operate; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by governmental\nauthorities, individuals and companies in response to the pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations,\nincluding on our patient base, revenues, employees, and equipment and supplies; significant capital requirements and operating\nrisks that we may be subject to; our ability to implement business strategies and pursue business opportunities; volatility in the\nmarket price of our common shares; our novel business model; the state of the capital markets; the availability of funds and\nresources to pursue operations; reductions in reimbursement rates and audits of reimbursement claims by various governmental\nand private payor entities; dependence on few payors; possible new drug discoveries; dependence on key suppliers; granting of\npermits and licenses in a highly regulated business; competition; disruptions in or attacks (including cyber-attacks) on our\ninformation technology, internet, network access or other voice or data communications systems or services; the evolution of\nvarious types of fraud or other criminal behavior to which we are exposed; difficulty integrating newly acquired businesses; the\nimpact of new and changes to, or application of, current laws and regulations; the overall difficult litigation and regulatory\nenvironment; increased competition; increased funding costs and market volatility due to market illiquidity and competition for\nfunding; critical accounting estimates and changes to accounting standards, policies, and methods used by us; our status as an\nemerging growth company and a smaller reporting company; and the occurrence of natural and unnatural catastrophic events or\nhealth epidemics or concerns, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and claims resulting from such events or concerns, as well as\nother general economic, market and business conditions; and other factors beyond our control.\nGeneral Matters\nIn this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" and \"our\" refer\nto Viemed Healthcare, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nWe were incorporated on December 14, 2016 pursuant to the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). As of June 30, 2020,\nwe determined that we no longer qualify as a \"foreign private issuer,\" as defined in Rule 3b-4 of the Exchange Act, for the purposes\nof the informational requirements of the Exchange Act. As a result, effective January 1, 2021, we became subject to the proxy\nsolicitation rules under Section 14 of the Exchange Act and Regulation FD, and our officers, directors, and principal shareholders\nbecame subject to the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. We will\ncontinue to file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K with the SEC and\nwith the relevant Canadian securities regulatory authorities on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval\n(SEDAR).\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the JOBS Act and a \"smaller reporting company\" under Rule 12b-2 of the\nExchange Act, and as such, we have elected to comply with certain reduced U.S. public company reporting requirements.\nUnless otherwise noted herein, all references to \"$\" or \"USD\" are to the currency of the United States and references to \"CAD$\" or\n\"Canadian dollars\" are to the currency of Canada.\nOverview\nWe provide an array of home medical equipment, services and supplies, specializing in post-acute respiratory care services in the\nUnited States. Our primary objective is to focus on the organic growth of the business and thereby solidify our position as one of\nthe United States’ largest providers of in-home therapy for patients suffering from respiratory diseases. Our respiratory care\nprograms are designed specifically for payors to have the ability to treat patients in the home for less total cost and with a superior\nquality of care. Our services include respiratory disease management (through the rental of various HME devices), neuromuscular\ncare, in-home sleep testing and sleep apnea treatment, oxygen therapy, and the sale of associated supplies.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue through the rental of non-invasive and invasive ventilators which represented 57.3% and\n66.7% of our traditional revenue, excluding COVID-19 response sales and services, for the three months ended September 30,\n2023 and 2022, respectively, and 59.9% and 68.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We\ncombine the benefits of home ventilation support with licensed Respiratory Therapists (\"RTs\") to drive improved patient outcomes\nand reduce costly hospital readmissions.\nPage 28\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nWe expect to grow through expansion of existing service areas as well as in new territories through a cost efficient launch that\nreduces location expenses. We currently serve patients in all 50 states. We expect to continue to employ more RTs in order to\nassure our high service model is accomplished in the home. As of September 30, 2023, we employed 374 licensed RTs,\nrepresenting approximately 38% of our company-wide employee count. By focusing overhead costs on personnel that service the\npatient rather than physical location costs, we anticipate that we will efficiently scale our business in regions that are currently not\nbeing effectively serviced.\nThe continued trend of servicing patients in the home rather than in hospitals is aligned with our business objective and we\nanticipate that this trend will continue to offer growth opportunities for us. We expect to continue to be a solution to the rising health\ncosts in the United States by offering more cost effective, home based solutions while increasing the quality of life for patients\nfighting serious respiratory diseases.\nTrends Affecting our Business\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Various policies and initiatives\nwere implemented to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, the postponement of non-\nessential medical surgeries, limiting access to medical facilities, and adoption of social distancing and remote working policies.\nEmployee and patient safety is our first priority, and as a result, we put preparedness plans in place for our employees, especially\nour clinical personnel, and modified our clinical protocols to limit unnecessary patient encounters. On May 11, 2023, the COVID-19\nPublic Health Emergency declared by the Secretary of HHS under Public Health Service Act section 319 (\"COVID-19 PHE\") ended.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has announced in the Federal Register that the Emergency Use Authorization for certain\nventilators and PAP and RAD devices will be in effect until November 7, 2023, 180 days beyond the end of the COVID-19 PHE. At\nthe end of the COVID-19 PHE, many waivers and flexibilities available during the COVID-19 pandemic will become unavailable.\nWhile COVID-19 related measures have not had a material impact on our consolidated operating results for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, we cannot predict at this time the impact that the end of the COVID-19 PHE will have on our business and\nfinancial condition. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that demand for our products and services will continue or that we will be\nable to maintain operations necessary to satisfy such demand, including sufficient personnel, supply chains and distributions\nchannels.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant disruptions and volatility in capital and financial markets. Broad economic factors\nresulting from the current COVID-19 pandemic, including high unemployment and underemployment levels and reduced consumer\nspending and confidence, could also affect our service mix, revenue mix, payor mix and patient base, as well as our ability to\ncollect outstanding receivables. Business closures and layoffs in the geographic areas in which we operate may lead to increases\nin the uninsured and under-insured populations and adversely affect demand for our services, as well as the ability of patients and\nother payors to pay for services rendered. Any increase in the amount or deterioration in the collectability of patient accounts\nreceivable will adversely affect our financial results and require an increased level of working capital. In addition, we may\nexperience supply chain disruptions, including delays and price increases in equipment and supplies. Staffing, equipment and\nsupplies shortages may also impact our ability to assess potential patients in hospitals and set up and treat patients in the home. If\nCOVID-19 intensifies or if the response to contain the COVID-19 pandemic is unsuccessful, we could experience a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For additional information, see Part II - Item 1A. “Risk\nFactors.”\nThe CARES Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, provides a substantial stimulus and assistance package intended\nto address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including tax relief and government loans, grants and investments. We are\ncontinuing to monitor any effects or requirements that may result from the CARES Act as many of the provisions in the CARES Act\nare temporary and may require us to modify our operations and compliance procedures. CMS and other federal agencies have and\nare likely to issue rules and regulations to implement the CARES Act. The impact of these rules and regulations are unknown and\nmay affect us. To the extent these provisions will expire as stated in the CARES Act, we will be required to unwind any changes.\nIn 2019, CMS announced the inclusion of non-invasive ventilator products on the list of products subject to the competitive bidding\nprogram in Round 2021 which covers the period of January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2023. On March 9, 2020, CMS\nannounced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States President’s exercise of the Defense Production Act, public\nconcern regarding access to ventilators, and the non-invasive ventilators product category being new to the competitive bidding\nprogram, non-invasive ventilators were removed as a product category from Round 2021. On October 27, 2020, CMS announced\nthat it had removed 13 of the 15 remaining product categories from Round 2021, including oxygen and PAP devices, because the\npayment amounts did not achieve expected savings. As a result of these announcements, we retain the ability to continue to\nfurnish non-invasive ventilators and oxygen and PAP devices for all of our Medicare accredited areas, however, we are uncertain if\nnon-invasive ventilators, oxygen, and PAP devices will be included in future competitive bidding programs. The current Round 2021\nPage 29\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\ncontracts expire on December 31, 2023 and CMS has not announced a new round of competitive bidding. Historically, CMS\nannounces new rounds of competitive bidding and starts the process approximately 18 months prior to the contract start date.\nThe CARES Act introduced a new blended rate for HME furnished in non-rural or contiguous non-competitive bidding areas that is\nbased on 75% of the adjusted fee schedule amount and 25% of the unadjusted fee schedule amount. The Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, 2023 further extended the 75/25 blended Medicare reimbursement rate in non-competitive bidding/non-rural\nareas through the end of the COVID-19 PHE or December 31, 2023, whichever is later, after which it will revert to 100% of the\nMedicare fee schedule.\nThe CARES Act also provided for a temporary suspension of the 2% payment sequestration adjustment currently applied to all\nMedicare fee-for-service claims. In December 2021, President Biden signed into law legislation that extended the suspension on\nthe 2 percent payment sequestration through March 31, 2022. The payment sequestration adjustment was fixed at 1 percent from\nApril 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022 and it returned to 2 percent on July 1, 2022.\nThe Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (\"PAYGO\") required that automatic payment cuts of 4% be put into place if a statutory\naction is projected to create a net increase in the deficit over either five or 10 years. The enactment of the American Rescue Plan\nAct in 2021 would have triggered PAYGO sequestration in 2021. In the Protecting Medicare & American Farmers from Sequester\nCuts Act, Congress delayed the PAYGO sequestration until January 1, 2023. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 further\nprevented implementation of the PAYGO Medicare 4% sequester through the end of 2024. If not renewed, the PAYGO payment\nadjustment could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn its 2023 DMEPOS Fee Schedule, CMS also announced the fee schedule adjustment based on the annual change to the\nConsumer Pricing Index for all urban areas. Items that were subject to the competitive bidding program in former competitive\nbidding areas will receive a 6.4% reimbursement rate increase. Items that were subject to the competitive bidding program in non-\ncompetitive bidding areas received a 9.1% reimbursement rate increase. Items not subject to the competitive bidding program\nreceived an 8.7% reimbursement rate increase.\nWhile we cannot predict what Medicare payment rates or coverage determinations will be in effect in future years, changes to\npayment rates or benefit coverages may materially impact its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe below table highlights summary financial and operational metrics for the last eight quarters.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except vent patients)\nSeptember 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31,\nFor the quarter ended 2023 2023 2023 2022 2022 2022 2022 2021\nFinancial Information:\nRevenue $ 49,402 $ 43,311 $ 39,556 $ 37,508 $ 35,759 $ 33,310 $ 32,255 $ 31,962\nGross Profit $ 30,562 $ 26,106 $ 24,004 $ 22,896 $ 21,651 $ 20,390 $ 19,743 $ 19,662\nGross Profit % 62 % 60 % 61 % 61 % 61 % 61 % 61 % 62 %\nNet Income $ 2,919 $ 2,330 $ 1,517 $ 2,438 $ 1,055 $ 967 $ 1,762 $ 4,087\nCash (As of) $ 10,078 $ 10,224 $ 23,544 $ 16,914 $ 21,478 $ 21,922 $ 29,248 $ 28,408\nTotal Assets (As of) $ 149,400 $ 149,117 $ 124,634 $ 117,043 $ 119,419 $ 115,904 $ 119,007 $ 117,962\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) $ 12,081 $ 9,810 $ 8,328 $ 9,306 $ 6,982 $ 6,458 $ 7,273 $ 9,549\nOperational Information:\nVent Patients(2) 10,244 10,005 9,337 9,306 9,127 8,837 8,434 8,405\n(1) Refer to \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section below for definition of Adjusted EBITDA.\n(2) Vent Patients represents the number of active ventilator patients on recurring billing service at the end of each calendar quarter.\nPage 30\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 and 2022:\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n% of Total % of Total $ %\n2023 Revenue 2022 Revenue Change Change\nRevenue $ 49,402 100.0 % $ 35,759 100.0 % $ 13,643 38.2 %\nCost of revenue 18,840 38.1 % 14,108 39.5 % 4,732 33.5 %\nGross profit 30,562 61.9 % 21,651 60.5 % 8,911 41.2 %\nSelling, general and administrative 23,654 47.9 % 17,677 49.4 % 5,977 33.8 %\nResearch and development 593 1.2 % 670 1.9 % (77) (11.5) %\nStock-based compensation 1,453 2.9 % 1,309 3.7 % 144 11.0 %\nDepreciation 419 0.8 % 291 0.8 % 128 44.0 %\nLoss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment 278 0.6 % 292 0.8 % (14) (4.8) %\nOther expense (income) (41) (0.1) % (57) (0.2) % 16 (28.1) %\nIncome from operations 4,206 8.5 % 1,469 4.1 % 2,737 186.3 %\nNon-operating income and expenses\nIncome from equity method investments 270 0.5 % 84 0.2 % 186 221.4 %\nInterest expense, net (237) (0.5) % (42) (0.1) % (195) 464.3 %\nNet income before taxes 4,239 8.6 % 1,511 4.2 % 2,728 180.5 %\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes 1,320 2.7 % 456 1.3 % 864 189.5 %\nNet income $ 2,919 5.9 % $ 1,055 3.0 % $ 1,864 176.7 %\nRevenue\nThe following table summarizes our revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n% of Total % of Total $ %\n2023 Revenue 2022 Revenue Change Change\nNet revenue from rentals\nVentilator rentals, non-invasive and invasive $ 28,322 57.3 % $ 23,869 66.7 % $ 4,453 18.7 %\nOther durable medical equipment rentals 11,119 22.5 % 5,882 16.5 % 5,237 89.0 %\nNet revenue from sales and services\nEquipment and supply sales 7,742 15.7 % 3,649 10.2 % 4,093 112.2 %\nService revenues 2,219 4.5 % 2,359 6.6 % (140) (5.9) %\nTotal net revenue $ 49,402 100.0 % $ 35,759 100.0 % $ 13,643 38.2 %\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, net revenue totaled $49.4 million, an increase of $13.6 million (or 38.2%) from\nthe comparable period in 2022. The net revenue growth was associated with an increase in ventilator rental revenue of $4.5\nmillion (or 18.7%) which can be primarily attributed to the organic expansion of our active ventilator patient base. In addition to the\nventilator rental revenue growth, net revenue growth was also driven by an increase in rental revenue from other DME of $5.2\nmillion (or 89.0%), consisting of rental revenue from oxygen therapy, PAP, and percussion vest activities associated with our\ncontinued national organic expansion of services and the acquisition of HMP. Equipment and supply sales increased by $4.1 million\n(or 112.2%), primarily driven by the continued growth of the PAP resupply program and other sleep offerings. While ventilator\nrentals continue to make up the majority of our revenue, the growth of PAP and oxygen related sales and services is contributing\nsignificantly to the diversity of our overall revenue mix. As we continue to expand geographically into new territories and further\nexpand our presence in our existing territories, we expect continued growth in our active ventilator patient base and our other\nrespiratory offerings.\nPage 31\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nCost of revenue and gross profit\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, cost of revenue totaled $18.8 million, an increase of $4.7 million (or 33.5%) from\nthe comparable period in 2022. Overall gross profit percentage increased from 60.5% in the three months ended September 30,\n2022 to 61.9% in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in gross profit percentage is primarily attributable to\nthe migration of our revenue mix, which reflects our deliberate organic and inorganic efforts towards product and service\ndiversification, aimed at further enhancing our market position. Gross profit percentage is expected to remain relatively stable\nthrough the end of 2023 due to subsiding inflationary cost pressures and the positive effects of seasonality in collection rates,\npartially offset by the impacts of continued product and service diversification.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 47.9% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 compared to 49.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Selling, general and administrative\nexpenses totaled $23.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $6.0 million (or 33.8%) from the\ncomparable prior period. The increase in overall selling, general and administrative expense as compared to the prior period is\nprimarily attributable to additional employee related expenses to accommodate the overall growth of the Company. Our full time\nemployee count increased from 722 on September 30, 2022 to 988 on September 30, 2023, an increase of 36.8%, which was\npartially due to the acquisition of HMP on June 1, 2023. Employee compensation expenses increased $2.4 million (or 22%) as a\nresult of the increase in our employee headcount and increases in incentive and volume based compensation. We expect that\ncurrent year selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will continue to improve through the end of\n2023 due to increased efficiencies and costs stabilization relative to revenue growth.\nResearch and development\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, research and development expense totaled $0.6 million, a decrease of\n$0.1 million (or 11.5%) from the comparable period in 2022. As we continue to invest in research and development related projects\nto support our technology initiatives, we expect that associated costs will remain consistent in 2023 relative to 2022 costs.\nStock-based compensation\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, stock-based compensation totaled $1.5 million, an increase of 11.0% from the\ncomparable period in 2022. We anticipate that as we expand our workforce, incorporating stock-based awards as a component of\nemployee compensation, stock-based compensation expenses will correspondingly rise. Historically, revenue growth has outpaced\nthe growth in stock-based compensation, and as a result, the percentage of stock-based compensation relative to revenue is\nexpected to continue declining.\nInterest expense, net\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, net interest expense totaled $0.2 million, As a result of continued paydowns on\ndebt issued to fund the acquisition of HMP, we expect quarterly net interest expense to decrease for the remainder of 2023.\nProvision for income taxes\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, the provision for income taxes was a $1.3 million expense, compared to $0.5\nmillion during the comparable period in 2022. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the increase in pre-tax\nincome. Our annual estimated effective tax rate for 2023 is 29.4%.\nNet income\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, net income was $2.9 million, an increase of $1.9 million (or 176.7%) from the\ncomparable period in 2022. Net income as a percentage of net revenue increased from 3.0% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 to 5.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to improvements in selling, general,\nand administrative expenses associated with increased efficiencies and stabilizing costs.\nPage 32\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nComparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 and 2022:\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n% of Total % of Total $ %\n2023 Revenue 2022 Revenue Change Change\nRevenue $ 132,269 100.0 % $ 101,324 100.0 % $ 30,945 30.5 %\nCost of revenue 51,597 39.0 % 39,540 39.0 % 12,057 30.5 %\nGross profit 80,672 61.0 % 61,784 61.0 % 18,888 30.6 %\nSelling, general and administrative 63,979 48.4 % 50,989 50.3 % 12,990 25.5 %\nResearch and development 2,131 1.6 % 1,974 1.9 % 157 8.0 %\nStock-based compensation 4,315 3.3 % 3,885 3.8 % 430 11.1 %\nDepreciation 957 0.7 % 771 0.8 % 186 24.1 %\nLoss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment 373 0.3 % 168 0.2 % 205 NM\nOther expense (income) (124) (0.1) % (721) (0.7) % 597 (82.8) %\nIncome from operations 9,041 6.8 % 4,718 4.7 % 4,323 91.6 %\nNon-operating expenses\nIncome from equity method investments 442 0.3 % 853 0.8 % (411) NM\nInterest expense, net (168) (0.1) % (165) (0.2) % (3) 1.8 %\nNet income before taxes 9,315 7.0 % 5,406 5.3 % 3,909 72.3 %\nProvision for income taxes 2,549 1.9 % 1,622 1.6 % 927 57.2 %\nNet income $ 6,766 5.1 % $ 3,784 3.7 % $ 2,982 78.8 %\nRevenue\nThe following table summarizes our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n% of Total % of Total $ %\n2023 Revenue 2022 Revenue Change Change\nNet revenue from rentals\nVentilator rentals, non-invasive and invasive $ 79,181 59.9 % $ 68,123 67.2 % $ 11,058 16.2 %\nOther durable medical equipment rentals 26,441 20.0 % 15,153 15.0 % 11,288 74.5 %\nNet revenue from sales and services\nEquipment and supply sales 19,287 14.6 % 9,931 9.8 % 9,356 94.2 %\nCOVID-19 response sales and services — — % 2,278 2.2 % (2,278) NM\nService revenues 7,360 5.5 % 5,839 5.8 % 1,521 26.0 %\nTotal net revenue $ 132,269 100.0 % $ 101,324 100.0 % $ 30,945 30.5 %\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, revenue totaled $132.3 million, an increase of $30.9 million (or 30.5%) from the\ncomparable period in 2022. Excluding COVID-19 response sales and services revenue, net revenue increased $33.2 million (or\n33.5%) from the comparable period in 2022. The net revenue increase was comprised of an increase in ventilator rental revenue of\n$11.1 million (or 16.2%), rental revenue from other DME of $11.3 million (or 74.5%), equipment and supply sales of $9.4 million (or\n94.2%), and service revenue of $1.5 million (or 26.0%). The growth in other durable medical equipment rentals has been primarily\ndriven by the continued national expansion of PAP, oxygen therapy, and percussion vest activities and the acquisition of HMP. The\nincrease in equipment sales and supplies is primarily driven by the success of our PAP resupply program and other sleep offerings.\nThe increase in service revenue is primarily due to the addition of our healthcare staffing offerings. While ventilator rentals continue\nto make up the majority of our revenue, the organic and acquired growth of PAP and oxygen related sales and services, as well as\nour healthcare staffing offerings, is contributing significantly to the diversity of our overall revenue mix. As we continue to expand\ngeographically into new territories and further expand our presence in our existing territories, we expect continued growth in our\nactive ventilator patient base and our other respiratory offerings.\nPage 33\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nThere were no COVID-19 response sales and services during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $2.3\nmillion during the comparable nine month period in 2022. The magnitude and persistence of future COVID-19 response sales and\nservices revenue remains uncertain and is dependent on the intensity and length of the COVID-19 pandemic and the demand for\nongoing services from primarily governmental customers.\nCost of revenue and gross profit\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cost of revenue totaled $51.6 million, an increase of $12.1 million (or 30.5%) from\nthe comparable period in 2022.

The overall increase in selling, general and administrative expense as compared to the prior period is\nprimarily due to additional employee related expenses to accommodate the overall growth of the Company and transaction costs\nrelated to the acquisition of HMP. Our full time employee count increased from 722 on September 30, 2022 to 988 on September\n30, 2023, an increase of 36.8%, which was partially due to the acquisition of HMP on June 1, 2023. Employee compensation\nexpenses increased $7.8 million (or 25%) as a result of the increase in our employee headcount and increases in incentive and\nvolume based compensation. We expect that current year selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue\nwill continue to improve through the end of 2023 due to increased efficiencies and costs stabilization relative to revenue growth.\nResearch and development\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, research and development expense totaled $2.1 million, an increase of $0.2\nmillion (or 8.0%) from the comparable period in 2022.

The resulting decrease in the overall effective tax rate as a percentage of pre-tax\nincome was due to the impact of discrete tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation between periods. Our annual\nestimated effective tax rate for 2023 is 29.4%.\nPage 34\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nNet income\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net income was $6.8 million, an increase of $3.0 million (or 78.8%) from the\ncomparable period in 2022. Net income as a percentage of revenue increased from 3.7% for the nine months ended September\n30, 2022 to 5.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to improvements in selling, general, and\nadministrative expenses associated with increased efficiencies and stabilizing costs.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company uses Adjusted EBITDA, which is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") to analyze its financial results and believes that it is useful to investors, as a\nsupplement to U.S. GAAP measures. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information with respect to the\nCompany’s operating performance as viewed by management, including a view of the Company’s business that is not dependent\non the impact of the Company’s capitalization structure and items that are not part of the Company’s day-to-day operations.\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA (i) to compare the Company’s operating performance on a consistent basis, (ii) to calculate\nincentive compensation for the Company’s employees, (iii) for planning purposes, including the preparation of the Company’s\ninternal annual operating budget, and (iv) to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the Company’s operational strategies.\nAccordingly, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in understanding and evaluating the\nCompany’s operating performance in the same manner as management. In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, certain items (mostly\nnon-cash) are excluded from net income including interest, taxes, stock based compensation, and depreciation of property and\nequipment. Beginning with financial results reported for periods in fiscal year 2023, Adjusted EBITDA also excludes transaction\ncosts and expenses related to acquisition and integration efforts associated with recently announced or completed acquisitions.\nThis modification enables investors to compare period-over-period results on a more consistent basis without the effects of\nacquisitions. We have recast Adjusted EBITDA for prior periods when reported to conform to the modified presentation.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of Net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, on a\nhistorical basis for the periods indicated:\nSeptember 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31,\nFor the quarter ended 2023 2023 2023 2022 2022 2022 2022 2021\nNet Income $ 2,919 $ 2,330 $ 1,517 $ 2,438 $ 1,055 $ 967 $ 1,762 $ 4,087\nAdd back:\nDepreciation 5,975 5,207 4,762 4,373 4,120 3,740 3,397 3,120\nInterest expense (income) 237 (20) (49) 32 42 59 64 69\nStock-based compensation(a) 1,453 1,471 1,391 1,317 1,309 1,271 1,305 1,305\nTransaction costs(b) 177 94 206 — — — — —\nIncome tax expense 1,320 728 501 1,146 456 421 745 968\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 12,081 $ 9,810 $ 8,328 $ 9,306 $ 6,982 $ 6,458 $ 7,273 $ 9,549\n(a) Represents non-cash, equity-based compensation expense associated with option and RSU awards.\n(b) Represents transaction costs and expenses related to acquisition and integration efforts associated with recently announced or\ncompleted acquisitions.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in\naccordance with GAAP. It is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an\nalternative to revenue or net income, as applicable, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an\nalternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of the Company's liquidity, and may not be comparable to other\nsimilarly titled measures of other companies or businesses. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA does not\nreflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of ongoing operations; and other\ncompanies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nPage 35\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2023 was $10.1 million, compared to $16.9 million at December 31, 2022. Based on\nour current plan of operations, we believe this amount, when combined with expected cash flows from operations and amounts\navailable under our line of credit will be sufficient to fund our growth strategy and to meet our anticipated operating expenses,\ncapital expenditures, and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months from the date of this filing.

Subsequent to the acquisition, principal payments on the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility were $4.0 million. Additionally,\nprincipal payments on acquired revolving and term loans were $3.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The\nCompany acquired and cancelled 75,235 common shares at a cost of $0.6 million to satisfy employee income tax withholding\nassociated with RSUs vestings while proceeds from the exercise of options during the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nwere $1.2 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $10.4 million.

Net cash used in financing\nactivities during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 also included $1.3 million in principal payments on the Term Note (as\ndefined below).\nSenior Credit Facilities\nOn November 29, 2022, the Company refinanced its existing borrowings under the prior Commercial Business Loan Agreement\nwith Hancock Whitney Bank and entered into a new credit agreement (the \"2022 Senior Credit Facilities\") with the lenders from\ntime to time party thereto, and Regions Bank, as administrative agent and collateral agent, that provides for an up to $30.0 million\nrevolving credit facility (the \"2022 Revolving Credit Facility\") and an up to $30.0 million delayed draw term loan facility (the \"2022\nTerm Loan Facility\"), both maturing in November 2027.\nThe proceeds of the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility may be used to refinance existing indebtedness, for working capital purposes,\ncapital expenditures and other general corporate purposes (including permitted acquisitions), and to pay transaction fees, costs\nand expenses related to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities. The proceeds of the 2022 Term Loan Facility and any additional term\nloans established in accordance with the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities may be used to finance permitted acquisitions and to pay\ntransaction fees, costs and expenses related to such acquisitions. Outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Term Loan Facility and\n2022 Revolving Credit Facility were $4.9 million and $4.0 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2023.\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are Term SOFR (as defined in the 2022 Senior Credit\nFacilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 2.625% to 3.375%, or, at the option of the Company, a Base Rate (as\ndefined in the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 1.625% to 2.375%.\nThe 2022 Senior Credit Facilities require the Company to comply with certain affirmative, as well as certain negative covenants\nthat, among other things, will restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur indebtedness, grant liens,\nmake investments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations and pay dividends and other restricted payments. The 2022\nSenior Credit Facilities also include certain financial covenants, which generally include, but are not limited to the following:\n• Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (defined generally as total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than (i) for\nany fiscal quarter ending during the period from the closing date to and including December 31, 2024, 2.75 to 1.0 and (ii)\nfor any fiscal quarter ending on and after March 31, 2025, 2.50 to 1.0, subject to certain adjustments following a material\nacquisition.\n• Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (defined generally as (a) adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditures minus\ncash taxes to (b) the sum of scheduled principal payments plus cash interest expense plus restricted payments) of not\nless than 1.25:1.0.\nThe Company was in compliance with all covenants under the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities in effect at September 30, 2023.\nPage 37\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nUse of Funds\nOur principal uses of cash are funding the purchase of rental assets and other capital purchases, the repayment of debt, funding of\nbusiness combinations, operations, and other working capital requirements. Our contractual obligations primarily relate to the\nrepayment of existing debt and contractual obligations for operating and finance leases. Total outstanding borrowings under our\ndebt arrangements as of September 30, 2023 were $9.9 million, of which $1.8 million is due within 12 months. Except for the\nfunding of potential business combinations and investments, we anticipate that our operating cash flows will satisfy our material\ncash requirements for the 12 months after September 30, 2023.\nIn addition to our operating cash flows, we may need to raise additional funds to support our contractual obligations and investing\nactivities beyond such 12 month period, and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are\nunable to raise additional funds when needed, our operations and ability to execute our business strategy could be adversely\naffected. We may seek to raise additional funds through equity, equity-linked or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through\nthe incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness would have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could\ncontain covenants that restrict our operations. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders.\nRetirement Plan\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) retirement plan for employees to which eligible employees can contribute a percentage of their\npre-tax compensation. Matching employer contributions to the 401(k) plan totaled $316,000 and $259,000 for the three months\nended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $1,050,000 and $882,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nand 2022, respectively.\nOff balance sheet arrangements\nThe Company has no material undisclosed off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or\nfuture effect on its results of operations or financial condition.\nAccounting and Disclosure Matters\nCritical Accounting Principles and Estimates\nWe are required to disclose “critical accounting estimates” which are estimates made in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and that have had or are reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe follow financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States. The more significant of these policies are summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in\nPart II, Item 8 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Not all significant accounting\npolicies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments. However, the policy noted below could be deemed\nto meet the SEC’s definition of a critical accounting estimate.\nPage 38\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company estimates that a certain portion of receivables from customers may not be collected and maintains an allowance for\ndoubtful accounts. The Company evaluates the net realizable value of accounts receivable as of the date of Consolidated Balance\nSheets. Specifically, we consider historical realization data, including current and historical cash collections, accounts receivable\naging trends, other operating trends and relevant business conditions. Because of continuing changes in the healthcare industry\nand third-party reimbursement, it is possible that the estimates could change, which could have a material impact on the operations\nand cash flows. If circumstances related to certain customers change or actual results differ from expectations, our estimate of the\nrecoverability of receivables could fluctuate from that provided for in our consolidated financial statements. A change in estimate\ncould impact the provision for uncollectible accounts and accounts receivable. The continued volatility in market conditions and\nevolving shifts in credit trends are difficult to predict causing variability and volatility that may have a material impact on our\nallowance for doubtful accounts in future periods. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $11.6 million and $8.5 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and based on our analysis, we believe the reserve is adequate for any exposure to\ncredit losses.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of\nrecently issued accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of\noperations, financial positions and cash flows.\nPage 39\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nNot Applicable.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to\nRule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded:\ni. that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure (a) that information required to be\ndisclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized\nand reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and (b) that such information is accumulated\nand communicated to the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as\nappropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and\nii. that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that the Company's disclosures controls and procedures will detect or\nuncover all failures of persons within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries to disclose material information otherwise\nrequired to be set forth in the Company's periodic reports. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of\ndisclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and\nprocedures.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September\n30, 2023 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial\nreporting.\nPage 40\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to various ongoing or threatened legal actions and other proceedings, including those that\narise in the ordinary course of business, which may include employment matters, breach of contract disputes, as well as\ngovernmental and regulatory matters. Please read Note 9—Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements for more information. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and to outcomes that are not predictable\nwith assurance and that may not be known for extended periods of time.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors\ndiscussed in “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on March\n2, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Except as set forth below, there have been\nno material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in that Annual Report.\nOur strategic growth plan, which involves the acquisition of other businesses, may not succeed.\nThe Company's strategic growth plan calls for significant growth in its business over the next several years through an increase in\nits density in select markets where it is established as well as the expansion of its geographic footprint into new markets. This\ngrowth would place (and has placed) significant demands on the Company’s management team, systems, internal controls and\nfinancial and professional resources. As a result, the Company could be required to incur (and has incurred) expenses for hiring\nadditional qualified personnel, retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems and expanding the\nCompany’s information technology infrastructure. If the Company is unable to effectively manage growth, its financial results could\nbe adversely impacted.\nThe Company’s strategic growth plan contemplates continued growth from future acquisitions of home medical equipment and\nservice providers. The Company may face increased competition for attractive acquisition candidates, which may limit the number\nof acquisition opportunities available to the Company or lead to the payment of higher prices for its acquisitions. Without successful\nacquisitions, the Company’s future growth rate could decline. In addition, the Company cannot guarantee that any future\nacquisitions, if consummated, will result in further growth.\nThe integration of acquisitions requires significant attention from management, may impose substantial demands on the\nCompany’s operations or other projects and may impose challenges on us including, but not limited to, consistencies in business\nstandards, procedures, policies and business cultures. There can be no assurance that any future acquisitions, if consummated,\nwill result in further growth. Specific integration risks relating to the acquisition of other businesses by the Company may include:\ndifficulties related to combining previously separate businesses into a single unit, including patient transitions, product and service\nofferings, distribution and operational capabilities and business cultures; availability of financing to the extent needed to fund\nacquisitions;customer loss and other general business disruption; managing the integration process while completing other\nindependent acquisitions or dispositions; diversion of management’s attention from day-to-day operations; assumption of liabilities\nof an acquired business, including unforeseen or contingent liabilities or liabilities in excess of the amounts estimated; failure to\nrealize anticipated benefits and synergies, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; potentially substantial costs and\nexpenses associated with acquisitions and dispositions; and failure to retain and motivate key employees difficulties in establishing\nand applying the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures to an acquired\nbusiness.\nPage 41\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022\nItem 2.

Nature of Business and Operations\nViemed Healthcare, Inc. (the \"Company\"), through its subsidiaries, is a provider of home medical equipment (\"HME\") and post-\nacute respiratory healthcare services in the United States. The Company’s service offerings are focused on effective in-home\ntreatment with clinical practitioners providing therapy and counseling to patients in their homes using cutting edge technology. The\nCompany currently serves patients in 50 states of the United States. The Company was incorporated under the Business\nCorporations Act (British Columbia) on December 14, 2016. The Company's registered and records office is located at Suite 2800,\nPark Place, 666 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia V6C 2Z7 and its corporate office is located at 625 E. Kaliste Saloom\nRoad, Lafayette, Louisiana 70508.\nThe Company is an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \"JOBS Act\") and a\n\"smaller reporting company\" under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and,\nas such, has elected to comply with certain reduced U.S. public company reporting requirements.\nThe Company’s common shares are traded in the U.S. on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \"VMD\" and in Canada on\nthe Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol \"VMD.TO\".\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and\nfootnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements\nare unaudited, but reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals, which, in the opinion of management, are\nnecessary to present fairly the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nIncome and Comprehensive Income, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity and Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the interim periods presented. The Company's fiscal year ends on December 31. The\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022 was derived from audited consolidated financial statements but\ndoes not include all disclosures required by GAAP. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in\nconjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the report of the Company's independent\nregistered public accounting firm included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe nature of the Company's business is such that the results of any interim period may not be indicative of the results to be\nexpected for the entire year.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany\ntransactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date\nof the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiod. Management bases these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience, existing and known circumstances,\nauthoritative accounting pronouncements and other factors that management believes to be reasonable. Significant areas requiring\nthe use of management estimates relate to revenue recognition, accounts receivable and the related allowance for doubtful\naccounts, income tax provisions, and fair value of financial instruments. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nPage 7\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company’s chief operating decision-makers (\"CODMs\") are its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, who make\nresource allocation decisions and assess performance based on financial information presented on an aggregate basis. There are\nno segment managers who are held accountable by the chief operating decision-makers, or anyone else, for any planning, strategy\nand key decision-making regarding operations. The corporate office is responsible for contract negotiation with vendors and\npayors, corporate compliance with healthcare laws and regulations, and revenue cycle management, among other corporate\nsupporting functions. Accordingly, the Company has a single reportable segment and operating segment structure based on ASC\n280, Segment Reporting.\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts receivable are regularly reviewed for collectability and an allowance is recorded to cover the estimated bad debts and\nbilling modifications. The accounts receivable are presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets net of the allowance\nfor doubtful accounts. It is possible that the estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts could change, which could have a\nmaterial impact on our operations and cash flows.\nThe Company writes off receivables when the likelihood for collection is remote, and when the Company believes collection efforts\nhave been fully exhausted and it does not intend to devote additional resources in attempting to collect. The write-offs are charged\nagainst the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company's evaluation takes into consideration such factors as historical bad debt\nand billing modification experience, national and local economic trends and conditions, industry and regulatory conditions, other\ncollection indicators and information about disaggregated receivables. The complexity of many third-party billing arrangements,\npatient qualification for medical necessity of equipment and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from\ncertain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded.\nThe estimates and charge-offs for the allowance for doubtful accounts for each reporting period were as follows:\nJune 30, 2023 June 30, 2022\nBalance, beginning of year $ 8,483 $ 7,031\nProvision for uncollectible accounts 7,579 6,300\nAmounts charged off (5,055) (3,948)\nBalance, end of period $ 11,007 $ 9,383\nIncluded in accounts receivable at June 30, 2023 are amounts due from Medicare and Medicaid representing 35% and 6%,\nrespectively, and 41% combined, of total outstanding receivables. As of December 31, 2022, 48% of total outstanding receivables\nwere amounts due from Medicare and Medicaid.\nRevenues from Medicare and Medicaid as percentages of the Company's traditional revenue streams, excluding COVID-19\nresponse sales and services, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nThree Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nMedicare revenues 44 % 46 % 45 % 47 %\nMedicaid revenues 9 % 9 % 9 % 9 %\nTotal Medicare and Medicaid 53 % 55 % 54 % 56 %\nInventory\nInventory represents non-serialized supplies that consist of equipment parts, consumables, and associated product supplies and is\nexpensed at the time of sale or use. The Company values inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Obsolete and\nunserviceable inventories are valued at estimated net realizable value.\nPage 8\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment is presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at historic cost less accumulated\ndepreciation. Major renewals and improvements that extend the useful life of assets are capitalized to the respective property\naccounts, while maintenance and repairs, which do not extend the useful life of the respective assets, are expensed as incurred.\nManagement has estimated the useful lives of equipment leased to customers. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Property and equipment are amortized on a straight-line basis over\ntheir estimated useful lives.\nDepreciation of medical equipment commences at the date of service, which represents the date that the asset has been delivered\nto a patient and is put in use and continues through the useful life of the asset. Property and equipment with definite useful lives are\ntested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nEquity investments\nEquity investments on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are comprised of an investment accounted for under the\nequity method and equity investments without readily determinable fair values accounted for under the measurement alternative\ndescribed in ASC 321-10-35-2.\nThe following table details the Company’s equity investments:\nJune 30, 2023 December 31, 2022\nEquity method investments $ 595 $ 816\nOther equity investments 1,347 1,339\nBalance, end of period $ 1,942 $ 2,155\nThe Company's equity method investments include a 49% equity interest in Solvet Services, LLC, an entity which provides health\ncare support services to state and federal governments. Investments accounted for under the equity method are investments in\nunconsolidated entities over whose operating and financial policies the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence but\nnot control. Equity method investments are initially measured at cost in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with any\nsubsequent adjustments made to the carrying amount of the investment for the Company’s proportionate share of income or loss.\nDistributions received from the investee reduce the Company’s carrying value of the investment. The Company has recognized its\nshare of income or loss on the gain (loss) from equity method investments within non-operating expenses in the Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Income. Equity method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investments may exceed the fair value. No events or changes have occurred\nas of June 30, 2023 that would impair the carrying value of equity method investments.\nOther equity investments include an equity interest in VeruStat, Inc., a remote patient monitoring entity, and an equity interest in\nDMEscripts, LLC, an e-prescribing platform. Other equity investments are investments without a readily determinable fair value\nwhich do not qualify for the practical expedient in ASC 820. For these investments, the Company has elected the measurement\nalternative which measures the investment at cost, less any impairment. ASU 2019-04 clarifies that if an entity identifies observable\nprice changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer, it must measure its equity\ninvestment at fair value in accordance with ASC 820 as of the date that the observable transaction occurred. The Company was\nnot aware of any impairment or observable price change adjustments that needed to be made as of June 30, 2023 on its\ninvestments in equity securities without a readily determinable fair value.\nDebt Investment\nThe Company's debt investment is a variable rate secured convertible note issued by Healthcare DX, Inc. (d/b/a ModoHealth) on\nDecember 21, 2022, classified as an available-for-sale debt instrument. Accrued interest is due upon the 18 month maturity of the\nnote and is included in the amortized cost basis at each reporting period. At each financial statement date until a conversion event,\nthe debt instrument is required to be remeasured at fair value. Changes in unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated\nother comprehensive income, net of tax effect, until realized.\nPage 9\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nValuation of Goodwill\nGoodwill resulting from business combinations is not amortized, rather, it is assessed for impairment annually and upon the\noccurrence of a triggering event or change in circumstances indicating a possible impairment. Such triggering events potentially\nwarranting an annual or interim goodwill impairment assessment include, among other factors, declines in historical or projected\nrevenue, operating income or cash flows, and sustained decreases in the Company’s stock price or market capitalization. Such\nchanges in circumstance can include, among others, changes in the legal environment, reimbursement environment, operating\nperformance, and/or future prospects. The Company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill during the fourth\nquarter of each year. The impairment assessment can be performed on either a quantitative or qualitative basis. The Company first\nassesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. If\ndetermined necessary, the Company applies the quantitative impairment test to identify and measure the amount of impairment, if\nany. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors,\nsuch as estimates of a reporting unit's fair value and judgment about impairment triggering events. As a result, there can be no\nassurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual or interim goodwill impairment test will prove to be\naccurate predictions of the future. During the three months ended June 30, 2023 the Company evaluated the events and changes\nthat could indicate that goodwill might be impaired and concluded that an interim test was not necessary.\nComprehensive income\nComprehensive income reflects the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events\nand circumstances from non-owner sources. The Company's comprehensive income represents net income adjusted for unrealized\ngains and losses on derivative instruments, net of tax. Accumulated other comprehensive loss is presented on the accompanying\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of shareholders' equity.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue from a customer consists of sales and rentals of home medical equipment and patient medical services. Patient revenues\nare billed to and collections received from Medicare, Medicaid, third-party insurers, co-insurance and patient-pay. Patient revenue\nis recognized net of contractual adjustments and bad debt based on contractual arrangements with third-party payors, an\nevaluation of expected collections resulting from the analysis of current and past due accounts, past collection experience in\nrelation to amounts billed and other relevant information. Contractual adjustments result from the differences between the rates\ncharged for services and reimbursement rates paid by government-sponsored healthcare programs and insurance companies for\nsuch services.\nThe Company's contracts with customers often include multiple products and services, and the Company evaluates these\narrangements to determine the unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes based on whether the product or service is\ndistinct from other products or services in the arrangement and should be accounted for as a separate performance obligation. A\nproduct or service is distinct if the customer can benefit from it on its own or together with other readily available resources and the\nCompany's ability to transfer the goods or services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contractual arrangement\nwith the customer (e.g. patient). Revenue is then allocated to each separately identifiable good or service based on the standalone\nprice of the items underlying the performance obligations. Most of the Company’s products fall in the Medicare Fee-for-Service\n(“FFS”) program which is a payment model where services are unbundled and paid for separately. These services are paid based\non a Medicare determined price that is publicly available on the website for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”).\nFor commercial payors, HME companies must negotiate in-network pricing separately, though in general, the Company’s payors\ntend to benchmark their contract rates and coverage policies closely to those of Medicare.\nThe Company considers performance obligations for sales and rentals to be met when the customer receives the equipment, and\nrevenue for rentals is recognized over time, over the respective rental period. For revenue associated with HME rentals, the\nCompany recognizes revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 842, “Leases,” (Topic 842). For any HME sales and services, the\nCompany recognizes revenue under FASB ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” (Topic 606) and related\namendments.\nThe Company recognizes equipment rental revenue over the non-cancelable lease term, which varies based on the type of\nequipment rental, less estimated adjustments, in accordance with Topic 842. The Company has separate contracts with each\npatient that are not subject to a master lease agreement with any third-party payor. The Company would first consider the lease\nclassification issue (sales-type lease or operating lease) and then appropriately recognize or defer rental revenue over the lease\nterm.\nPage 10\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nRevenues associated with external staffing services are accrued on an hourly basis and are recorded based on the determination\nof whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent. In arrangements in which the Company manages customers'\nsupplemental workforce needs utilizing its own network of healthcare professionals, the Company is determined to be a principal\nand includes the contractual gross billings in revenues with a corresponding increase to cost of revenues for worksite employee\npayroll costs associated with these services. Alternatively, when the Company acts as agent in the performance of workforce\nmanagement, revenue is recorded based on contractually agreed upon fees or commissions with no associated cost of revenues.\nThe revenues from each major source are summarized in the following table:\nThree Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nRevenue from rentals under Topic 842\nVentilator rentals, non-invasive and invasive $ 25,712 $ 22,736 $ 50,859 $ 44,254\nOther durable medical equipment rentals 8,419 4,912 15,325 9,271\nRevenue from sales and services under Topic 606\nEquipment and supply sales 6,778 3,245 11,542 6,282\nCOVID-19 response sales and services — 183 — 2,278\nService revenues 2,402 2,234 5,141 3,480\nTotal revenues $ 43,311 $ 33,310 $ 82,867 $ 65,565\nRevenue Accounting under Topic 842\nThe Company leases HME such as non-invasive and invasive ventilators, positive airway pressure (\"PAP\") machines, percussion\nvests, oxygen concentrator units and other small respiratory equipment to customers for a fixed monthly amount on a month-to-\nmonth basis. The customer generally has the right to cancel the lease at any time during the rental period. The Company accounts\nfor these rentals as operating leases.\nUnder FASB ASC Topic 842, the Company recognizes rental revenue on operating leases on a straight-line basis over the\ncontractual lease term which varies based on the type of equipment rental. The lease term begins on the date equipment is\ndelivered to patients, and revenues are recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with\nthird-party payors, including Medicare, private commercial payors, and Medicaid. Certain customer co-payments are included in\nrevenue when considered probable of payment, which is generally when paid.\nDue to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which the Company operates, certain estimates are\nrequired to record net revenue and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that\nthey will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. Specifically, the complexity of many third-party\nbilling arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in\nadjustments to amounts originally recorded. Such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application\nor claim denial.\nRevenue Accounting under Topic 606\nThe Company sells HME, replacement parts and supplies to customers and recognizes revenue based on contractual payment\nrates as determined by the payors at the point in time where control of the good or service is transferred through delivery to the\ncustomer. The customer and, if applicable, the payors are generally charged at the time that the product is sold. For sales of\nequipment previously placed in service, proceeds associated with these sales are recorded to gain (loss) on disposal of property\nand equipment.\nThe Company also provides sleep study services to customers and recognizes revenue when the sleep study results are complete,\nsatisfying the performance obligation. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company began offering contact and vaccine\ntracing services, which revenues are recognized in the period in which the service has been provided. The transaction price on\nequipment sales, sleep studies and contact and vaccine tracing is the amount that the Company expects to receive in exchange for\nthe goods and services provided. Due to the nature of the HME business, gross charges are retail charges and generally do not\nreflect what the Company is ultimately paid. As such, the transaction price is constrained for the difference between the gross\ncharge and what is estimated to be collected from payors and from patients. The transaction price therefore is predominantly based\non contractual payment rates as determined by the payors. The payment terms and conditions of customer contracts vary by\ncustomer type and the products and services offered.\nPage 11\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nFor staffing services, performance obligations in the staffing agreements are satisfied over time when the customer simultaneously\nreceives and consumes the benefits provided. Accordingly, revenues from staffing services are recognized on an hourly basis as\nservices are rendered by the job site employee in both principal and agent arrangements.\nThe Company determines its estimates of contractual allowances and discounts based upon contractual agreements, its policies\nand historical experience. While the rates are fixed for the product or service with the customer and the payors, such amounts\ntypically include co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles, which vary in amounts, and are due from the patient. The Company\nincludes in the transaction price only the amount that the Company expects to be entitled, which is substantially all of the payor\nbillings at contractual rates. The transaction price is initially constrained by the amount of customer co-payments, which are\nincluded in the transaction price when considered probable of payment and included in revenue if the product or service has\nalready been provided to the customer.\nDue to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which the Company operates, certain estimates are\nrequired to record net revenue and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that\nthey will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. Specifically, the complexity of many third-party\nbilling arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in\nadjustments to amounts originally recorded. Such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application\nor claim denial.\nReturns and refunds are not accepted on equipment sales, sleep study services, staffing services, or contact and vaccine tracing\nservices. The Company does not offer warranties to customers in excess of the manufacturer’s warranty. Any taxes due upon sale\nof the products or services are not recognized as revenue. The Company does not have any partially or unfilled performance\nobligations related to contracts with customers and as such, the Company has no contract liabilities as of June 30, 2023.\nStock-based compensation\nThe Company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, \"Compensation—Stock Compensation\",\nwhich establishes accounting for share-based awards exchanged for employee services and requires companies to expense the\nestimated fair value of these awards over the requisite employee service period. Stock–based compensation costs for stock\noptions are determined at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Stock-based compensation costs for\nrestricted stock units (\"RSUs\") are determined at the grant date based on the closing stock price. The expense of such stock-based\ncompensation awards is recognized using the graded vesting attribution method over the vesting period and the offsetting credit is\nrecorded as an increase in additional paid-in capital. Forfeitures are recorded as incurred. Any excess tax benefit or deficiency is\nrecognized as a component of income taxes and within operating cash flows upon vesting of the share-based award.\nFor the Company’s phantom share units settled in cash, the Company computes the fair value of the phantom share units using the\nclosing price of the Company's stock at the end of each period and records a liability based on the percentage of requisite service.\nInterest rate swaps\nThe Company utilized an interest rate swap contract to reduce exposure to fluctuations in variable interest rates for future interest\npayments on the 2019 Term Note (as defined below).\nFor determining the fair value of the interest rate swap contract, the Company uses significant other observable market data or\nassumptions (Level 2 inputs) that market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities, including assumptions about\ncounterparty risk. These fair value estimates reflect an income approach based on the terms of the interest rate swap contract and\ninputs corroborated by observable market data including interest rate curves. The Company presents a positive ending period fair\nvalue of the interest rate swap contract in other long-term assets, as a component of long-term assets, and a negative ending\nperiod fair value of the interest rate swap contract in accrued liabilities, as a component of long-term liabilities on the Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company recognized any differences between the variable interest rate payments and the fixed interest rate settlements from\nits swap counterparty as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swap. If determined to be an effective cash flow\nhedge, the Company will record the changes in the estimated fair value of the swaps to accumulated other comprehensive income\nor loss on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. To the extent that interest rate swaps are determined to be ineffective, the\nCompany would recognize the changes in the estimated fair value of swaps in interest and other non-operating expenses, net in its\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Income.\nPage 12\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company settled its interest rate swap in connection with the refinancing of its\ncredit facilities and recognized the realized gain of $0.2 million in Other Income.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in numerous U.S. jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the\nprovision for income taxes. The Company's income tax provisions reflect management’s interpretation of country and state tax\nlaws. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course\nof business and may remain uncertain for several years after their occurrence. The Company recognizes assets and liabilities for\ntaxation when it is probable that the Company will receive refunds from or pay taxes to the relevant tax authority. Where the final\ndetermination of tax assets and liabilities is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the\ncurrent and deferred income taxes provision in the period in which such a determination is made. Changes in tax law or changes in\nthe way tax law is interpreted may also impact the Company's effective tax rate as well as the Company's business and operations.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future income tax consequences attributable to temporary\ndifferences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases. Deferred\nincome tax assets or liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in\nwhich those temporary differences are expected to be settled. The calculation of current and deferred income taxes requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions and to exercise a certain amount of judgment concerning the carrying value of\nassets and liabilities. The current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are also impacted by expectations about future\noperating results and the timing of reversal of temporary differences as well as possible audits of tax filings by regulatory agencies.\nChanges or differences in these estimates or assumptions may result in changes to the current and deferred tax assets and\nliabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and a charge to or recovery of income tax expense.\nCARES Act Funds Received\nThe Company received a general distribution payment from the Provider Relief Fund of $3.5 million in April 2020, a targeted\ndistribution payment of $1.5 million in November 2021, and a general distribution payment of $0.4 million in January 2022. The\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") has stated that Provider Relief Fund payments are not loans and will not\nneed to be repaid. However, as a condition to the receipt of funds, the Company and any other providers must agree to a detailed\nset of terms and conditions. CMS has indicated that the terms and conditions may be subject to ongoing changes and reporting.\nThere is no US GAAP guidance for for-profit health care entities that receive government grants that are not in the form of an\nincome tax credit, revenue from a contract with a customer or a loan. As such, for-profit entities must determine the appropriate\naccounting treatment by analogy to other guidance such as International Accounting Standards (IAS) 20, Accounting for\nGovernment Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance, in International Financial Reporting Standards. Under IAS 20, the\nCompany determined that upon receipt of funds, it fully complied with the conditions attached to the grant. The Company\nrecognized the distributions received from the Provider Relief Fund in the income statement in full during the period of receipt. To\nthe extent that reporting requirements and terms and conditions are modified, it may affect the Company's ability to comply and\nmay require the return of funds. The Company is not aware of any such modifications as of June 30, 2023\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nOn January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on\nFinancial Instruments. The standard replaces the current incurred loss impairment model that recognizes losses when a probable\nthreshold is met with a requirement to recognize lifetime expected credit losses immediately when a financial asset is originated or\npurchased. Further, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04 and ASU 2019-05 to provide additional guidance on the credit losses standard.\nWhile the adoption of ASC 326 could result in a higher allowance recorded in the future for credit losses on receivables within the\nscope of the standard due to the prescribed measurement principles, the impact of the adoption on the Company's consolidated\nfinancials statements was not material.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company” as defined by the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth\ncompany can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can selectively\ndelay the adoption of all accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company\nhas elected to utilize this exemption and, as a result, the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements may not be\ncomparable to the financial statements of issuers that are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting\nstandards that are applicable to public companies. To date, however, the Company has not delayed the adoption of any accounting\nPage 13\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nstandards except as noted below. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that the Company can elect to opt out of the extended\ntransition period at any time, which election is irrevocable.\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, Liabilities — Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of\nSupplier Finance Program Obligations, which requires entities that use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase\nof goods and services to disclose the key terms of the programs and information about their obligations that are outstanding at the\nend of the reporting period. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022,\nincluding interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company does not expect the update to affect the recognition, measurement, or\nfinancial statement presentation of supplier finance program obligations, but is evaluating the impact of the update on related\ndisclosures upon adoption.\nPage 14\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\n3. Business Combinations\nOn June 1, 2023, Viemed, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the acquisition of Home Medical Products,\nInc., (“HMP”), which operates in Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi. The Company acquired 100% of the equity ownership of\nHMP in exchange for approximately $29.4 million in cash or cash payable, subject to customary post-closing net working capital\nand other adjustments. Approximately $15 million of the purchase consideration was funded by cash on hand, $8 million was\nfunded by a borrowing on the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, and $5 million was funded by a borrowing on the 2022 Term Loan\nFacility.\nThe results of HMP’s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. The\nCompany expensed $254,000 of acquisition costs in conjunction with the acquisition for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\nThese costs include system conversion and integrating operations charges, as well as legal and consulting expenses, and are\nincluded in selling, general, and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and\ncomprehensive income.\nThe following table summarizes the consideration paid and estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at\nthe acquisition date. The Company is in the process of obtaining third-party valuations of certain fixed assets and identifiable\nintangible assets; thus, the provisional measurements of property plant and equipment, trade names, non-compete agreements,\nand goodwill are subject to change. The fair value of accounts receivables acquired is $2.0 million, with the gross contractual\namount being $2.9 million.

Debt\n2018 Senior Credit Facility\nOn February 20, 2018, the Company entered a Commercial Business Loan Agreement (the \"2018 Senior Credit Facility\") that\nprovided for Term Loans and Lines of Credit with Hancock Whitney Bank. Until November 29, 2022, the Company maintained a\nline of credit in the amount of $10.0 million under the 2018 Senior Credit Facility. On May 30, 2019, the Company entered into a\nterm note (“Building Term Note”) under the 2018 Senior Credit Facility in the principal amount of $4.8 million. The proceeds of the\nBuilding Term Note were used to purchase the Company's corporate headquarters. In connection with the Building Term Note, the\nCompany entered into an interest rate swap transaction (\"Interest Rate Swap Transaction\") with Hancock Whitney Bank effectively\nfixing the interest rate for the Building Term Note at 4.68%. On September 19, 2019, the Company entered into an additional loan\nagreement providing for a term note (the “2019 Term Note\") under the 2018 Senior Credit Facility in the principal amount of $5.0\nmillion and bearing an annual interest rate of 4.60%. The proceeds of the 2019 Term Note were utilized for general corporate\npurposes. The 2019 Term Note matured on September 19, 2022 at which time the entire unpaid balance of principal and interest\nwas repaid in full. In connection with the entry in to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities on November 29, 2022, the Company retired\nthe 2018 Senior Credit Facility, and repaid all outstanding interest and principal in full.\n2022 Senior Credit Facilities\nOn November 29, 2022, the Company refinanced its existing borrowings under the 2018 Senior Credit Facility and entered into a\nnew credit agreement (the \"2022 Senior Credit Facilities\") with the lenders from time to time party thereto, and Regions Bank, as\nadministrative agent (the \"Administrative Agent\") and collateral agent, that provides for an up to $30.0 million revolving credit facility\n(the \"2022 Revolving Credit Facility\") and an up to $30.0 million delayed draw term loan facility (the \"2022 Term Loan Facility\"),\nboth maturing in November 2027.\nThe proceeds of the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility may be used to refinance existing indebtedness, for working capital purposes,\ncapital expenditures and other general corporate purposes (including permitted acquisitions), and to pay transaction fees, costs\nand expenses related to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities. The proceeds of the 2022 Term Loan Facility and any additional term\nloans established in accordance with the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities may be used to finance permitted acquisitions and to pay\ntransaction fees, costs and expenses related to such acquisitions.\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are Term SOFR (as defined in the 2022 Senior Credit\nFacilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 2.625% to 3.375%, or, at the option of the Company, a Base Rate (as\ndefined in the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 1.625% to 2.375%.\nThe 2022 Senior Credit Facilities require the Company to comply with certain affirmative, as well as certain negative covenants\nthat, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make\ninvestments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations and pay dividends and other restricted payments. The 2022 Senior\nCredit Facilities also include certain financial covenants, which generally include, but are not limited to the following:\n• Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (defined generally as total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than (i) for\nany fiscal quarter ending during the period from the closing date to and including December 31, 2024, 2.75 to 1.0 and (ii)\nfor any fiscal quarter ending on and after March 31, 2025, 2.50 to 1.0, subject to certain adjustments following a material\nacquisition.\n• Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (defined generally as (a) adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditures minus\ncash taxes to (b) the sum of scheduled principal payments plus cash interest expense plus restricted payments) of not\nless than 1.25:1.0.\nThe Company was in compliance with all covenants under the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities in effect at June 30, 2023.\nPage 17\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nThe 2022 Senior Credit Facilities includes provisions permitting the Company from time to time to, subject to certain terms and\nconditions, increase the aggregate amount of commitments under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility and/or establish one or more\nadditional term loans under the 2022 Term Loan Facility, in each case, with additional commitments from existing lenders or new\ncommitments from financial institutions acceptable to the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion; provided, that, (a) the\naggregate principal amount of any increases in the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, and (b) the aggregate principal amount of all\nadditional term loans under the 2022 Term Loan Facility established after the closing date will not exceed $30.0 million.\nFinancing costs and commitment fees related to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are capitalized and amortized over the term of the\nloans using the effective interest method.\nThe recorded balances associated with the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are as follows:\nJune 30, 2023 December 31, 2022\nOutstanding balance $ 13,000 $ —\nFinancing costs and commitment fees (748) —\nLess:\nCurrent portion of notes payable (250) —\nNet long-term notes payable $ 12,002 $ —\nMedical Equipment Financing\nAs a result of the acquisition of HMP, the Company assumed equipment financing obligations consisting of installment payments\nfor medical equipment which secure the financing. The financing obligations are payable in monthly installments through 2026 and\ninclude interest at rates ranging from 0% to 7.99%. As of June 30, 2023, $3 million of the outstanding medical equipment financing\nobligations is presented on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as short term debt and $0.1 million is presented as long\nterm debt, based on the scheduled repayment dates.\n7. Fair Value Measurement\nUnder ASC Topic 820, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (i.e., an exit price). ASC Topic 820 establishes a\nhierarchy for inputs to valuation techniques used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and\nminimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. There are three\nlevels to the hierarchy based on the reliability of inputs, as follows:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or\nsimilar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value\nis greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3.\nPage 18\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe Company measures certain assets at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no transfers between fair value measurement\nlevels during any presented period.\nThe following tables summarize the Company's assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022:\nAt June 30, 2023\n(In thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements:\nMoney market mutual funds $ 2,078 $ — $ — $ 2,078\nAvailable for sale debt instrument — — 2,110 2,110\nTotal $ 2,078 $ — $ 2,110 $ 4,188\nAt December 31, 2022\n(In thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements:\nMoney market mutual funds $ 11,005 $ — $ — $ 11,005\nAvailable for sale debt instrument $ — $ — $ 2,000 $ 2,000\nTotal $ 11,005 $ — $ 2,000 $ 13,005\nAvailable for Sale Debt Instrument\nThe fair value of the Company’s available for sale debt instrument approximates its amortized cost basis due to the short maturity\nand indexed interest rate terms. The fair value is classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the Company evaluates\nadjustments using a combination of observable and unobservable inputs, such as operating results of the counterparty as well\nobservable prices in transactions of debt and equity instruments of the issuing counterparty when available. As of June 30, 2023,\nthe analysis resulted in no adjustments to the carrying value impacting unrealized gains or losses. All changes to measured fair\nvalue during the period were the result of accrued interest.\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nThe Company measures certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets include equity method investments and\nother equity investments. Equity method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying value of the investments may exceed the fair value. The Company's other equity investments are holdings\nin privately-held companies without a readily determinable market value. The Company remeasures equity securities without\nreadily determinable fair value at fair value when an orderly transaction is identified for an identical or similar investment of the\nsame issuer in accordance with the measurement alternative under Topic 820. ASU 2019-04 states that the measurement\nalternative is a nonrecurring fair value measurement. Accordingly, other equity investments without readily determinable fair value\nare classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because the Company estimates the value using a combination of\nobservable and unobservable inputs, including valuation ascribed to the issuing company in subsequent financing rounds, volatility\nin the results of operations of the issuers and rights and obligations of the holdings the Company owns.\nThe Company had no material adjustments of assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during any of the periods\npresented. There were no transfers between fair value measurement levels during any presented period.\nPage 19\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\n8. Shareholders' Equity\nAuthorized share capital\nThe Company’s authorized share capital consists of an unlimited number of common shares, with no stated par value.\nIssued and outstanding share capital\nThe Company has only one class of stock outstanding, common shares. The authorized stock consists of an unlimited number of\ncommon shares with no stated par value, of which 38,400,422 and 38,049,739 shares were issued and outstanding as of June 30,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company acquired and cancelled 66,734 common shares at a cost of $0.5 million to\nsatisfy employee income tax withholding associated with RSUs vesting. The Company’s retained earnings were reduced by the\namount paid for the shares repurchased and cancelled.\nStock-based compensation\nEffective June 11, 2020 (the \"Effective Date\"), the Company’s shareholders approved the Company's 2020 Long Term Incentive\nPlan (the \"Omnibus Plan\"). Upon approval of the Omnibus Plan, no future awards are available to be made under the Company's\nprevious RSU and Option Plans (collectively, the \"Former Plan\"), and the common shares that were not settled or awarded under\nthe Former Plan as of the Effective Date are available for awards under the Omnibus Plan. The maximum number of common\nshares that are available for awards under the Omnibus Plan and under any other security-based compensation arrangements\nadopted by the Company, including the Former Plan, may not exceed 7,758,211 shares (equal to 20% of the issued and\noutstanding common shares of the Company on the Effective Date). The maximum amount of the foregoing common shares that\nmay be awarded under the Omnibus Plan as “incentive stock options” is 2,600,000 common shares. As of June 30, 2023, the\nCompany had outstanding options of 4,244,000 and RSUs of 1,123,000 associated with common shares under the Omnibus Plan.\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\n(in thousands):\nThree Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nStock-based compensation - options $ 301 $ 757 $ 649 $ 1,577\nStock-based compensation - restricted stock units 1,170 514 2,213 999\nTotal $ 1,471 $ 1,271 $ 2,862 $ 2,576\nAt June 30, 2023, there was approximately $889,000 of total unrecognized pre-tax stock option expense under the Company's\nequity compensation plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.32 years. As of June 30, 2023,\nthere was approximately $4,780,000 of total unrecognized pre-tax compensation expense related to outstanding time-based\nrestricted stock units that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.26 years.\nPage 20\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nOptions\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the six months ended June 30, 2023:\nNumber of Weighted average\noptions Weighted average remaining Aggregate\n(000's) exercise price(1) contractual life intrinsic value(2)\nBalance December 31, 2022 4,497 $ 5.26 6.9 years $ 11,356\nIssued — —\nExercised (228) 5.51\nExpired / Forfeited (25) 6.47\nBalance June 30, 2023 4,244 $ 5.24 6.4 years $ 19,290\n(1)For presentation purposes, stock options issued with a Canadian dollar exercise price have been translated to U.S. dollars based on the\nprevailing exchange rate on the date of grant.\n(2)The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding represents the difference between the exercise price of the option and the closing share price\nof the Company's common stock on the last trading day of the period ($9.78).\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding was $19,290,197 and options exercisable were $16,579,787 at June 30, 2023.\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2023, 228,000 common shares were issued pursuant to the exercise of stock options.\nAt June 30, 2023, the Company had 3,415,000 exercisable stock options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of\n$4.93 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 6.0 years. At December 31, 2022, the Company had 2,841,000\nexercisable stock options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $4.53 and a weighted average remaining\ncontractual life of 6.1 years.\nThe fair value of the stock options has been charged to the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income and\ncredited to additional paid-in capital over the vesting period, using the grant date fair value based on the Black-Scholes option\npricing model. The assumptions used to determine the grant date fair value of stock options include exercise price, risk-free interest\nrates, expected volatility, and average life of an option. The risk-free interest rates are based on the rates available at the time of\nthe grant for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the option’s expected life. The average life of an\noption is based on both historical and projected exercise and lapsing data. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from\ntraded options on the Company's common shares and historical volatility of the Company's common shares over the expected life\nof the option. There were no issuances of options during the six months ended June 30, 2023.\nRestricted stock units\nThe Company accounts for RSUs using fair value. The fair value of the RSUs has been charged to the Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Income and Comprehensive Income and credited to additional paid-in capital over the vesting period, based on the\nstock price on the date of grant. RSUs vest generally over a one or three-year period. The Company accounts for forfeitures on\nRSUs under ASU 2016-09 and recognizes forfeitures in the period in which they occur.\nThe following table summarizes RSU activity for the six months ended June 30, 2023:\nWeighted\nWeighted average Aggregate\nNumber of average grant remaining intrinsic\nRSUs (000's) price contractual life value(1)\nBalance December 31, 2022 629 $ 5.62 0.88 years $ 4,755\nIssued 702 7.87\nVested (190) 5.56\nExpired / Forfeited (18) 6.70\nBalance June 30, 2023 1,123 $ 7.02 1.26 years $ 10,986\n(1)The aggregate intrinsic value of time-based RSUs outstanding was based on the Company's closing stock price on the last trading day of the\nperiod ($9.78).\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company issued 702,206 RSUs with a vesting term of three years and a fair value\nof $5.6 million.

Phantom share units\ngranted under the plan are non-assignable and are settled in cash at vesting based on the fair value of the Company's common\nstock on the vesting date. Phantom share units vest annually over a three-year period. The cash-settled phantom share units are\naccounted for as liability awards and are re-measured at fair value each reporting period until they become vested with accrued\nliability and related expense being recognized over the requisite service period.\nThe following table summarizes phantom share unit activity for the six months ended June 30, 2023:\nNumber of phantom Value of share\nshare units (000's) equivalents(1)\nBalance December 31, 2022 513 $ 3,878\nIssued 176 1,401\nVested (239) (578)\nExpired / Forfeited (20) (196)\nBalance June 30, 2023 430 $ 4,200\n(1)The value of outstanding share equivalents at the beginning of the period is based on the market price of the Company’s stock at that time, the\nvalue of issued share equivalents is based on the market price of the Company’s stock at issuance, the value of vested share equivalents is based\non the cash paid at the time of vesting, and the values of expired/forfeited share equivalents and outstanding share equivalents at the end of the\nperiod are based on the market price of the Company's stock at the end of the period. The market price of the Company's stock was $9.78 on June\n30, 2023.\nThe change in fair value of the phantom share units has been charged to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and\nComprehensive Income and recorded as a liability included in accrued liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities. The total liability\nassociated with phantom share units at June 30, 2023 is $2,120,000, with $1,483,000 of this amount included in current accrued\nliabilities and the remaining portion of $637,000 included in long-term accrued liabilities.\nThe impact associated with the fair value re-measurement of phantom share units is recorded in selling, general and administrative\nexpenses within the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.

Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company accrues estimates for resolution of any legal and other contingencies when losses are probable and reasonably\nestimable in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies (“ASC 450”). No less than quarterly, the Company reviews the status of\neach significant matter underlying a legal proceeding or claim and assess our potential financial exposure. The Company accrues a\nliability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any legal proceeding or claim is considered probable and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether\nthe amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable, and accruals are based only on the information available to the Company at\nthe time the judgment is made, which may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate or unanticipated events and circumstances may\noccur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, the outcome of legal proceedings is\ninherently uncertain, and we may incur substantial defense costs and expenses defending any of these matters.\nLegal Proceedings\nAs previously disclosed, the Company (through its subsidiary Sleep Management LLC) submitted a purchase order (the “Purchase\nOrder”) in March 2020 to Vyaire Medical, Inc. d/b/a CareFusion Respiratory Technologies (“Vyaire”) for respiratory equipment. The\nCompany ultimately prepaid $1.4 million towards the delivery of such respiratory equipment. Vyaire was unable or unwilling to\ndeliver the vast majority of the respiratory equipment referenced in the Purchase Order, and also refused to refund the prepayment\namount (less the amounts paid for equipment actually received). On July 29, 2020, the Company (through its subsidiary Sleep\nManagement LLC) filed a lawsuit against Vyaire in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana (the\n“Court”). This lawsuit was dismissed on December 8, 2020 in connection with the commencement of the lawsuit filed by the\nCompany (through its subsidiary Sleep Management) on November 5, 2020, against Vyaire in the 15th Judicial District Court for\nthe Parish of Lafayette, Louisiana (the “State Court”) seeking damages for breach of contract and seeking a declaratory judgment\nthat the Company is not required to pay any further funds to Vyaire. On December 28, 2020, Vyaire filed its Answer, Affirmative\nDefenses, and Reconventional Demand (“Reconventional Demand”) with the State Court alleging breach of contract and seeking\ndamages of $4.7 million, purportedly for the improper cancellation of the Purchase Order. The Company filed its Answer to the\nReconventional Demand on February 12, 2021 and the parties completed discovery on July 17, 2023. The Company filed a Motion\nfor Summary Judgment on June 9, 2023. The Court has set an August 28, 2023 hearing on that motion and has set a date for a\nnon-jury trial on October 30, 2023.\nThe Company continues to believe that it has valid legal and equitable grounds to recover its outstanding prepayment as a result of\nVyaire’s failure to deliver the vast majority of the respiratory equipment referenced in the Purchase Order. The Company has\ndetermined that a loss related to the Reconventional Demand is not probable, and thus has not accrued a liability related to this\nclaim. Although a loss may be reasonably possible, the Company does not have sufficient information to determine the amount or\nrange of reasonably possible loss with respect to the Reconventional Demand given that the dispute is in the early stages of the\nlegal process. As of June 30, 2023, outstanding funds in the amount of $0.9 million related to undelivered respiratory equipment\nare included within other long-term assets.\nPage 23\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nGovernmental and Regulatory Matters\nFrom time to time the Company is involved in various external governmental investigations, audits and reviews. Reviews, audits\nand investigations of this sort can lead to government actions, which can result in the assessment of recoupment of\nreimbursement, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way the Company\nconducts business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs.\nIn May of 2021, a final report and recommendation (“Report”) was issued by the OIG regarding an audit by OIG of claims relating to\n100 of the Company’s non-invasive ventilation at home (“NIVH”) patients. The OIG asserted that most of the sampled Medicare\nclaims submitted for the monthly rental of non-invasive ventilators did not comply with Medicare requirements. The Company firmly\nbelieved that the Report ignored each patient’s diagnosis and supporting documentation of that diagnosis from treating and\nprescribing physicians and applied clinical guidelines that were contrary to CMS’s accepted standard of care. In late June of 2021,\nthe Company received initial request letters from DME Medicare Administrative Contractors (\"MACs\") referencing the Report and\nrequesting repayment of purported overpayments. The Company responded to each initial request by submitting a rebuttal and by\nfiling a redetermination appeal as prescribed by the initial request letters and by statute. In September 2021, the MACs informed\nthe Company of unfavorable decisions with respect to the redetermination appeals. In November 2021, the Company filed\nReconsideration Appeals with CMS's designated Qualified Independent Contractor (\"QIC\"). Based on its review, the QIC\ndetermined that approximately 77% of the claims it reviewed were medically necessary and properly payable under Medicare rules\nand regulations, overturning OIG’s and the MACs' initial recommendations and determinations. As a result of the QIC's\nreconsideration findings, reduced and recalculated principal overpayment requests totaling $1.1 million were issued by the MACs.\nIn order to limit the assessment of interest during the appeals period, the Company remitted the associated funds to the MACs. In\nDecember 2022, an Administrative Law Judge overturned all of the remaining appealed claims and instructed the MACs to refund\nall funds previously remitted by the Company. Accordingly, the funds remitted to the MACs are recorded in Prepaid expenses and\nother assets at December 31, 2022 and were received during the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n10. Income Taxes\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded income tax expense of $1.2 million, which includes a discrete tax\nbenefit of $0.1 million associated with stock-based compensation arrangements. Excluding the impact of the discrete taxes, the\neffective rate for the six months ended June 30, 2023 is 28.6%. The effective rate differs from the amount computed by applying\nthe statutory federal and state income tax rates to ordinary income before the provision for income taxes due to permanent non-\ndeductible differences. The Company's effective tax rate is based on forecasted annual results which may fluctuate significantly\nthrough the rest of the year.\nAt June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no amounts recorded for uncertain tax positions and does not expect any material\nchanges in uncertain tax benefits during the next 12 months. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax\nmatters in income tax expense. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in various states. The\nCompany is generally not subject to examination by taxing authorities for years prior to 2019.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that the Company believes that these assets are more likely than not to\nbe realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future\nreversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent\noperations.\n11. Earnings Per Share\nIncome per common share is calculated using earnings for the year divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding\nduring the year. Using the treasury stock method, diluted income per share amounts are calculated giving effect to the potential\ndilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to issue common shares were exercised or converted to common shares by\nassuming the proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs are used to purchase common shares\nat the prevailing market rate.\nPage 24\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nThe following reflects the earnings and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:\nThree Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nNumerator - basic and diluted:\nNet income attributable to shareholders $ 2,330 $ 967 $ 3,847 $ 2,729\nDenominator:\nBasic weighted-average number of common shares 38,324,249 38,773,580 38,240,902 39,195,317\nDiluted weighted-average number of shares 40,676,951 39,752,928 40,383,616 40,056,953\nBasic earnings per share $ 0.06 $ 0.02 $ 0.10 $ 0.07\nDiluted earnings per share $ 0.06 $ 0.02 $ 0.10 $ 0.07\nDenominator calculation from basic to diluted:\nBasic weighted-average number of common shares 38,324,249 38,773,580 38,240,902 39,195,317\nStock options and other dilutive securities 2,352,702 979,348 2,142,714 861,636\nDiluted weighted-average number of shares 40,676,951 39,752,928 40,383,616 40,056,953\nAnti-dilutive shares excluded from the calculation consisted of dilutive employee stock options and RSUs that were de minimis in all\nperiods presented.\nPage 25\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nItem 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with, and is\nqualified entirely by, our condensed consolidated financial statements (including Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements) and the other consolidated financial information under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Some of the\ninformation in this discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Actual results\nand timing of events could differ from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the\nfollowing discussion and analysis.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements and information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the\nmeaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or \"forward-looking information\" as such term is defined in\napplicable Canadian securities legislation (collectively, \"forward-looking statements\"). Any statements other than statements of\nhistorical information, including those that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives,\nassumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking and may involve estimates,\nassumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-\nlooking statements. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly\nupdate or revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events\nor otherwise, except as required by applicable law.\nForward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance and reflect the expectations or beliefs of management\nregarding future events, and include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: operating results; profitability; financial\ncondition and resources; anticipated needs for working capital; liquidity; capital resources; capital expenditures; milestones;\nlicensing milestones; information with respect to future growth and growth strategies; anticipated trends in our industry; our future\nfinancing plans; timelines; currency fluctuations; government regulation; unanticipated expenses; commercial disputes or claims;\nlimitations on insurance coverage or other reimbursement; and availability of cash flow to fund capital requirements.\nOften, but not always, forward-looking information can be identified by the use of words such as “plans”, “expects”, “is expected”,\n“budget”, “potential”, “scheduled”, “estimates”, “forecasts”, “intends”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “projects”, or the negatives thereof or\nvariations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results “will”, “should”, “may”, “could”, “would”,\n“might” or “will be taken”, “occur” or “be achieved” or the negative of these terms or comparable terminology.\nForward-looking statements are based on the reasonable assumptions, estimates, analysis and opinions of management made in\nlight of its experience and its perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments, as well as other factors that\nmanagement believes to be relevant and reasonable in the circumstances at the date that such statements are made, but which\nmay prove to be incorrect. We believe that the assumptions and expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are\nreasonable. We cannot assure you, however, that such statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events\ncould differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-\nlooking statements.\nPage 26\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nBy their nature, forward-looking statements involve numerous assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and\nspecific, including those identified under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the other\ndocuments we file with the SEC, including under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, and with the securities regulatory authorities in certain provinces of Canada, which contribute to the possibility\nthat the predicted outcomes may not occur or may be delayed. The risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are\nbeyond our control, that could influence actual results include, but are not limited to: the general business, market and economic\nconditions in the regions in which the we operate; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by governmental\nauthorities, individuals and companies in response to the pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations,\nincluding on our patient base, revenues, employees, and equipment and supplies; significant capital requirements and operating\nrisks that we may be subject to; our ability to implement business strategies and pursue business opportunities; volatility in the\nmarket price of our common shares; our novel business model; the state of the capital markets; the availability of funds and\nresources to pursue operations; reductions in reimbursement rates and audits of reimbursement claims by various governmental\nand private payor entities; dependence on few payors; possible new drug discoveries; dependence on key suppliers; granting of\npermits and licenses in a highly regulated business; competition; disruptions in or attacks (including cyber-attacks) on our\ninformation technology, internet, network access or other voice or data communications systems or services; the evolution of\nvarious types of fraud or other criminal behavior to which we are exposed; difficulty integrating newly acquired businesses; the\nimpact of new and changes to, or application of, current laws and regulations; the overall difficult litigation and regulatory\nenvironment; increased competition; increased funding costs and market volatility due to market illiquidity and competition for\nfunding; critical accounting estimates and changes to accounting standards, policies, and methods used by us; our status as an\nemerging growth company and a smaller reporting company; and the occurrence of natural and unnatural catastrophic events or\nhealth epidemics or concerns, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and claims resulting from such events or concerns, as well as\nother general economic, market and business conditions; and other factors beyond our control.\nGeneral Matters\nIn this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" and \"our\" refer\nto Viemed Healthcare, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nWe were incorporated on December 14, 2016 pursuant to the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). As of June 30, 2020,\nwe determined that we no longer qualify as a \"foreign private issuer,\" as defined in Rule 3b-4 of the Exchange Act, for the purposes\nof the informational requirements of the Exchange Act. As a result, effective January 1, 2021, we became subject to the proxy\nsolicitation rules under Section 14 of the Exchange Act and Regulation FD, and our officers, directors, and principal shareholders\nbecame subject to the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. We will\ncontinue to file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K with the SEC and\nwith the relevant Canadian securities regulatory authorities on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval\n(SEDAR).\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the JOBS Act and a \"smaller reporting company\" under Rule 12b-2 of the\nExchange Act, and as such, we have elected to comply with certain reduced U.S. public company reporting requirements.\nUnless otherwise noted herein, all references to \"$\" or \"USD\" are to the currency of the United States and references to \"CAD$\" or\n\"Canadian dollars\" are to the currency of Canada.\nOverview\nWe provide an array of home medical equipment, services and supplies, specializing in post-acute respiratory care services in the\nUnited States. Our primary objective is to focus on the organic growth of the business and thereby solidify our position as one of\nthe United States’ largest providers of in-home therapy for patients suffering from respiratory diseases. Our respiratory care\nprograms are designed specifically for payors to have the ability to treat patients in the home for less total cost and with a superior\nquality of care. Our services include respiratory disease management (through the rental of various HME devices), neuromuscular\ncare, in-home sleep testing and sleep apnea treatment, oxygen therapy, and the sale of associated supplies.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue through the rental of non-invasive and invasive ventilators which represented 59.4% and\n68.6% of our traditional revenue, excluding COVID-19 response sales and services, for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and\n2022, respectively, and 61.4% and 69.9% for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We combine the benefits\nof home ventilation support with licensed Respiratory Therapists (\"RTs\") to drive improved patient outcomes and reduce costly\nhospital readmissions.\nPage 27\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nWe expect to grow through expansion of existing service areas as well as in new territories through a cost efficient launch that\nreduces location expenses. We currently serve patients in all 50 states. We expect to continue to employ more RTs in order to\nassure our high service model is accomplished in the home. As of June 30, 2023, we employed 330 licensed RTs, representing\napproximately 34% of our company-wide employee count. By focusing overhead costs on personnel that service the patient rather\nthan physical location costs, we anticipate that we will efficiently scale our business in regions that are currently not being\neffectively serviced.\nThe continued trend of servicing patients in the home rather than in hospitals is aligned with our business objective and we\nanticipate that this trend will continue to offer growth opportunities for us. We expect to continue to be a solution to the rising health\ncosts in the United States by offering more cost effective, home based solutions while increasing the quality of life for patients\nfighting serious respiratory diseases.\nTrends Affecting our Business\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Various policies and initiatives\nwere implemented to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, the postponement of non-\nessential medical surgeries, limiting access to medical facilities, and adoption of social distancing and remote working policies.\nEmployee and patient safety is our first priority, and as a result, we put preparedness plans in place for our employees, especially\nour clinical personnel, and modified our clinical protocols to limit unnecessary patient encounters. On May 11, 2023, the COVID-19\nPublic Health Emergency declared by the Secretary of HHS under Public Health Service Act section 319 (\"COVID-19 PHE\") ended.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has announced in the Federal Register that the Emergency Use Authorization for certain\nventilators and PAP and RAD devices will be in effect until November 7, 2023, 180 days beyond the end of the COVID-19 PHE. At\nthe end of the COVID-19 PHE, many waivers and flexibilities available during the COVID-19 pandemic will become unavailable.\nWhile COVID-19 related measures have not had a material impact on our consolidated operating results for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2023, we cannot predict at this time the impact that the end of the COVID-19 PHE will have on our business and financial\ncondition. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that demand for our products and services will continue or that we will be able to\nmaintain operations necessary to satisfy such demand, including sufficient personnel, supply chains and distributions channels.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant disruptions and volatility in capital and financial markets. Broad economic factors\nresulting from the current COVID-19 pandemic, including high unemployment and underemployment levels and reduced consumer\nspending and confidence, could also affect our service mix, revenue mix, payor mix and patient base, as well as our ability to\ncollect outstanding receivables. Business closures and layoffs in the geographic areas in which we operate may lead to increases\nin the uninsured and under-insured populations and adversely affect demand for our services, as well as the ability of patients and\nother payors to pay for services rendered. Any increase in the amount or deterioration in the collectability of patient accounts\nreceivable will adversely affect our financial results and require an increased level of working capital. In addition, we may\nexperience supply chain disruptions, including delays and price increases in equipment and supplies. Staffing, equipment and\nsupplies shortages may also impact our ability to assess potential patients in hospitals and set up and treat patients in the home. If\nCOVID-19 intensifies or if the response to contain the COVID-19 pandemic is unsuccessful, we could experience a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For additional information, see Part II - Item 1A. “Risk\nFactors.”\nThe CARES Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, provides a substantial stimulus and assistance package intended\nto address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including tax relief and government loans, grants and investments. We are\ncontinuing to monitor any effects or requirements that may result from the CARES Act as many of the provisions in the CARES Act\nare temporary and may require us to modify our operations and compliance procedures. CMS and other federal agencies have and\nare likely to issue rules and regulations to implement the CARES Act. The impact of these rules and regulations are unknown and\nmay affect us. To the extent these provisions will expire as stated in the CARES Act, we will be required to unwind any changes.\nIn 2019, CMS announced the inclusion of non-invasive ventilator products on the list of products subject to the competitive bidding\nprogram in Round 2021 which covers the period of January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2023. On March 9, 2020, CMS\nannounced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States President’s exercise of the Defense Production Act, public\nconcern regarding access to ventilators, and the non-invasive ventilators product category being new to the competitive bidding\nprogram, non-invasive ventilators were removed as a product category from Round 2021. On October 27, 2020, CMS announced\nthat it had removed 13 of the 15 remaining product categories from Round 2021, including oxygen and PAP devices, because the\npayment amounts did not achieve expected savings. As a result of these announcements, we retain the ability to continue to\nfurnish non-invasive ventilators and oxygen and PAP devices for all of our Medicare accredited areas, however, we are uncertain if\nnon-invasive ventilators, oxygen, and PAP devices will be included in future competitive bidding programs. The current Round 2021\nPage 28\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\ncontracts expire on December 31, 2023 and CMS has not announced a new round of competitive bidding. Historically, CMS\nannounces new rounds of competitive bidding and starts the process approximately 18 months prior to the contract start date.\nThe CARES Act introduced a new blended rate for HME furnished in non-rural or contiguous non-competitive bidding areas that is\nbased on 75% of the adjusted fee schedule amount and 25% of the unadjusted fee schedule amount. The Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, 2023 further extended the 75/25 blended Medicare reimbursement rate in non-competitive bidding/non-rural\nareas through the end of the COVID-19 PHE or December 31, 2023, whichever is later, after which it will revert to 100% of the\nMedicare fee schedule.\nThe CARES Act also provided for a temporary suspension of the 2% payment sequestration adjustment currently applied to all\nMedicare fee-for-service claims. In December 2021, President Biden signed into law legislation that extended the suspension on\nthe 2 percent payment sequestration through March 31, 2022. The payment sequestration adjustment was fixed at 1 percent from\nApril 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022 and it returned to 2 percent on July 1, 2022.\nThe Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (\"PAYGO\") required that automatic payment cuts of 4% be put into place if a statutory\naction is projected to create a net increase in the deficit over either five or 10 years. The enactment of the American Rescue Plan\nAct in 2021 would have triggered PAYGO sequestration in 2021. In the Protecting Medicare & American Farmers from Sequester\nCuts Act, Congress delayed the PAYGO sequestration until January 1, 2023. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 further\nprevented implementation of the PAYGO Medicare 4% sequester through the end of 2024. If not renewed, the PAYGO payment\nadjustment could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn its 2023 DMEPOS Fee Schedule, CMS also announced the fee schedule adjustment based on the annual change to the\nConsumer Pricing Index for all urban areas. Items that were subject to the competitive bidding program in former competitive\nbidding areas will receive a 6.4% reimbursement rate increase. Items that were subject to the competitive bidding program in non-\ncompetitive bidding areas will receive a 9.1% reimbursement rate increase. Items not subject to the competitive bidding program\nwill receive an 8.7% reimbursement rate increase.\nWhile we cannot predict what Medicare payment rates or coverage determinations will be in effect in future years, changes to\npayment rates or benefit coverages may materially impact its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe below table highlights summary financial and operational metrics for the last eight quarters.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except vent patients)\nJune 30, March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30,\nFor the quarter ended 2023 2023 2022 2022 2022 2022 2021 2021\nFinancial Information:\nRevenue $ 43,311 $ 39,556 $ 37,508 $ 35,759 $ 33,310 $ 32,255 $ 31,962 $ 29,285\nGross Profit $ 26,106 $ 24,004 $ 22,896 $ 21,651 $ 20,390 $ 19,743 $ 19,662 $ 18,381\nGross Profit % 60 % 61 % 61 % 61 % 61 % 61 % 62 % 63 %\nNet Income $ 2,330 $ 1,517 $ 2,438 $ 1,055 $ 967 $ 1,762 $ 4,087 $ 1,789\nCash (As of) $ 10,224 $ 23,544 $ 16,914 $ 21,478 $ 21,922 $ 29,248 $ 28,408 $ 26,867\nTotal Assets (As of) $ 149,117 $ 124,634 $ 117,043 $ 119,419 $ 115,904 $ 119,007 $ 117,962 $ 115,486\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) $ 9,810 $ 8,328 $ 9,306 $ 6,982 $ 6,458 $ 7,273 $ 9,549 $ 7,419\nOperational Information:\nVent Patients(2) 10,005 9,337 9,306 9,127 8,837 8,434 8,405 8,200\n(1) Refer to \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section below for definition of Adjusted EBITDA.\n(2) Vent Patients represents the number of active ventilator patients on recurring billing service at the end of each calendar quarter.\nPage 29\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022:\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022:\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n% of Total % of Total $ %\n2023 Revenue 2022 Revenue Change Change\nRevenue $ 43,311 100.0 % $ 33,310 100.0 % $ 10,001 30.0 %\nCost of revenue 17,205 39.7 % 12,920 38.8 % 4,285 33.2 %\nGross profit 26,106 60.3 % 20,390 61.2 % 5,716 28.0 %\nSelling, general and administrative 20,563 47.5 % 17,536 52.6 % 3,027 17.3 %\nResearch and development 758 1.8 % 672 2.0 % 86 12.8 %\nStock-based compensation 1,471 3.4 % 1,271 3.8 % 200 15.7 %\nDepreciation 298 0.7 % 243 0.7 % 55 22.6 %\nLoss (gain) on disposal of property and equipment 117 0.3 % (110) (0.3) % 227 (206.4) %\nOther expense (income) (2) — % (223) (0.7) % 221 (99.1) %\nIncome from operations 2,901 6.7 % 1,001 3.0 % 1,900 189.8 %\nNon-operating income and expenses\nIncome from equity method investments 137 0.3 % 446 1.3 % (309) (69.3) %\nInterest expense, net 20 — % (59) (0.2) % 79 (133.9) %\nNet income before taxes 3,058 7.1 % 1,388 4.2 % 1,670 120.3 %\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes 728 1.7 % 421 1.3 % 307 72.9 %\nNet income $ 2,330 5.4 % $ 967 2.9 % $ 1,363 141.0 %\nRevenue\nThe following table summarizes our revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022:\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n% of Total % of Total $ %\n2023 Revenue 2022 Revenue Change Change\nNet revenue from rentals\nVentilator rentals, non-invasive and invasive $ 25,712 59.4 % $ 22,736 68.3 % $ 2,976 13.1 %\nOther durable medical equipment rentals 8,419 19.4 % 4,912 14.8 % 3,507 71.4 %\nNet revenue from sales and services\nEquipment and supply sales 6,778 15.6 % 3,245 9.7 % 3,533 108.9 %\nCOVID-19 response sales and services — — % 183 0.5 % (183) (100.0) %\nService revenues 2,402 5.6 % 2,234 6.7 % 168 7.5 %\nTotal net revenue $ 43,311 100.0 % $ 33,310 100.0 % $ 10,001 30.0 %\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2023, net revenue totaled $43.3 million, an increase of $10.0 million (or 30.0%) from the\ncomparable period in 2022. Excluding COVID-19 response sales and services revenue, net revenue increased $10.2 million (or\n30.7%) from the comparable period in 2022. The net revenue growth was associated with an increase in ventilator rental revenue\nof $3.0 million (or 13.1%) which can be primarily attributed to the organic expansion of our active ventilator patient base. In addition\nto the ventilator rental revenue growth, net revenue growth was also driven by an increase in rental revenue from other DME\nof $3.5 million (or 71.4%), consisting of rental revenue from continued national expansion of PAP, oxygen therapy, and percussion\nvest activities. Equipment and supply sales increased by $3.5 million (or 108.9%), primarily driven by the continued growth of the\nPAP resupply program and other sleep offerings. Service revenues increased by $0.2 million (or 7.5%) primarily due to the growth\nof healthcare staffing services. While ventilator rentals continue to make up the majority of our revenue, the growth of PAP and\noxygen related sales and services, as well as our healthcare staffing offerings, is contributing significantly to the diversity of our\noverall revenue mix.\nPage 30\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nThere were no COVID-19 response sales and services during the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared to $0.2 million\nduring the three months ended June 30, 2022. The magnitude and persistence of future COVID-19 response sales and services\nrevenue remains uncertain and is dependent on the intensity and length of the COVID-19 pandemic and the demand for ongoing\nservices from primarily governmental customers.\nThe financial results of the acquired operations relating to the recent HMP acquisition (as discussed in Note 3 – Business\nCombinations) were reflected for just one month during the three months ended June 30, 2023, and primarily impacted sleep\nrelated products and services. We expect the HMP acquisition to have a more meaningful impact in the upcoming quarter when\nresults of operations will be reflected for the entire period. The HMP acquisition is expected to further enhance our growth and\noverall profitability.\nCost of revenue and gross profit\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2023, cost of revenue totaled $17.2 million, an increase of $4.3 million (or 33.2%) from the\ncomparable period in 2022. Overall gross profit percentage decreased from 61.2% in the three months ended June 30, 2022 to\n60.3% in the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decline in gross profit percentage is primarily attributable to the migration of\nour revenue mix, which reflects our deliberate efforts towards product and service diversification, aimed at further enhancing our\nmarket position. As a result of subsiding inflationary cost pressures and the positive effects of seasonality in collection rates, gross\nprofit percentage for our normal operations is expected to increase through the end of 2023, partially offset by the impacts of\ncontinued product and service diversification.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 47.5% for the three months ended June\n30, 2023 compared to 52.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2022. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled\n$20.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, an increase of $3.0 million (or 17.3%) from the comparable prior period.\nThe increase in overall selling, general and administrative expense as compared to the prior period is primarily attributable to\nadditional employee related expenses to accommodate the overall growth of the Company. Our full time employee count increased\nfrom 715 on June 30, 2022 to 974 on June 30, 2023, an increase of 36.2%, which was partially due to the acquisition of HMP on\nJune 1, 2023. Employee compensation expenses increased $2.3 million (or 22%) as a result of the increase in our employee\nheadcount and increases in incentive and volume based compensation. We expect that current year selling, general and\nadministrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will continue to improve through the end of 2023 due to increased efficiencies\nand costs stabilization relative to revenue growth.\nResearch and development\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2023, research and development expense totaled $0.8 million, an increase of $0.1 million (or\n12.8%) from the comparable period in 2022. As we continue to invest in research and development related projects to support our\ntechnology initiatives, we expect that associated costs will remain consistent in 2023 relative to 2022 costs.\nStock-based compensation\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2023, stock-based compensation totaled $1.5 million, an increase of 15.7% from the\ncomparable period in 2022. We anticipate that as we expand our workforce, incorporating stock-based awards as a component of\nemployee compensation, stock-based compensation expenses will correspondingly rise. Historically, revenue growth has outpaced\nthe growth in stock-based compensation, and as a result, the percentage of stock-based compensation relative to revenue is\nexpected to continue declining.\nInterest expense, net\nAs a result of the issuance of debt to fund the acquisition of HMP, we expect net interest expense to increase accordingly for the\nremainder of 2023.\nProvision for income taxes\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2023, the provision for income taxes was a $0.7 million expense, compared to $0.4 million\nduring the comparable period in 2022. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the increase in pre-tax income.\nOur annual estimated effective tax rate for 2023 is 28.6%.\nPage 31\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nNet income\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2023, net income was $2.3 million, an increase of $1.4 million (or 141.0%) from the\ncomparable period in 2022.

Net income as a percentage of revenue increased from 4.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2022 to 4.6% for\nthe six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to improvements in selling, general, and administrative expenses associated\nwith increased efficiencies and stabilizing costs.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company uses Adjusted EBITDA, which is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") to analyze its financial results and believes that it is useful to investors, as a\nsupplement to U.S. GAAP measures. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information with respect to the\nCompany’s operating performance as viewed by management, including a view of the Company’s business that is not dependent\non the impact of the Company’s capitalization structure and items that are not part of the Company’s day-to-day operations.\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA (i) to compare the Company’s operating performance on a consistent basis, (ii) to calculate\nincentive compensation for the Company’s employees, (iii) for planning purposes, including the preparation of the Company’s\ninternal annual operating budget, and (iv) to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the Company’s operational strategies.\nAccordingly, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in understanding and evaluating the\nCompany’s operating performance in the same manner as management. In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, certain items (mostly\nnon-cash) are excluded from net income including interest, taxes, stock based compensation, and depreciation of property and\nequipment. Beginning with financial results reported for periods in fiscal year 2023, Adjusted EBITDA also excludes transaction\ncosts and expenses related to acquisition and integration efforts associated with recently announced or completed acquisitions.\nThis modification enables investors to compare period-over-period results on a more consistent basis without the effects of\nacquisitions. We have recast Adjusted EBITDA for prior periods when reported to conform to the modified presentation.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of Net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, on a\nhistorical basis for the periods indicated:\nJune 30, March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30,\nFor the quarter ended 2023 2023 2022 2022 2022 2022 2021 2021\nNet Income $ 2,330 $ 1,517 $ 2,438 $ 1,055 $ 967 $ 1,762 $ 4,087 $ 1,789\nAdd back:\nDepreciation 5,207 4,762 4,373 4,120 3,740 3,397 3,120 2,867\nInterest expense (income) (20) (49) 32 42 59 64 69 75\nStock-based compensation(a) 1,471 1,391 1,317 1,309 1,271 1,305 1,305 1,302\nTransaction costs(b) 94 206 — — — — — —\nIncome tax expense 728 501 1,146 456 421 745 968 1,386\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 9,810 $ 8,328 $ 9,306 $ 6,982 $ 6,458 $ 7,273 $ 9,549 $ 7,419\n(a) Represents non-cash, equity-based compensation expense associated with option and RSU awards.\n(b) Represents transaction costs and expenses related to acquisition and integration efforts associated with recently announced or\ncompleted acquisitions.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in\naccordance with GAAP. It is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an\nalternative to revenue or net income, as applicable, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an\nalternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of the Company's liquidity, and may not be comparable to other\nsimilarly titled measures of other companies or businesses. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA does not\nreflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of ongoing operations; and other\ncompanies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nPage 35\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2023 was $10.2 million, compared to $16.9 million at December 31, 2022. Based on our\ncurrent plan of operations, we believe this amount, when combined with expected cash flows from operations and amounts\navailable under our line of credit will be sufficient to fund our growth strategy and to meet our anticipated operating expenses,\ncapital expenditures, and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months from the date of this filing. The Company utilizes\nshort term financing arrangements with a major supplier that could be extended over a longer term if there was a need for\nadditional liquidity.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nSix Months Ended June 30,\n2023 2022\nNet Cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 18,119 $ 12,092\nInvesting activities (36,112) (10,495)\nFinancing activities 11,303 (8,083)\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (6,690) $ (6,486)\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $18.1 million, resulting from net income\nof $3.8 million, increased by non-cash net income adjustments of $12.3 million and a change in net operating liabilities of $1.7\nmillion, which was offset by a change in net operating assets of $0.3 million. The non-cash net income adjustments primarily\nconsisted of $10.0 million of depreciation, $2.9 million of stock-based compensation, $0.2 million gain on equity investments and a\n$0.7 million change in deferred tax asset. The primary changes in working capital were an increase in net accounts receivable of\n$0.5 million, an increase in income taxes receivable of $1.0 million, offset by a decrease in other assets of $2.1 million and an\nincrease in accrued liabilities of $1.6 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2022 was $12.1 million, primarily resulting from net\nincome of $2.7 million, increased by non-cash net income adjustments of $8.1 million and a change in net operating liabilities of\n$0.3 million, and decreased by a change in net operating assets of $0.3 million. The non-cash net income adjustments primarily\nconsisted of $7.1 million of depreciation, $2.6 million of stock-based compensation, $0.8 million gain on equity investments and a\n$0.7 million change in deferred tax asset. The primary changes in working capital were an increase in net accounts receivable of\n$1.5 million, offset by an increase in income taxes payable of $1.4 million and a decrease in inventory of $1.0 million. Included in\nour operating cash flows for the period is the receipt of $0.4 million in Provider Relief Funds.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $36.1 million, primarily due to the net cash\npaid for the acquisition of HMP of $27.1 million. Net cash used in investing activities during the period also consisted of $10.8\nmillion of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $1.8 million of sales proceeds from the disposal of property and\nequipment. Purchases of property and equipment were primarily related to medical equipment rented to our patients. Cash\npurchases of property and equipment represents a $0.2 million, or 2.1%, decrease year over year.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2022 was $10.5 million, consisting of $11.0 million of\npurchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $0.6 million of sales proceeds from the disposal of property and\nequipment. Purchases of property and equipment were primarily related to medical equipment rented to our patients.\nPage 36\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $11.3 million. For the six months ended\nJune 30, 2023, proceeds from the 2022 Term Loan Facility (as defined below) were $5.0 million and proceeds from the 2022\nRevolving Credit Facility (as defined below) were $8.0 million, which were used to partially fund the cash acquisition of HMP.\nPrincipal payments on acquired revolving and term loans were $2.4 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023. The\nCompany acquired and cancelled 66,734 common shares at a cost of $0.5 million to satisfy employee income tax withholding\nassociated with RSUs vestings while proceeds from the exercise of options during the six months ended June 30, 2023 were $1.2\nmillion.\nNet cash used in financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2022 was $8.1 million. For the six months ended June\n30, 2022, the Company repurchased and canceled 1,350,567 common shares at a cost of $7.0 million pursuant to the Share\nRepurchase Program authorized by the Board of Directors on March 7, 2022 (the \"2022 Share Repurchase Program\"). The\nCompany also acquired and cancelled 23,742 common shares at a cost of $0.1 million to satisfy employee income tax withholding\nassociated with RSUs vesting during the six months ended June 30, 2022. Net cash used in financing activities during the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022 also included $0.9 million in principal payments on the Term Note (as defined below).\nSenior Credit Facilities\nOn November 29, 2022, the Company refinanced its existing borrowings under the prior Commercial Business Loan Agreement\nwith Hancock Whitney Bank and entered into a new credit agreement (the \"2022 Senior Credit Facilities\") with the lenders from\ntime to time party thereto, and Regions Bank, as administrative agent and collateral agent, that provides for an up to $30.0 million\nrevolving credit facility (the \"2022 Revolving Credit Facility\") and an up to $30.0 million delayed draw term loan facility (the \"2022\nTerm Loan Facility\"), both maturing in November 2027.\nThe proceeds of the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility may be used to refinance existing indebtedness, for working capital purposes,\ncapital expenditures and other general corporate purposes (including permitted acquisitions), and to pay transaction fees, costs\nand expenses related to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities. The proceeds of the 2022 Term Loan Facility and any additional term\nloans established in accordance with the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities may be used to finance permitted acquisitions and to pay\ntransaction fees, costs and expenses related to such acquisitions. Outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Term Loan Facility and\n2022 Revolving Credit Facility were $5 million and $8 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2023.\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are Term SOFR (as defined in the 2022 Senior Credit\nFacilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 2.625% to 3.375%, or, at the option of the Company, a Base Rate (as\ndefined in the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 1.625% to 2.375%.\nThe 2022 Senior Credit Facilities require the Company to comply with certain affirmative, as well as certain negative covenants\nthat, among other things, will restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur indebtedness, grant liens,\nmake investments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations and pay dividends and other restricted payments. The 2022\nSenior Credit Facilities also include certain financial covenants, which generally include, but are not limited to the following:\n• Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (defined generally as total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than (i) for\nany fiscal quarter ending during the period from the closing date to and including December 31, 2024, 2.75 to 1.0 and (ii)\nfor any fiscal quarter ending on and after March 31, 2025, 2.50 to 1.0, subject to certain adjustments following a material\nacquisition.\n• Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (defined generally as (a) adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditures minus\ncash taxes to (b) the sum of scheduled principal payments plus cash interest expense plus restricted payments) of not\nless than 1.25:1.0.\nThe Company was in compliance with all covenants under the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities in effect at June 30, 2023.\nPage 37\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nUse of Funds\nOur principal uses of cash are funding the purchase of rental assets and other capital purchases, funding of business\ncombinations, operations, and other working capital requirements. The following table presents our material contractual obligations\nand commitments to make future payments as of June 30, 2023:\nWithin 12 Months Beyond 12 Months\nDebt Obligations, including interest $ 4,374 $ 16,000\nLease Obligations $ 377 $ 257\nTotal $4,751 $16,257\nExcept for the funding of potential business combinations and investments, we anticipate that our operating cash flows will satisfy\nour material cash requirements for the 12 months after June 30, 2023. In addition to our operating cash flows, we may need to\nraise additional funds to support our contractual obligations and investing activities beyond such 12 month period, and such funding\nmay not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, our operations\nand ability to execute our business strategy could be adversely affected. We may seek to raise additional funds through equity,\nequity-linked or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness would have\nrights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. Any additional\nequity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders.\nRetirement Plan\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) retirement plan for employees to which eligible employees can contribute a percentage of their\npre-tax compensation. Matching employer contributions to the 401(k) plan totaled $325,000 and $351,000 for the three months\nended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $735,000 and $622,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nOff balance sheet arrangements\nThe Company has no material undisclosed off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or\nfuture effect on its results of operations or financial condition.\nAccounting and Disclosure Matters\nCritical Accounting Principles and Estimates\nWe are required to disclose “critical accounting estimates” which are estimates made in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and that have had or are reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe follow financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States. The more significant of these policies are summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in\nPart II, Item 8 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Not all significant accounting\npolicies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments. However, the policy noted below could be deemed\nto meet the SEC’s definition of a critical accounting estimate.\nPage 38\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company estimates that a certain portion of receivables from customers may not be collected and maintains an allowance for\ndoubtful accounts. The Company evaluates the net realizable value of accounts receivable as of the date of Consolidated Balance\nSheets. Specifically, we consider historical realization data, including current and historical cash collections, accounts receivable\naging trends, other operating trends and relevant business conditions. Because of continuing changes in the healthcare industry\nand third-party reimbursement, it is possible that the estimates could change, which could have a material impact on the operations\nand cash flows. If circumstances related to certain customers change or actual results differ from expectations, our estimate of the\nrecoverability of receivables could fluctuate from that provided for in our consolidated financial statements. A change in estimate\ncould impact bad debt expense and accounts receivable. The continued volatility in market conditions and evolving shifts in credit\ntrends are difficult to predict causing variability and volatility that may have a material impact on our allowance for doubtful\naccounts in future periods. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $11.0 million and $9.4 million as of June 30, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, and based on our analysis, we believe the reserve is adequate for any exposure to credit losses.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of\nrecently issued accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of\noperations, financial positions and cash flows.\nPage 39\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nNot Applicable.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to\nRule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded:\ni. that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure (a) that information required to be\ndisclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized\nand reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and (b) that such information is accumulated\nand communicated to the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as\nappropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and\nii. that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that the Company's disclosures controls and procedures will detect or\nuncover all failures of persons within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries to disclose material information otherwise\nrequired to be set forth in the Company's periodic reports. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of\ndisclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and\nprocedures.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended June 30,\n2023 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial\nreporting.\nPage 40\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to various ongoing or threatened legal actions and other proceedings, including those that\narise in the ordinary course of business, which may include employment matters, breach of contract disputes, as well as\ngovernmental and regulatory matters. Please read Note 9—Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements for more information. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and to outcomes that are not predictable\nwith assurance and that may not be known for extended periods of time.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors\ndiscussed in “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on March\n2, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Except as set forth below, there have been\nno material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in that Annual Report.\nOur strategic growth plan, which involves the acquisition of other businesses, may not succeed.\nThe Company's strategic growth plan calls for significant growth in its business over the next several years through an increase in\nits density in select markets where it is established as well as the expansion of its geographic footprint into new markets. This\ngrowth would place (and has placed) significant demands on the Company’s management team, systems, internal controls and\nfinancial and professional resources. As a result, the Company could be required to incur (and has incurred) expenses for hiring\nadditional qualified personnel, retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems and expanding the\nCompany’s information technology infrastructure. If the Company is unable to effectively manage growth, its financial results could\nbe adversely impacted.\nThe Company’s strategic growth plan contemplates continued growth from future acquisitions of home medical equipment and\nservice providers. The Company may face increased competition for attractive acquisition candidates, which may limit the number\nof acquisition opportunities available to the Company or lead to the payment of higher prices for its acquisitions. Without successful\nacquisitions, the Company’s future growth rate could decline. In addition, the Company cannot guarantee that any future\nacquisitions, if consummated, will result in further growth.\nThe integration of acquisitions requires significant attention from management, may impose substantial demands on the\nCompany’s operations or other projects and may impose challenges on us including, but not limited to, consistencies in business\nstandards, procedures, policies and business cultures. There can be no assurance that any future acquisitions, if consummated,\nwill result in further growth. Specific integration risks relating to the acquisition of other businesses by the Company may include:\ndifficulties related to combining previously separate businesses into a single unit, including patient transitions, product and service\nofferings, distribution and operational capabilities and business cultures;availability of financing to the extent needed to fund\nacquisitions;customer loss and other general business disruption; managing the integration process while completing other\nindependent acquisitions or dispositions;diversion of management’s attention from day-to-day operations; assumption of liabilities\nof an acquired business, including unforeseen or contingent liabilities or liabilities in excess of the amounts estimated; failure to\nrealize anticipated benefits and synergies, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; potentially substantial costs and\nexpenses associated with acquisitions and dispositions; and failure to retain and motivate key employees difficulties in establishing\nand applying the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures to an acquired\nbusiness.\nPage 41\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022\nItem 2.

The 2022 Share Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or\ndiscontinued at any time.\nDividends\nWe have not declared or paid any cash or stock dividends on our common shares since our inception and do not anticipate\ndeclaring or paying any cash or stock dividends in the foreseeable future.

Nature of Business and Operations\nViemed Healthcare, Inc. (the \"Company\"), through its subsidiaries, is a provider of home medical equipment (\"HME\") and post-\nacute respiratory healthcare services in the United States. The Company’s service offerings are focused on effective in-home\ntreatment with clinical practitioners providing therapy and counseling to patients in their homes using cutting edge technology. The\nCompany currently serves patients in all 50 states of the United States. The Company was incorporated under the Business\nCorporations Act (British Columbia) on December 14, 2016. The Company's registered and records office is located at Suite 2800,\nPark Place, 666 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia V6C 2Z7 and its corporate office is located at 625 E. Kaliste Saloom\nRoad, Lafayette, Louisiana 70508.\nThe Company is an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \"JOBS Act\"), and as\nsuch, has elected to comply with certain reduced U.S. public company reporting requirements.\nBased on the annual assessment performed on June 30, 2022, the Company meets the re-entry thresholds to qualify as a \"smaller\nreporting company\" under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and, as such,\nhas elected to comply with certain reduced U.S. public company reporting requirements.\nThe Company’s common shares are traded in the U.S. on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \"VMD\" and in Canada on\nthe Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol \"VMD.TO\".\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and\nfootnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements\nare unaudited, but reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals, which, in the opinion of management, are\nnecessary to present fairly the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nIncome and Comprehensive Income, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity and Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the interim periods presented. The Company's fiscal year ends on December 31. The\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022 was derived from audited consolidated financial statements but\ndoes not include all disclosures required by GAAP. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in\nconjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the report of the Company's independent\nregistered public accounting firm included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe nature of the Company's business is such that the results of any interim period may not be indicative of the results to be\nexpected for the entire year.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany\ntransactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date\nof the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiod. Management bases these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience, existing and known circumstances,\nauthoritative accounting pronouncements and other factors that management believes to be reasonable. Significant areas requiring\nthe use of management estimates relate to revenue recognition, accounts receivable and the related allowance for doubtful\naccounts, income tax provisions, and fair value of financial instruments. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nPage 7\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company’s chief operating decision-makers (\"CODMs\") are its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, who make\nresource allocation decisions and assess performance based on financial information presented on an aggregate basis. There are\nno segment managers who are held accountable by the chief operating decision-makers, or anyone else, for any planning, strategy\nand key decision-making regarding operations. The corporate office is responsible for contract negotiation with vendors and\npayors, corporate compliance with healthcare laws and regulations, and revenue cycle management, among other corporate\nsupporting functions. Accordingly, the Company has a single reportable segment and operating segment structure based on ASC\n280, Segment Reporting.\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts receivable are regularly reviewed for collectability and an allowance is recorded to cover the estimated bad debts and\nbilling modifications. The accounts receivable are presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets net of the allowance\nfor doubtful accounts. It is possible that the estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts could change, which could have a\nmaterial impact on our operations and cash flows.\nThe Company writes off receivables when the likelihood for collection is remote, and when the Company believes collection efforts\nhave been fully exhausted and it does not intend to devote additional resources in attempting to collect. The write-offs are charged\nagainst the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, our evaluation takes into consideration such factors as historical bad debt and billing\nmodification experience, national and local economic trends and conditions, industry and regulatory conditions, other collection\nindicators and information about disaggregated receivables. The complexity of many third-party billing arrangements, patient\nqualification for medical necessity of equipment and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain\npayors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded.\nThe estimates and charge-offs for the allowance for doubtful accounts for each reporting period were as follows:\nMarch 31, 2023 March 31, 2022\nBalance, beginning of year $ 8,483 $ 7,031\nProvision for uncollectible accounts 4,131 3,445\nAmounts charged off (1,574) (1,992)\nBalance, end of period $ 11,040 $ 8,484\nIncluded in accounts receivable at March 31, 2023 are amounts due from Medicare and Medicaid, representing 35% and 10%,\nrespectively, and 45% combined, of total outstanding receivables. As of December 31, 2022, 48% of total outstanding receivables\nwere amounts due from Medicare and Medicaid.\nRevenues from Medicare and Medicaid as percentages of the Company's traditional revenue streams, excluding COVID-19\nresponse sales and services, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2023 2022\nMedicare revenues 45 % 49 %\nMedicaid revenues 9 % 9 %\nTotal Medicare and Medicaid revenues 54 % 58 %\nInventory\nInventory represents non-serialized supplies that consist of equipment parts, consumables, and associated product supplies and is\nexpensed at the time of sale or use. The Company values inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Obsolete and\nunserviceable inventories are valued at estimated net realizable value.\nPage 8\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment is presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at historic cost less accumulated\ndepreciation. Major renewals and improvements that extend the useful life of assets are capitalized to the respective property\naccounts, while maintenance and repairs, which do not extend the useful life of the respective assets, are expensed as incurred.\nManagement has estimated the useful lives of equipment leased to customers. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line\nmethod over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Property and equipment are amortized on a straight-line basis over\ntheir estimated useful lives.\nDepreciation of medical equipment commences at the date of service, which represents the date that the asset has been delivered\nto a patient and is put in use and continues through the useful life of the asset. Property and equipment with definite useful lives are\ntested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nEquity investments\nEquity investments on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets are comprised of an investment accounted for under the\nequity method and equity investments without readily determinable fair values accounted for under the measurement alternative\ndescribed in ASC 321-10-35-2.\nThe following table details the Company’s equity investments:\nMarch 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nEquity method investments $ 655 $ 816\nOther equity investments 1,339 1,339\nBalance, end of period $ 1,994 $ 2,155\nThe Company's equity method investments include a 49% equity interest in Solvet Services, LLC, an entity which provides health\ncare support services to state and federal governments. Investments accounted for under the equity method are investments in\nunconsolidated entities over whose operating and financial policies the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence but\nnot control. Equity method investments are initially measured at cost in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets with any\nsubsequent adjustments made to the carrying amount of the investment for the Company’s proportionate share of income or loss.\nThe Company has recognized its share of income or loss on the gain (loss) from equity method investments within non-operating\nexpenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Equity method investments are evaluated for impairment\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investments may exceed the fair value. No\nevents or changes have occurred as of March 31, 2023 that would impair the carrying value of equity method investments.\nOther equity investments include an equity interest in VeruStat, Inc., a remote patient monitoring entity, and an equity interest in\nDMEscripts, LLC, an e-prescribing platform. Other equity investments are investments without a readily determinable fair value\nwhich do not qualify for the practical expedient in ASC 820. For these investments, the Company has elected the measurement\nalternative which measures the investment at cost, less any impairment. ASU 2019-04 clarifies that if an entity identifies observable\nprice changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer, it must measure its equity\ninvestment at fair value in accordance with ASC 820 as of the date that the observable transaction occurred. The Company was\nnot aware of any impairment or observable price change adjustments that needed to be made as of March 31, 2023 on its\ninvestments in equity securities without a readily determinable fair value.\nDebt Investment\nThe Company's debt investment is a variable rate secured convertible note issued by Healthcare DX, Inc. (d/b/a ModoHealth) on\nDecember 21, 2022, classified as an available-for-sale debt instrument. Accrued interest is due upon the 18 month maturity of the\nnote and is included in the amortized cost basis at each reporting period. At each financial statement date until a conversion event,\nthe debt instrument is required to be remeasured at fair value. Changes in unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated\nother comprehensive income, net of tax effect, until realized.\nPage 9\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\nComprehensive income\nComprehensive income reflects the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events\nand circumstances from non-owner sources. The Company's comprehensive income represents net income adjusted for unrealized\ngains and losses on derivative instruments, net of tax. Accumulated other comprehensive loss is presented on the accompanying\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of shareholders' equity.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue from a customer consists of sales and rentals of home medical equipment and patient medical services. Patient revenues\nare billed to and collections received from Medicare, Medicaid, third-party insurers, co-insurance and patient-pay. Patient revenue\nis recognized net of contractual adjustments and bad debt based on contractual arrangements with third-party payors, an\nevaluation of expected collections resulting from the analysis of current and past due accounts, past collection experience in\nrelation to amounts billed and other relevant information. Contractual adjustments result from the differences between the rates\ncharged for services and reimbursement rates paid by government-sponsored healthcare programs and insurance companies for\nsuch services.\nThe Company's contracts with customers often include multiple products and services, and the Company evaluates these\narrangements to determine the unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes based on whether the product or service is\ndistinct from other products or services in the arrangement and should be accounted for as a separate performance obligation. A\nproduct or service is distinct if the customer can benefit from it on its own or together with other readily available resources and the\nCompany's ability to transfer the goods or services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contractual arrangement\nwith the customer (e.g. patient). Revenue is then allocated to each separately identifiable good or service based on the standalone\nprice of the items underlying the performance obligations. Most of the Company’s products fall in the Medicare Fee-for-Service\n(“FFS”) program which is a payment model where services are unbundled and paid for separately. These services are paid based\non a Medicare determined price that is publicly available on the website for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”).\nFor commercial payors, HME companies must negotiate in-network pricing separately, though in general, the Company’s payors\ntend to benchmark their contract rates and coverage policies closely to those of Medicare.\nThe Company considers performance obligations for sales and rentals to be met when the customer receives the equipment, and\nrevenue for rentals is recognized over time, over the respective rental period. For revenue associated with HME rentals, the\nCompany recognizes revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 842, “Leases,” (Topic 842). For any HME sales and services, the\nCompany recognizes revenue under FASB ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” (Topic 606) and related\namendments.\nThe Company recognizes equipment rental revenue over the non-cancelable lease term, which varies based on the type of\nequipment rental, less estimated adjustments, in accordance with Topic 842. The Company has separate contracts with each\npatient that are not subject to a master lease agreement with any third-party payor. The Company would first consider the lease\nclassification issue (sales-type lease or operating lease) and then appropriately recognize or defer rental revenue over the lease\nterm.\nPage 10\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\nRevenues associated with external staffing services are accrued on an hourly basis and are recorded based on the determination\nof whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent. In arrangements in which the Company manages customers'\nsupplemental workforce needs utilizing its own network of healthcare professionals, the Company is determined to be a principal\nand includes the contractual gross billings in revenues with a corresponding increase to cost of revenues for worksite employee\npayroll costs associated with these services. Alternatively, when the Company acts as agent in the performance of workforce\nmanagement, revenue is recorded based on contractually agreed upon fees or commissions with no associated cost of revenues.\nThe revenues from each major source are summarized in the following table:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2023 2022\nRevenue from rentals under Topic 842\nVentilator rentals, non-invasive and invasive $ 25,147 $ 21,518\nOther durable medical equipment rentals 6,906 4,359\nRevenue from sales and services under Topic 606\nEquipment and supply sales 4,764 3,037\nCOVID-19 response sales and services — 2,095\nService revenues 2,739 1,246\nTotal revenues $ 39,556 $ 32,255\nRevenue Accounting under Topic 842\nThe Company leases HME such as non-invasive and invasive ventilators, positive airway pressure (\"PAP\") machines, percussion\nvests, oxygen concentrator units and other small respiratory equipment to customers for a fixed monthly amount on a month-to-\nmonth basis. The customer generally has the right to cancel the lease at any time during the rental period. The Company accounts\nfor these rentals as operating leases.\nUnder FASB ASC Topic 842, the Company recognizes rental revenue on operating leases on a straight-line basis over the\ncontractual lease term which varies based on the type of equipment rental. The lease term begins on the date equipment is\ndelivered to patients, and revenues are recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with\nthird-party payors, including Medicare, private commercial payors, and Medicaid. Certain customer co-payments are included in\nrevenue when considered probable of payment, which is generally when paid.\nDue to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which the Company operates, certain estimates are\nrequired to record net revenue and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that\nthey will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. Specifically, the complexity of many third-party\nbilling arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in\nadjustments to amounts originally recorded. Such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application\nor claim denial.\nRevenue Accounting under Topic 606\nThe Company sells HME, replacement parts and supplies to customers and recognizes revenue based on contractual payment\nrates as determined by the payors at the point in time where control of the good or service is transferred through delivery to the\ncustomer. The customer and, if applicable, the payors are generally charged at the time that the product is sold. For sales of\nequipment previously placed in service, proceeds associated with these sales are recorded to gain (loss) on disposal of property\nand equipment.\nThe Company also provides sleep study services to customers and recognizes revenue when the sleep study results are complete,\nsatisfying the performance obligation. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company began offering contact and vaccine\ntracing services, which revenues are recognized in the period in which the service has been provided. The transaction price on\nequipment sales, sleep studies, and contact and vaccine tracing is the amount that the Company expects to receive in exchange\nfor the goods and services provided. Due to the nature of the HME business, gross charges are retail charges and generally do not\nreflect what the Company is ultimately paid. As such, the transaction price is constrained for the difference between the gross\ncharge and what is estimated to be collected from payors and from patients. The transaction price therefore is predominantly based\nPage 11\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\non contractual payment rates as determined by the payors. The payment terms and conditions of customer contracts vary by\ncustomer type and the products and services offered.\nFor staffing services, performance obligations in the staffing agreements are satisfied over time when the customer simultaneously\nreceives and consumes the benefits provided. Accordingly, revenues from staffing services are recognized on an hourly basis as\nservices are rendered by the job site employee in both principal and agent arrangements.\nThe Company determines its estimates of contractual allowances and discounts based upon contractual agreements, its policies\nand historical experience. While the rates are fixed for the product or service with the customer and the payors, such amounts\ntypically include co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles, which vary in amounts, and are due from the patient. The Company\nincludes in the transaction price only the amount that the Company expects to be entitled, which is substantially all of the payor\nbillings at contractual rates. The transaction price is initially constrained by the amount of customer co-payments, which are\nincluded in the transaction price when considered probable of payment and included in revenue if the product or service has\nalready been provided to the customer.\nDue to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which the Company operates, certain estimates are\nrequired to record net revenue and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Inherent in these estimates is the risk that\nthey will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. Specifically, the complexity of many third-party\nbilling arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in\nadjustments to amounts originally recorded. Such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application\nor claim denial.\nReturns and refunds are not accepted on equipment sales, sleep study services, staffing services, or contact and vaccine tracing\nservices. The Company does not offer warranties to customers in excess of the manufacturer’s warranty. Any taxes due upon sale\nof the products or services are not recognized as revenue. The Company does not have any partially or unfilled performance\nobligations related to contracts with customers and as such, the Company has no contract liabilities as of March 31, 2023.\nStock-based compensation\nThe Company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, \"Compensation—Stock Compensation\",\nwhich establishes accounting for share-based awards exchanged for employee services and requires companies to expense the\nestimated fair value of these awards over the requisite employee service period. Stock–based compensation costs for stock\noptions are determined at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Stock-based compensation costs for\nrestricted stock units (\"RSUs\") are determined at the grant date based on the closing stock price. The expense of such stock-based\ncompensation awards is recognized using the graded vesting attribution method over the vesting period and the offsetting credit is\nrecorded as an increase in additional paid-in capital. Forfeitures are recorded as incurred. Any excess tax benefit or deficiency is\nrecognized as a component of income taxes and within operating cash flows upon vesting of the share-based award.\nFor the Company’s phantom share units settled in cash, the Company computes the fair value of the phantom share units using the\nclosing price of the Company's stock at the end of each period and records a liability based on the percentage of requisite service.\nInterest rate swaps\nThe Company utilized an interest rate swap contract to reduce exposure to fluctuations in variable interest rates for future interest\npayments on the 2019 Term Note (as defined below).\nFor determining the fair value of the interest rate swap contract, the Company uses significant other observable market data or\nassumptions (Level 2 inputs) that market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities, including assumptions about\ncounterparty risk. These fair value estimates reflect an income approach based on the terms of the interest rate swap contract and\ninputs corroborated by observable market data including interest rate curves. The Company presents a positive ending period fair\nvalue of the interest rate swap contract in other long-term assets, as a component of long-term assets, and a negative ending\nperiod fair value of the interest rate swap contract in accrued liabilities, as a component of long-term liabilities on the Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company recognized any differences between the variable interest rate payments and the fixed interest rate settlements from\nits swap counterparty as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swap. If determined to be an effective cash flow\nhedge, the Company will record the changes in the estimated fair value of the swaps to accumulated other comprehensive income\nor loss on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. To the extent that interest rate swaps are determined to be ineffective, the\nPage 12\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\nCompany would recognize the changes in the estimated fair value of swaps in interest and other non-operating expenses, net in its\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Income.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company settled its interest rate swap in connection with the refinancing of its\ncredit facilities and recognized the realized gain of $0.2 million in Other Income.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in numerous U.S. jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the\nprovision for income taxes. The Company's income tax provisions reflect management’s interpretation of country and state tax\nlaws. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course\nof business and may remain uncertain for several years after their occurrence. The Company recognizes assets and liabilities for\ntaxation when it is probable that the Company will receive refunds from or pay taxes to the relevant tax authority. Where the final\ndetermination of tax assets and liabilities is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the\ncurrent and deferred income taxes provision in the period in which such a determination is made. Changes in tax law or changes in\nthe way tax law is interpreted may also impact the Company's effective tax rate as well as the Company's business and operations.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future income tax consequences attributable to temporary\ndifferences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases. Deferred\nincome tax assets or liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in\nwhich those temporary differences are expected to be settled. The calculation of current and deferred income taxes requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions and to exercise a certain amount of judgment concerning the carrying value of\nassets and liabilities. The current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are also impacted by expectations about future\noperating results and the timing of reversal of temporary differences as well as possible audits of tax filings by regulatory agencies.\nChanges or differences in these estimates or assumptions may result in changes to the current and deferred tax assets and\nliabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and a charge to or recovery of income tax expense.\nCARES Act Funds Received\nThe Company received a general distribution payment from the Provider Relief Fund of $3.5 million in April 2020, a targeted\ndistribution payment of $1.5 million in November 2021, and a general distribution payment of $0.4 million in January 2022. The\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") has stated that Provider Relief Fund payments are not loans and will not\nneed to be repaid. However, as a condition to the receipt of funds, the Company and any other providers must agree to a detailed\nset of terms and conditions. CMS has indicated that the terms and conditions may be subject to ongoing changes and reporting.\nThere is no US GAAP guidance for for-profit health care entities that receive government grants that are not in the form of an\nincome tax credit, revenue from a contract with a customer or a loan. As such, for-profit entities must determine the appropriate\naccounting treatment by analogy to other guidance such as International Accounting Standards (IAS) 20, Accounting for\nGovernment Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance, in International Financial Reporting Standards. Under IAS 20, the\nCompany determined that upon receipt of funds, it fully complied with the conditions attached to the grant. The Company\nrecognized the distributions received from the Provider Relief Fund in the income statement in full during the period of receipt. To\nthe extent that reporting requirements and terms and conditions are modified, it may affect the Company's ability to comply and\nmay require the return of funds. The Company is not aware of any such modifications as of March 31, 2023.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nOn January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on\nFinancial Instruments. The standard replaces the current incurred loss impairment model that recognizes losses when a probable\nthreshold is met with a requirement to recognize lifetime expected credit losses immediately when a financial asset is originated or\npurchased. Further, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04 and ASU 2019-05 to provide additional guidance on the credit losses standard.\nWhile the adoption of ASC 326 could result in a higher allowance recorded in the future for credit losses on receivables within the\nscope of the standard due to the prescribed measurement principles, the impact of the adoption on the Company's consolidated\nfinancials statements was not material.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company” as defined by the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth\ncompany can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can selectively\ndelay the adoption of all accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company\nPage 13\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\nhas elected to utilize this exemption and, as a result, the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements may not be\ncomparable to the financial statements of issuers that are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting\nstandards that are applicable to public companies. To date, however, the Company has not delayed the adoption of any accounting\nstandards except as noted below. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that the Company can elect to opt out of the extended\ntransition period at any time, which election is irrevocable.\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, Liabilities — Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of\nSupplier Finance Program Obligations, which requires entities that use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase\nof goods and services to disclose the key terms of the programs and information about their obligations that are outstanding at the\nend of the reporting period. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022,\nincluding interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company does not expect the update to affect the recognition, measurement, or\nfinancial statement presentation of supplier finance program obligations, but is evaluating the impact of the update on related\ndisclosures upon adoption.\n3. Property and Equipment\nThe Company’s fixed assets consist of its medical equipment held for rental, furniture and equipment, real property and related\nimprovements, and vehicles and other various small equipment.\nThe following table details the Company’s fixed assets:\nMarch 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nMedical equipment $ 96,848 $ 93,893\nFurniture and equipment 2,886 2,792\nLand 2,566 2,566\nBuildings 7,602 7,737\nLeasehold improvements 296 296\nVehicles 1,051 1,052\nLess: Accumulated depreciation (42,811) (39,899)\nProperty and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization $ 68,438 $ 68,437\nDepreciation in the amount of $4,522,000 and $3,160,000 is included in cost of revenue for the three months ended March 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding finance lease obligations.\nMedical equipment purchases with a cost of $1,709,000 and $738,000 were included in accounts payable at March 31,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n4. Current Liabilities\nThe Company’s short-term accrued liabilities are included within current liabilities and consist of the following:\nMarch 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nAccrued trade payables $ 2,398 $ 2,254\nAccrued commissions payable 679 608\nAccrued bonuses payable 2,295 3,708\nAccrued vacation and payroll 2,841 1,484\nCurrent portion of phantom share liability 2,148 1,704\nAccrued other liabilities 2,456 1,334\nTotal accrued liabilities $ 12,817 $ 11,092\nPage 14\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\n5. Debt\n2018 Senior Credit Facility\nOn February 20, 2018, the Company entered a Commercial Business Loan Agreement (the \"2018 Senior Credit Facility\") that\nprovided for Term Loans and Lines of Credit with Hancock Whitney Bank. Until November 29, 2022, the Company maintained a\nline of credit in the amount of $10.0 million under the 2018 Senior Credit Facility. On May 30, 2019, the Company entered into a\nterm note (“Building Term Note”) under the 2018 Senior Credit Facility in the principal amount of $4.8 million. The proceeds of the\nBuilding Term Note were used to purchase the Company's corporate headquarters. In connection with the Building Term Note, the\nCompany entered into an interest rate swap transaction (\"Interest Rate Swap Transaction\") with Hancock Whitney Bank effectively\nfixing the interest rate for the Building Term Note at 4.68%. On September 19, 2019, the Company entered into an additional loan\nagreement providing for a term note (the “2019 Term Note\") under the 2018 Senior Credit Facility in the principal amount of $5.0\nmillion and bearing an annual interest rate of 4.60%. The proceeds of the 2019 Term Note were utilized for general corporate\npurposes. The 2019 Term Note matured on September 19, 2022 at which time the entire unpaid balance of principal and interest\nwas repaid in full. In connection with the entry in to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities on November 29, 2022, the Company retired\nthe 2018 Senior Credit Facility, and repaid all outstanding interest and principal in full.\n2022 Senior Credit Facilities\nOn November 29, 2022, the Company refinanced its existing borrowings under the 2018 Senior Credit Facility and entered into a\nnew credit agreement (the \"2022 Senior Credit Facilities\") with the lenders from time to time party thereto, and Regions Bank, as\nadministrative agent (the \"Administrative Agent\") and collateral agent, that provides for an up to $30.0 million revolving credit facility\n(the \"2022 Revolving Credit Facility\") and an up to $30.0 million delayed draw term loan facility (the \"2022 Term Loan Facility\"),\nboth maturing in November 2027.\nThe proceeds of the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility may be used to refinance existing indebtedness, for working capital purposes,\ncapital expenditures and other general corporate purposes (including permitted acquisitions), and to pay transaction fees, costs\nand expenses related to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities. The proceeds of the 2022 Term Loan Facility and any additional term\nloans established in accordance with the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities may be used to finance permitted acquisitions and to pay\ntransaction fees, costs and expenses related to such acquisitions.\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are Term SOFR (as defined in the 2022 Senior Credit\nFacilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 2.625% to 3.375%, or, at the option of the Company, a Base Rate (as\ndefined in the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 1.625% to 2.375%.\nThe 2022 Senior Credit Facilities require the Company to comply with certain affirmative, as well as certain negative covenants\nthat, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make\ninvestments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations and pay dividends and other restricted payments. The 2022 Senior\nCredit Facilities also include certain financial covenants, which generally include, but are not limited to the following:\n• Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (defined generally as total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than (i) for\nany fiscal quarter ending during the period from the closing date to and including December 31, 2024, 2.75 to 1.0 and (ii)\nfor any fiscal quarter ending on and after March 31, 2025, 2.50 to 1.0, subject to certain adjustments following a material\nacquisition.\n• Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (defined generally as (a) adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditures minus\ncash taxes to (b) the sum of scheduled principal payments plus cash interest expense plus restricted payments) of not\nless than 1.25:1.0.\nThe Company was in compliance with all covenants under the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities in effect at March 31, 2023.\nPage 15\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe 2022 Senior Credit Facilities includes provisions permitting the Company from time to time to, subject to certain terms and\nconditions, increase the aggregate amount of commitments under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility and/or establish one or more\nadditional term loans under the 2022 Term Loan Facility, in each case, with additional commitments from existing lenders or new\ncommitments from financial institutions acceptable to the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion; provided, that, (a) the\naggregate principal amount of any increases in the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, and (b) the aggregate principal amount of all\nadditional term loans under the 2022 Term Loan Facility established after the closing date will not exceed $30.0 million.\nFinancing costs and commitment fees related to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are capitalized and amortized over the term of the\nloans using the effective interest method.\nThere were no outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities at March 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.\n6. Fair Value Measurement\nUnder ASC Topic 820, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (i.e., an exit price). ASC Topic 820 establishes a\nhierarchy for inputs to valuation techniques used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and\nminimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. There are three\nlevels to the hierarchy based on the reliability of inputs, as follows:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or\nsimilar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value\nis greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no transfers between fair value\nmeasurement levels during any presented period.\nPage 16\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe following tables summarize the Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31,\n2023 and December 31, 2022:\nAt March 31, 2023\n(In thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements:\nMoney market mutual funds $ 15,538 $ — $ — $ 15,538\nAvailable for sale debt instrument — — 2,057 2,057\nTotal $ 15,538 $ — $ 2,057 $ 17,595\nAt December 31, 2022\n(In thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements:\nMoney market mutual funds $ 11,005 $ — $ — $ 11,005\nAvailable for sale debt instrument — — 2,000 2,000\nTotal $ 11,005 $ — $ 2,000 $ 13,005\nAvailable for Sale Debt Instrument\nThe fair value of the Company’s available for sale debt instrument approximates its amortized cost basis due to the short maturity\nand indexed interest rate terms. The fair value is classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the Company evaluates\nadjustments using a combination of observable and unobservable inputs, such as operating results of the counterparty as well\nobservable prices in transactions of debt and equity instruments of the issuing counterparty when available. As of March 31, 2023,\nthe analysis resulted in no adjustments to the carrying value impacting unrealized gains or losses. All changes to measured fair\nvalue during the period were the result of accrued interest.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nThe Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets and liabilities include\nequity method investments and other equity investments. Equity method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investments may exceed the fair value. The Company's\nother equity investments are holdings in privately-held companies without a readily determinable market value. The Company\nremeasures equity securities without readily determinable fair value at fair value when an orderly transaction is identified for an\nidentical or similar investment of the same issuer in accordance with the measurement alternative under Topic 820. ASU 2019-04\nstates that the measurement alternative is a nonrecurring fair value measurement. Accordingly, other equity investments without\nreadily determinable fair value are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because the Company estimates the value\nusing a combination of observable and unobservable inputs, including valuation ascribed to the issuing company in subsequent\nfinancing rounds, volatility in the results of operations of the issuers and rights and obligations of the holdings the Company owns.\nThe Company had no material adjustments of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during any of the\nperiods presented. There were no transfers between fair value measurement levels during any presented period.\nPage 17\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\n7. Shareholders' Equity\nAuthorized share capital\nThe Company’s authorized share capital consists of an unlimited number of common shares, with no stated par value.\nIssued and outstanding share capital\nThe Company has only one class of stock outstanding, common shares. The authorized stock consists of an unlimited number of\ncommon shares with no stated par value, of which 38,276,389 and 38,049,739 shares were issued and outstanding as of March\n31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company acquired and cancelled 64,756 common shares at a cost of $0.5 million\nto satisfy employee income tax withholding associated with RSUs vesting. The Company’s retained earnings were reduced by the\namount paid for the shares repurchased and cancelled.\nStock-based compensation\nEffective June 11, 2020 (the \"Effective Date\"), the Company’s shareholders approved the Company's 2020 Long Term Incentive\nPlan (the \"Omnibus Plan\"). Upon approval of the Omnibus Plan, no future awards are available to be made under the Company's\nprevious RSU and Option Plans (collectively, the \"Former Plan\"), and the common shares that were not settled or awarded under\nthe Former Plan as of the Effective Date are available for awards under the Omnibus Plan. The maximum number of common\nshares that are available for awards under the Omnibus Plan and under any other security-based compensation arrangements\nadopted by the Company, including the Former Plan, may not exceed 7,758,211 shares (equal to 20% of the issued and\noutstanding common shares of the Company on the Effective Date). The maximum amount of the foregoing common shares that\nmay be awarded under the Omnibus Plan as “incentive stock options” is 2,600,000 common shares. As of March 31, 2023, the\nCompany had outstanding options of 4,368,000 and RSUs of 1,130,000 associated with common shares under the Omnibus Plan.\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 (in\nthousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2023 2022\nStock-based compensation - options $ 348 $ 820\nStock-based compensation - restricted stock units 1,043 485\nTotal $ 1,391 $ 1,305\nAt March 31, 2023, there was approximately $1,189,000 of total unrecognized pre-tax stock option expense under the Company's\nequity compensation plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.53 years. As of March 31,\n2023, there was approximately $5,922,000 of total unrecognized pre-tax compensation expense related to outstanding time-based\nrestricted stock units that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.48 years.\nPage 18\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\nOptions\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the three months ended March 31, 2023:\nNumber of Weighted average\noptions Weighted average remaining Aggregate\n(000's) exercise price(1) contractual life intrinsic value(2)\nBalance December 31, 2022 4,497 $ 5.26 6.9 years $ 11,356\nIssued — —\nExercised (108) 5.19\nExpired / Forfeited (21) 6.68\nBalance March 31, 2023 4,368 $ 5.26 6.7 years $ 19,264\n(1)For presentation purposes, stock options issued with a Canadian dollar exercise price have been translated to U.S. dollars based on the\nprevailing exchange rate on the date of grant.\n(2)The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding represents the difference between the exercise price of the option and the closing stock price\nof the Company's common shares on the last trading day of the period ($9.66).\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding was $19,263,947 and options exercisable was $16,609,299 at March 31,\n2023. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, 108,370 common shares were issued pursuant to the exercise of stock options.\nAt March 31, 2023, the Company had 3,521,000 exercisable stock options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of\n$4.95 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 6.2 years. At December 31, 2022, the Company had 2,841,000\nexercisable stock options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $4.53 and a weighted average remaining\ncontractual life of 6.1 years.\nThe fair value of the stock options has been charged to the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income and\ncredited to additional paid-in capital over the vesting period, using the grant date fair value based on the Black-Scholes option\npricing model. The assumptions used to determine the grant date fair value of stock options include exercise price, risk-free interest\nrates, expected volatility, and average life of an option. The risk-free interest rates are based on the rates available at the time of\nthe grant for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the option’s expected life. The average life of an\noption is based on both historical and projected exercise and lapsing data. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from\ntraded options on the Company's common shares and historical volatility of the Company's common shares over the expected life\nof the option. There were no issuances of options during three months ended March 31, 2023.\nRestricted stock units\nThe Company accounts for RSUs using fair value. The fair value of the RSUs has been charged to the Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Income and Comprehensive Income and credited to additional paid-in capital over the vesting period, based on the\nstock price on the date of grant. RSUs vest generally over a one or three-year period. The Company accounts for forfeitures on\nRSUs under ASU 2016-09 and recognizes forfeitures in the period in which they occur.\nThe following table summarizes RSU activity for the three months ended March 31, 2023:\nWeighted\nWeighted average Aggregate\nNumber of average grant remaining intrinsic\nRSUs (000's) price contractual life value(1)\nBalance December 31, 2022 629 $ 5.62 0.88 years $ 4,755\nIssued 702 7.87\nVested (183) 5.56\nExpired / Forfeited (18) 6.71\nBalance March 31, 2023 1,130 $ 7.01 1.48 years $ 10,915\n(1)The aggregate intrinsic value of time-based RSUs outstanding was based on the Company's closing stock price on the last trading day of the\nperiod ($9.66).\nPage 19\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company issued 702,206 RSUs with a vesting term of three years and a fair\nvalue of $7.87 per share.\nPhantom share units\nThe Company has a phantom share unit plan, which it uses for grants to directors, officers, and employees. Phantom share units\ngranted under the plan are non-assignable and are settled in cash at vesting based on the fair value of the Company's common\nstock on the vesting date. Phantom share units vest annually over a three-year period. The cash-settled phantom share units are\naccounted for as liability awards and are re-measured at fair value each reporting period until they become vested with accrued\nliability and related expense being recognized over the requisite service period.\nThe following table summarizes phantom share unit activity for the three months ended March 31, 2023:\nNumber of phantom Value of share\nshare units (000's) equivalents(1)\nBalance December 31, 2022 512 $ 3,878\nIssued 176 $ 1,401\nVested (74) $ (578)\nExpired / Forfeited (17) $ (165)\nBalance March 31, 2023 597 $ 5,767\n(1)The value of outstanding share equivalents at the beginning of the period is based on the market price of the Company’s stock at that time, the\nvalue of issued share equivalents is based on the market price of the Company’s stock at issuance, the value of vested share equivalents is based\non the cash paid at the time of vesting, the values of expired/forfeited share equivalents and outstanding share equivalents at the end of the period\nand are based on the market price of the Company's stock at the end of the period. The market price of the Company's stock was $9.66 on March\n31, 2023.\nThe change in fair value of the phantom share units has been charged to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and\nComprehensive Income and recorded as a liability included in accrued liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities. The total liability\nassociated with phantom share units at March 31, 2023 is $3,158,126, with $2,147,652 of this amount included in current accrued\nliabilities and the remaining portion of $1,010,474 included in long-term accrued liabilities.\nThe impact associated with the fair value re-measurement of phantom share units is recorded in selling, general and administrative\nexpenses within the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.

Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company accrues estimates for resolution of any legal and other contingencies when losses are probable and reasonably\nestimable in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies (“ASC 450”). No less than quarterly, the Company reviews the status of\neach significant matter underlying a legal proceeding or claim and assess our potential financial exposure. The Company accrues a\nliability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any legal proceeding or claim is considered probable and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether\nthe amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable, and accruals are based only on the information available to the Company at\nthe time the judgment is made, which may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate or unanticipated events and circumstances may\noccur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, the outcome of legal proceedings is\ninherently uncertain, and we may incur substantial defense costs and expenses defending any of these matters.\nPage 20\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\nLegal Proceedings\nAs previously disclosed, the Company (through its subsidiary Sleep Management LLC) submitted a purchase order (the “Purchase\nOrder”) in March 2020 to Vyaire Medical, Inc. d/b/a CareFusion Respiratory Technologies (“Vyaire”) for respiratory equipment. The\nCompany ultimately prepaid $1.4 million towards the delivery of such respiratory equipment. Vyaire was unable or unwilling to\ndeliver the vast majority of the respiratory equipment referenced in the Purchase Order, and also refused to refund the prepayment\namount (less the amounts paid for equipment actually received). On July 29, 2020, the Company (through its subsidiary Sleep\nManagement LLC) filed a lawsuit against Vyaire in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana (the\n“Court”). This lawsuit was dismissed on December 8, 2020 in connection with the commencement of the lawsuit filed by the\nCompany (through its subsidiary Sleep Management) on November 5, 2020, against Vyaire in the 15th Judicial District Court for\nthe Parish of Lafayette, Louisiana (the “State Court”) seeking damages for breach of contract and seeking a declaratory judgment\nthat the Company is not required to pay any further funds to Vyaire. On December 28, 2020, Vyaire filed its Answer, Affirmative\nDefenses, and Reconventional Demand (“Reconventional Demand”) with the State Court alleging breach of contract and seeking\ndamages of $4.7 million purportedly for the improper cancellation of the Purchase Order. The Company filed its Answer to the\nReconventional Demand on February 12, 2021 and the parties are currently engaged in discovery. The Court has set a deadline to\ncomplete discovery of July 17, 2023, and has set a date for a non-jury trial on October 30, 2023.\nThe Company continues to believe that it has valid legal and equitable grounds to recover its outstanding prepayment as a result of\nVyaire’s failure to deliver the vast majority of the respiratory equipment referenced in the Purchase Order. The Company has\ndetermined that a loss related to the Reconventional Demand is not probable, and thus has not accrued a liability related to this\nclaim. Although a loss may be reasonably possible, the Company does not have sufficient information to determine the amount or\nrange of reasonably possible loss with respect to the Reconventional Demand given that the dispute is in the early stages of the\nlegal process. As of March 31, 2023, outstanding funds in the amount of $0.9 million related to undelivered respiratory equipment\nare included within other long-term assets.\nGovernmental and Regulatory Matters\nFrom time to time the Company is involved in various external governmental investigations, audits and reviews. Reviews, audits\nand investigations of this sort can lead to government actions, which can result in the recoupment of reimbursements, civil or\ncriminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way the Company conducts business, loss of\nlicensure or exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs.\nIn May of 2021, a final report and recommendation (“Report”) was issued by the OIG regarding an audit by OIG of claims relating to\n100 of the Company’s non-invasive ventilation at home (“NIVH”) patients. The OIG asserted that most of the sampled Medicare\nclaims submitted for the monthly rental of non-invasive ventilators did not comply with Medicare requirements. The Company firmly\nbelieved that the Report ignored each patient’s diagnosis and supporting documentation of that diagnosis from treating and\nprescribing physicians and applied clinical guidelines that were contrary to CMS’s accepted standard of care. In late June of 2021,\nthe Company received initial request letters from DME Medicare Administrative Contractors (\"MACs\") referencing the Report and\nrequesting repayment of purported overpayments. The Company responded to each initial request by submitting a rebuttal and by\nfiling a redetermination appeal as prescribed by the initial request letters and by statute. In September 2021, the MACs informed\nthe Company of unfavorable decisions with respect to the redetermination appeals. In November 2021, the Company filed\nReconsideration Appeals with CMS's designated Qualified Independent Contractor (\"QIC\"). Based on its review, the QIC\ndetermined that approximately 77% of the claims it reviewed were medically necessary and properly payable under Medicare rules\nand regulations, overturning OIG’s and the MACs' initial recommendations and determinations. As a result of the QIC's\nreconsideration findings, reduced and recalculated principal overpayment requests totaling $1.1 million were issued by the MACs.\nIn order to limit the assessment of interest during the appeals period, the Company remitted the associated funds to the MACs. In\nDecember 2022, an Administrative Law Judge overturned all of the remaining appealed claims and instructed the MACs to refund\nall funds previously remitted by the Company. Accordingly, the funds remitted to the MACs are recorded in Prepaid expenses and\nother assets at December 31, 2022 and were received during the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n9. Income Taxes\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $0.5 million, which includes a\ndiscrete tax benefit of $0.1 million associated with stock-based compensation arrangements. Excluding the impact of the discrete\ntax benefit, the effective rate for the three months ended March 31, 2023 is 28.4%. The effective rate differs from the amount\ncomputed by applying the statutory federal and state income tax rates to ordinary income before the provision for income taxes due\nto permanent non-deductible differences. The Company's effective tax rate is based on forecasted annual results which may\nfluctuate significantly through the rest of the year.\nPage 21\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\nAt March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no amounts recorded for uncertain tax positions and does not expect any material\nchanges in uncertain tax benefits during the next 12 months. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax\nmatters in income tax expense. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in various states. The\nCompany is generally not subject to examination by taxing authorities for years prior to 2019.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that the Company believes that these assets are more likely than not to\nbe realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future\nreversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent\noperations.\n10. Earnings Per Share\nIncome per common share is calculated using earnings for the year divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding\nduring the year. Using the treasury stock method, diluted income per share amounts are calculated giving effect to the potential\ndilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to issue common shares were exercised or converted to common shares by\nassuming the proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs are used to purchase common shares\nat the prevailing market rate.\nThe following reflects the earnings and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2023 2022\nNumerator - basic and diluted:\nNet income attributable to shareholders $ 1,517 $ 1,762\nDenominator:\nBasic weighted-average number of common shares 38,156,777 39,621,741\nDiluted weighted-average number of shares 40,016,693 40,363,456\nBasic earnings per share $ 0.04 $ 0.04\nDiluted earnings per share $ 0.04 $ 0.04\nDenominator calculation from basic to diluted:\nBasic weighted-average number of common shares 38,156,777 39,621,741\nStock options and other dilutive securities 1,859,916 741,715\nDiluted weighted-average number of shares 40,016,693 40,363,456\nAnti-dilutive shares excluded from the calculation consisted of dilutive employee stock options and RSUs that were de minimis in all\nperiods presented.\n11. Subsequent Events\nOn April 18, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\") to acquire 100%\nof the equity interests of Home Medical Products, Inc., a home medical equipment provider which operates throughout Tennessee\nand in Alabama and Mississippi.\nPage 22\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\nItem 2.

Some of the\ninformation in this discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Actual results\nand timing of events could differ from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the\nfollowing discussion and analysis.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements and information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the\nmeaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or \"forward-looking information\" as such term is defined in\napplicable Canadian securities legislation (collectively, \"forward-looking statements\"). Any statements other than statements of\nhistorical information, including those that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives,\nassumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking and may involve estimates,\nassumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-\nlooking statements. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly\nupdate or revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events\nor otherwise, except as required by applicable law.\nForward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance and reflect the expectations or beliefs of management\nregarding future events, and include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: operating results; profitability; financial\ncondition and resources; anticipated needs for working capital; liquidity; capital resources; capital expenditures; milestones;\nlicensing milestones; information with respect to future growth and growth strategies; anticipated trends in our industry; our future\nfinancing plans; timelines; currency fluctuations; government regulation; unanticipated expenses; commercial disputes or claims;\nlimitations on insurance coverage or other reimbursement; and availability of cash flow to fund capital requirements.\nOften, but not always, forward-looking information can be identified by the use of words such as “plans”, “expects”, “is expected”,\n“budget”, “potential”, “scheduled”, “estimates”, “forecasts”, “intends”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “projects”, or the negatives thereof or\nvariations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results “will”, “should”, “may”, “could”, “would”,\n“might” or “will be taken”, “occur” or “be achieved” or the negative of these terms or comparable terminology.\nForward-looking statements are based on the reasonable assumptions, estimates, analysis and opinions of management made in\nlight of its experience and its perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments, as well as other factors that\nmanagement believes to be relevant and reasonable in the circumstances at the date that such statements are made, but which\nmay prove to be incorrect. We believe that the assumptions and expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are\nreasonable. We cannot assure you, however, that such statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events\ncould differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-\nlooking statements.\nBy their nature, forward-looking statements involve numerous assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and\nspecific, including those identified under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the other\ndocuments we file with the SEC, including under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, and with the securities regulatory authorities in certain provinces of Canada, which contribute to the possibility\nthat the predicted outcomes may not occur or may be delayed. The risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are\nbeyond our control, that could influence actual results include, but are not limited to: the general business, market and economic\nconditions in the regions in which the we operate; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by governmental\nauthorities, individuals and companies in response to the pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations,\nincluding on our patient base, revenues, employees, and equipment and supplies; significant capital requirements and operating\nrisks that we may be subject to; our ability to implement business strategies and pursue business opportunities; volatility in the\nmarket price of our common shares; our novel business model; the state of the capital markets; the availability of funds and\nresources to pursue operations; reductions in reimbursement rates and audits of reimbursement claims by various governmental\nand private payor entities; dependence on few payors; possible new drug discoveries; dependence on key suppliers; granting of\npermits and licenses in a highly regulated business; competition; disruptions in or attacks (including cyber-attacks) on our\ninformation technology, internet, network access or other voice or data communications systems or services; the evolution of\nvarious types of fraud or other criminal behavior to which we are exposed; difficulty integrating newly acquired businesses; the\nimpact of new and changes to, or application of, current laws and regulations; the overall difficult litigation and regulatory\nPage 23\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\nenvironment; increased competition; increased funding costs and market volatility due to market illiquidity and competition for\nfunding; critical accounting estimates and changes to accounting standards, policies, and methods used by us; our status as an\nemerging growth company and a smaller reporting company; and the occurrence of natural and unnatural catastrophic events or\nhealth epidemics or concerns, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and claims resulting from such events or concerns, as well as\nother general economic, market and business conditions; and other factors beyond our control.\nGeneral Matters\nIn this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" and \"our\" refer\nto Viemed Healthcare, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nWe were incorporated on December 14, 2016 pursuant to the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia).

Our services include respiratory disease management (through the rental of various HME devices), neuromuscular\ncare, in-home sleep testing and sleep apnea treatment, oxygen therapy, and the sale of associated supplies.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue through the rental of non-invasive and invasive ventilators which represented 63.6% and\n71.3% of our traditional revenue, excluding COVID-19 response sales and services, for the three months ended March 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively. We combine the benefits of home ventilation support with licensed Respiratory Therapists (\"RTs\") to drive\nimproved patient outcomes and reduce costly hospital readmissions.\nWe expect to grow through expansion of existing service areas as well as in new territories through a cost efficient launch that\nreduces location expenses. We currently serve patients in all 50 states. We expect to continue to employ more RTs in order to\nassure our high service model is accomplished in the home. As of March 31, 2023, we employed 305 licensed RTs, representing\nmore than 40% of our company-wide employee count. By focusing overhead costs on personnel that service the patient rather than\nphysical location costs, we anticipate that we will efficiently scale our business in regions that are currently not being effectively\nserviced.\nThe continued trend of servicing patients in the home rather than in hospitals is aligned with our business objective and we\nanticipate that this trend will continue to offer growth opportunities for us. We expect to continue to be a solution to the rising health\ncosts in the United States by offering more cost effective, home based solutions while increasing the quality of life for patients\nfighting serious respiratory diseases.\nPage 24\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\nTrends Affecting our Business\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Various policies and initiatives\nwere implemented to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, the postponement of non-\nessential medical surgeries, limiting access to medical facilities, and adoption of social distancing and remote working policies.\nEmployee and patient safety is our first priority, and as a result, we put preparedness plans in place for our employees, especially\nour clinical personnel, and modified our clinical protocols to limit unnecessary patient encounters. On January 30, 2023, the U.S.\ngovernment announced that it plans to end the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (\"COVID-19 PHE\") on May 11, 2023. The U.S.\nFood and Drug Administration has announced in the Federal Register that the Emergency Use Authorization for certain ventilators\nand PAP and RAD devices will be in effect until November 7, 2023, 180 days beyond the end of the COVID-19 PHE. At the end of\nthe COVID-19 PHE, many waivers and flexibilities available during the COVID-19 pandemic will become unavailable.\nWhile COVID-19 related measures have not had a material impact on our consolidated operating results for the three months\nended March 31, 2023, we cannot predict at this time the impact that the end of the COVID-19 PHE will have on our business and\nfinancial condition. It is also possible that the U.S. government will ultimately decide not to end the COVID-19 PHE on May 11,\n2023, creating additional uncertainties about our future business and financial condition. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that\ndemand for our products and services will continue or that we will be able to maintain operations necessary to satisfy such\ndemand, including sufficient personnel, supply chains and distributions channels.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant disruptions and volatility in capital and financial markets. Broad economic factors\nresulting from the current COVID-19 pandemic, including high unemployment and underemployment levels and reduced consumer\nspending and confidence, could also affect our service mix, revenue mix, payor mix and patient base, as well as our ability to\ncollect outstanding receivables. Business closures and layoffs in the geographic areas in which we operate may lead to increases\nin the uninsured and under-insured populations and adversely affect demand for our services, as well as the ability of patients and\nother payors to pay for services rendered. Any increase in the amount or deterioration in the collectability of patient accounts\nreceivable will adversely affect our financial results and require an increased level of working capital. In addition, we may\nexperience supply chain disruptions, including delays and price increases in equipment and supplies. Staffing, equipment and\nsupplies shortages may also impact our ability to assess potential patients in hospitals and set up and treat patients in the home. If\nCOVID-19 intensifies or if the response to contain the COVID-19 pandemic is unsuccessful, we could experience a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For additional information, see Part II - Item 1A. “Risk\nFactors.”\nThe CARES Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, provides a substantial stimulus and assistance package intended\nto address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including tax relief and government loans, grants and investments. We are\ncontinuing to monitor any effects or requirements that may result from the CARES Act as many of the provisions in the CARES Act\nare temporary and may require us to modify our operations and compliance procedures. CMS and other federal agencies have and\nare likely to issue rules and regulations to implement the CARES Act. The impact of these rules and regulations are unknown and\nmay affect us. To the extent these provisions will expire as stated in the CARES Act, we will be required to unwind any changes.\nIn 2019, CMS announced the inclusion of non-invasive ventilator products on the list of products subject to the competitive bidding\nprogram in Round 2021 which covers the period of January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2023. On March 9, 2020, CMS\nannounced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States President’s exercise of the Defense Production Act, public\nconcern regarding access to ventilators, and the non-invasive ventilators product category being new to the competitive bidding\nprogram, non-invasive ventilators were removed as a product category from Round 2021. On October 27, 2020, CMS announced\nthat it had removed 13 of the 15 remaining product categories from Round 2021, including oxygen and PAP devices, because the\npayment amounts did not achieve expected savings. As a result of these announcements, we retain the ability to continue to\nfurnish non-invasive ventilators and oxygen and PAP devices for all of our Medicare accredited areas, however, we are uncertain if\nnon-invasive ventilators, oxygen, and PAP devices will be included in future competitive bidding programs. The current Round 2021\ncontracts expire on December 31, 2023 and CMS has not announced a new round of competitive bidding. Historically, CMS\nannounces new rounds of competitive bidding and starts the process approximately 18 months prior to the contract start date.\nThe CARES Act introduced a new blended rate for HME furnished in non-rural or contiguous non-competitive bidding areas that is\nbased on 75% of the adjusted fee schedule amount and 25% of the unadjusted fee schedule amount. The Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, 2023 further extended the 75/25 blended Medicare reimbursement rate in non-competitive bidding/non-rural\nareas through the end of the COVID-19 PHE or December 31, 2023, whichever is later, after which it will revert to 100% of the\nMedicare fee schedule.\nPage 25\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe CARES Act also provided for a temporary suspension of the 2% payment sequestration adjustment currently applied to all\nMedicare fee-for-service claims. In December 2021, President Biden signed into law legislation that extended the suspension on\nthe 2 percent payment sequestration through March 31, 2022. The payment sequestration adjustment was fixed at 1 percent from\nApril 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022 and it returned to 2 percent on July 1, 2022.\nThe Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (\"PAYGO\") required that automatic payment cuts of 4% be put into place if a statutory\naction is projected to create a net increase in the deficit over either five or 10 years. The enactment of the American Rescue Plan\nAct in 2021 would have triggered PAYGO sequestration in 2021. In the Protecting Medicare & American Farmers from Sequester\nCuts Act, Congress delayed the PAYGO sequestration until January 1, 2023. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 further\nprevented implementation of the PAYGO Medicare 4% sequester through the end of 2024. If not renewed, the PAYGO payment\nadjustment could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn its 2023 DMEPOS Fee Schedule, CMS also announced the fee schedule adjustment based on the annual change to the\nConsumer Pricing Index for all urban areas. Items that were subject to the competitive bidding program in former competitive\nbidding areas will receive a 6.4% reimbursement rate increase. Items that were subject to the competitive bidding program in non-\ncompetitive bidding areas will receive a 9.1% reimbursement rate increase. Items not subject to the competitive bidding program\nwill receive an 8.7% reimbursement rate increase.\nWhile we cannot predict what Medicare payment rates or coverage determinations will be in effect in future years, changes to\npayment rates or benefit coverages may materially impact its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe below table highlights summary financial and operational metrics for the last eight quarters.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except vent patients)\nMarch 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30,\nFor the quarter ended 2023 2022 2022 2022 2022 2021 2021 2021\nFinancial Information:\nRevenue $ 39,556 $ 37,508 $ 35,759 $ 33,310 $ 32,255 $ 31,962 $ 29,285 $ 27,399\nGross Profit 24,004 22,896 21,651 20,390 19,743 19,662 18,381 17,625\nGross Profit % 61 % 61 % 61 % 61 % 61 % 62 % 63 % 64 %\nNet Income 1,517 2,438 1,055 967 1,762 4,087 1,789 1,566\nCash (As of) 23,544 16,914 21,478 21,922 29,248 28,408 26,867 31,151\nTotal Assets (As of) 124,634 117,043 119,419 115,904 119,007 117,962 115,486 111,014\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) 8,328 9,306 6,982 6,458 7,273 9,549 7,419 6,847\nOperational Information:\nVent Patients(2) 9,337 9,306 9,127 8,837 8,434 8,405 8,200 8,103\n(1) Refer to \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section below for definition of Adjusted EBITDA.\n(2) Vent Patients represents the number of active ventilator patients on recurring billing service at the end of each calendar quarter.\nPage 26\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 and 2022:\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n% of Total % of Total $ %\n2023 Revenue 2022 Revenue Change Change\nRevenue $ 39,556 100.0 % $ 32,255 100.0 % $ 7,301 22.6 %\nCost of revenue 15,552 39.3 % 12,512 38.8 % 3,040 24.3 %\nGross profit 24,004 60.7 % 19,743 61.2 % 4,261 21.6 %\nSelling, general and administrative 19,762 50.0 % 15,776 48.9 % 3,986 25.3 %\nResearch and development 780 2.0 % 632 2.0 % 148 23.4 %\nStock-based compensation 1,391 3.5 % 1,305 4.0 % 86 6.6 %\nDepreciation 240 0.6 % 237 0.7 % 3 1.3 %\nGain on disposal of property and equipment (22) (0.1) % (14) (0.1) % (8) 57.1 %\nOther income (81) (0.2) % (441) (1.4) % 360 (81.6) %\nIncome from operations 1,934 4.9 % 2,248 7.0 % (314) (14.0) %\nNon-operating income and expenses\nIncome from equity method investments (35) (0.1) % (323) (1.0) % 288 (89.2) %\nInterest (income) expense (49) (0.1) % 64 0.2 % (113) (176.6) %\nNet income before taxes 2,018 5.1 % 2,507 7.8 % (489) (19.5) %\nProvision for income taxes 501 1.3 % 745 2.3 % (244) (32.8) %\nNet income $ 1,517 3.8 % $ 1,762 5.5 % $ (245) (13.9) %\nRevenue\nThe following table summarizes our revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n% of Total % of Total $ %\n2023 Revenue 2022 Revenue Change Change\nNet revenue from rentals\nVentilator rentals, non-invasive and invasive $ 25,147 63.6 % $ 21,518 66.7 % $ 3,629 16.9 %\nOther durable medical equipment rentals 6,906 17.5 % 4,359 13.5 % 2,547 58.4 %\nNet revenue from sales and services\nEquipment and supply sales 4,764 12.0 % 3,037 9.4 % 1,727 56.9 %\nCOVID-19 response sales and services — — % 2,095 6.5 % (2,095) (100.0) %\nService revenues 2,739 6.9 % 1,246 3.9 % 1,493 119.8 %\nTotal net revenue $ 39,556 100.0 % $ 32,255 100.0 % $ 7,301 22.6 %\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, revenue totaled $39.6 million, an increase of $7.3 million (or 22.6%) from the\ncomparable period in 2022. Excluding COVID-19 response sales and services revenue, net revenue increased $9.4 million (or\n31.2%) from the comparable period in 2022. The net revenue growth was driven by an increase in ventilator rental revenue of $3.6\nmillion (or 16.9%) due to our organic growth in active ventilator patient base. In addition to the ventilator rental revenue growth, net\nrevenue growth was also driven by an increase in rental revenue from other DME of $2.5 million (or 58.4%), consisting of rental\nrevenue from continued national expansion of PAP, oxygen therapy, and percussion vest activities. Equipment and supply sales\nincreased by $1.7 million (or 56.9%), primarily driven by the success of our PAP resupply program and other sleep offerings.\nService revenues increased by $1.5 million (or 119.8%) primarily due to the growth of healthcare staffing services. While ventilator\nrentals continue to make up the majority of our revenue, the growth of PAP and oxygen related sales and services, as well as our\nhealthcare staffing offerings, is contributing significantly to the diversity of our overall revenue mix.\nPage 27\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\nThere were no COVID-19 response sales and services during the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $2.1 million\nduring the three months ended March 31, 2022. The magnitude and persistence of future COVID-19 response sales and services\nrevenue remains uncertain and is dependent on the intensity and length of the COVID-19 pandemic and the demand for ongoing\nservices from primarily governmental customers.\nCost of revenue and gross profit\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, cost of revenue totaled $15.6 million, an increase of $3.0 million (or 24.3%) from the\ncomparable period in 2022. Overall gross profit percentage decreased from approximately 61.2% in the three months ended March\n31, 2022 to approximately 60.7% in the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in gross profit percentage is primarily\ndue to migration of the revenue mix associated with product and service diversification. As a result of subsiding inflationary cost\npressures and the positive effects of seasonality in collection rates, gross profit percentage for our normal operations is expected to\nincrease through the end of 2023, partially offset by the impacts of continued product and service diversification.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $19.8 million, an increase of $4.0\nmillion (or 25.3%) from the comparable prior period. Excluding COVID-19 related revenues, selling, general and administrative\nexpenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 50.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to 52.3% for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2022.\nThe increase in overall selling, general and administrative expense as compared to the prior period is primarily due to additional\nemployee related expenses to accommodate the overall growth of the Company. Our full time employee count increased from 662\non March 31, 2022 to 765 on March 31, 2023, an increase of 15.6%. Employee compensation expenses increased $3.6 million (or\n33.0%) as a result of higher compensation expense associated with an overall increase in our employee headcount and increases\nin incentive and volume based compensation. Also included in the employee compensation expense increases was a $0.7 million\nincrease related to the impact of our phantom stock plan. Our phantom stock plan is measured at fair value as of the end of the\nreporting period and is driven primarily by the number of eligible employees and our stock price. During the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2023, our stock price increased by 27.7% compared to a decrease of 4.5% for the prior comparable period. We expect\nthat current year selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will improve through the end of 2023 as\ncosts stabilize relative to revenue growth.\nResearch and development\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, research and development expense totaled $0.8 million, an increase of $0.1 million\n(or 23.4%) from the comparable period in 2022. As we continue to invest in research and development related projects to support\nour technology initiatives, we expect that the associated costs will remain consistent in 2023 relative to 2022 costs.\nStock-based compensation\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, stock-based compensation totaled $1.4 million, an increase of 6.6% from the\ncomparable period in 2022. We expect that as we continue to increase our employee count and utilize stock-based awards as an\naspect of employee compensation, stock-based compensation expense will increase accordingly. Revenue growth has historically\nexceeded the growth in stock-based compensation and stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue is expected to\ncontinue to decline.\nProvision for income taxes\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, the provision for income taxes was $0.5 million, compared to a $0.7 million during the\ncomparable 2022 period. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to the impact of discrete tax benefits associated\nwith stock-based compensation between periods. Excluding discrete items, our annual estimated effective tax rate for 2023 is\n28.4%.\nNet income\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, net income was $1.5 million, a decrease of $0.2 million (or 13.9%) from the\ncomparable period in 2022. Net income as a percentage of net revenue decreased from 5.5% for the three months ended March\n31, 2022 to 3.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to the benefits of COVID-19 related activities and\nProvider Relief Fund income in the three months ended March 31, 2022.\nPage 28\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company uses Adjusted EBITDA, which is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") to analyze its financial results and believes that it is useful to investors, as a\nsupplement to U.S. GAAP measures. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information with respect to the\nCompany’s operating performance as viewed by management, including a view of the Company’s business that is not dependent\non the impact of the Company’s capitalization structure and items that are not part of the Company’s day-to-day operations.\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA (i) to compare the Company’s operating performance on a consistent basis, (ii) to calculate\nincentive compensation for the Company’s employees, (iii) for planning purposes, including the preparation of the Company’s\ninternal annual operating budget, and (iv) to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the Company’s operational strategies.\nAccordingly, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in understanding and evaluating the\nCompany’s operating performance in the same manner as management. In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, certain items (mostly\nnon-cash) are excluded from net income including interest, taxes, stock based compensation, and depreciation of property and\nequipment. Beginning with financial results reported for periods in fiscal year 2023, Adjusted EBITDA also excludes transaction\ncosts and expenses related to acquisition and integration efforts associated with recently announced or completed acquisitions.\nThis modification enables investors to compare period-over-period results on a more consistent basis without the effects of\nacquisitions. We have recast Adjusted EBITDA for prior periods when reported to conform to the modified presentation.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of Net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, on a\nhistorical basis for the periods indicated:\nMarch 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30,\nFor the quarter ended 2023 2022 2022 2022 2022 2021 2021 2021\nNet Income $ 1,517 $ 2,438 $ 1,055 $ 967 $ 1,762 $ 4,087 $ 1,789 $ 1,566\nAdd back:\nDepreciation 4,762 4,373 4,120 3,740 3,397 3,120 2,867 2,716\nInterest (income) expense (49) 32 42 59 64 69 75 83\nStock-based compensation(a) 1,391 1,317 1,309 1,271 1,305 1,305 1,302 1,236\nTransaction costs(b) 206 — — — — — — —\nIncome tax expense 501 1,146 456 421 745 968 1,386 1,246\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 8,328 $ 9,306 $ 6,982 $ 6,458 $ 7,273 $ 9,549 $ 7,419 $ 6,847\n(a) Represents non-cash, equity-based compensation expense associated with option and RSU awards.\n(b) Represents transaction costs and expenses related to acquisition and integration efforts associated with recently announced or\ncompleted acquisitions.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in\naccordance with GAAP. It is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an\nalternative to revenue or net income, as applicable, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an\nalternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of the Company's liquidity, and may not be comparable to other\nsimilarly titled measures of other companies or businesses. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not\nbe considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA does\nnot reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of ongoing operations; and\nother companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative\nmeasure.\nPage 29\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2023 was $23.5 million, compared to $16.9 million at December 31, 2022.

During the three months\nended March 31, 2022, the Company repurchased and canceled 389,878 common shares at a cost of $1.9 million pursuant to the\nShare Repurchase Program authorized by the Board of Directors on March 7, 2022 (the \"2022 Share Repurchase Program\"). The\nCompany also acquired and cancelled 23,742 common shares at a cost of $0.1 million to satisfy employee income tax withholding\nassociated with RSUs vesting during the three months ended March 31, 2022. Net cash used in financing activities during the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2022 also included $0.4 million in principal payments on the Term Note (as defined below).\nSenior Credit Facilities\nOn November 29, 2022, the Company refinanced its existing borrowings under the prior Commercial Business Loan Agreement\nwith Hancock Whitney Bank and entered into a new credit agreement (the \"2022 Senior Credit Facilities\") with the lenders from\ntime to time party thereto, and Regions Bank, as administrative agent and collateral agent, that provides for an up to $30.0 million\nrevolving credit facility (the \"2022 Revolving Credit Facility\") and an up to $30.0 million delayed draw term loan facility (the \"2022\nTerm Loan Facility\"), both maturing in November 2027.\nThe proceeds of the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility may be used to refinance existing indebtedness, for working capital purposes,\ncapital expenditures and other general corporate purposes (including permitted acquisitions), and to pay transaction fees, costs\nand expenses related to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities. The proceeds of the 2022 Term Loan Facility and any additional term\nloans established in accordance with the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities may be used to finance permitted acquisitions and to pay\ntransaction fees, costs and expenses related to such acquisitions. There were no outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Senior\nCredit Facilities at March 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are Term SOFR (as defined in the 2022 Senior Credit\nFacilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 2.625% to 3.375%, or, at the option of the Company, a Base Rate (as\ndefined in the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 1.625% to 2.375%.\nThe 2022 Senior Credit Facilities require the Company to comply with certain affirmative, as well as certain negative covenants\nthat, among other things, will restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur indebtedness, grant liens,\nmake investments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations and pay dividends and other restricted payments. The 2022\nSenior Credit Facilities also include certain financial covenants, which generally include, but are not limited to the following:\n• Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (defined generally as total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than (i) for\nany fiscal quarter ending during the period from the closing date to and including December 31, 2024, 2.75 to 1.0 and (ii)\nfor any fiscal quarter ending on and after March 31, 2025, 2.50 to 1.0, subject to certain adjustments following a material\nacquisition.\n• Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (defined generally as (a) adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditures minus\ncash taxes to (b) the sum of scheduled principal payments plus cash interest expense plus restricted payments) of not\nless than 1.25:1.0.\nThe Company was in compliance with all covenants under the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities in effect at March 31, 2023.\nPage 31\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\nUse of Funds\nOur principal uses of cash are funding our new rental assets and other capital purchases, operations, and other working capital\nrequirements. The following table presents our material contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments as of\nMarch 31, 2023:\nWithin 12 Months Beyond 12 Months\nLease Obligations $ 397 $ 162\nExcept for the funding of potential acquisitions and investments, we anticipate that our operating cash flows will satisfy our material\ncash requirements for the 12 months after March 31, 2023. In addition to our operating cash flows, we may need to raise additional\nfunds to support our contractual obligations and investing activities beyond such 12 month period, and such funding may not be\navailable to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, our operations and ability to\nexecute our business strategy could be adversely affected. We may seek to raise additional funds through equity, equity-linked or\ndebt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness would have rights that are\nsenior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. Any additional equity financing\nmay be dilutive to our stockholders.\nRetirement Plan\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) retirement plan for employees to which eligible employees can contribute a percentage of their\npre-tax compensation. Matching employer contributions to the 401(k) plan totaled $409,000 and $271,000 for the three months\nended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOff balance sheet arrangements\nThe Company has no material undisclosed off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or\nfuture effect on its results of operations or financial condition.\nAccounting and Disclosure Matters\nCritical Accounting Principles and Estimates\nWe are required to disclose “critical accounting estimates” which are estimates made in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and that have had or are reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe follow financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States. The more significant of these policies are summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in\nPart II, Item 8 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Not all significant accounting\npolicies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments. However, the policy noted below could be deemed\nto meet the SEC’s definition of a critical accounting estimate.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company estimates that a certain portion of receivables from customers may not be collected and maintains an allowance for\ndoubtful accounts. The Company evaluates the net realizable value of accounts receivable as of the date of Consolidated Balance\nSheets. Specifically, we consider historical realization data, including current and historical cash collections, accounts receivable\naging trends, other operating trends and relevant business conditions. Because of continuing changes in the healthcare industry\nand third-party reimbursement, it is possible that the estimates could change, which could have a material impact on the operations\nand cash flows. If circumstances related to certain customers change or actual results differ from expectations, our estimate of the\nrecoverability of receivables could fluctuate from that provided for in our consolidated financial statements. A change in estimate\ncould impact bad debt expense and accounts receivable. The continued volatility in market conditions and evolving shifts in credit\ntrends are difficult to predict causing variability and volatility that may have a material impact on our allowance for doubtful\naccounts in future periods. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $11.0 million and $8.5 million as of March 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, and based on our analysis, we believe the reserve is adequate for any exposure to credit losses.\nPage 32\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of US Dollars, except per share amounts)\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of\nrecently issued accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of\noperations, financial positions and cash flows.\nPage 33\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nNot Applicable.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to\nRule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded:\ni. that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure (a) that information required to be\ndisclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized\nand reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and (b) that such information is accumulated\nand communicated to the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as\nappropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure; and\nii. that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that the Company's disclosures controls and procedures will detect or\nuncover all failures of persons within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries to disclose material information otherwise\nrequired to be set forth in the Company's periodic reports. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of\ndisclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and\nprocedures.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended March 31,\n2023 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial\nreporting.\nPage 34\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to various ongoing or threatened legal actions and other proceedings, including those that\narise in the ordinary course of business, which may include employment matters, breach of contract disputes, as well as\ngovernmental and regulatory matters. Please read Note 8—Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements for more information. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and to outcomes that are not predictable\nwith assurance and that may not be known for extended periods of time.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors\ndiscussed in “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on March\n3, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no material changes in\nour risk factors from those disclosed in that Annual Report.\nItem 2.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES\nThis management information and proxy circular (the “Circular”) and accompanying form of proxy are furnished in\nconnection with the solicitation, by management of Viemed Healthcare, Inc. (the “Corporation”), of proxies to be used at\nthe annual general and special meeting of the holders (the “Shareholders”) of common shares (“Common Shares”) of the\nCorporation (the “Meeting”) referred to in the accompanying Notice of Meeting (the “Notice of Meeting”) to be held on\nJune 6, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. (CDT) at the principal executive offices of the Corporation, located at 625 E. Kaliste Saloom\nRoad, Lafayette, Louisiana 70508. The solicitation will be made primarily by mail, subject to the use of Notice-and-Access\nProvisions (as defined below) in relation to delivery of the Meeting materials, but proxies may also be solicited personally or by\ntelephone by directors and/or officers of the Corporation, or by the Corporation’s transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services\nInc. (“Computershare”), at nominal cost. The cost of solicitation by management will be borne by the Corporation. Pursuant to\nNational Instrument 54-101 – Communication with Beneficial Owners of Securities of a Reporting Issuer (“NI 54-101”),\narrangements have been made with clearing agencies, brokerage houses and other financial intermediaries to forward proxy\nsolicitation material to the beneficial owners of the Common Shares. The cost of any such solicitation will be borne by the\nCorporation.\nAll references to currency in this Circular are in United States dollars, unless otherwise indicated. References to “USD” refer to\nUnited States dollars and references to “CAD” refer to Canadian dollars.\n2. NOTICE-AND-ACCESS\nThe Corporation is sending out proxy-related materials to Shareholders using the notice-and-access provisions under rules\nadopted by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) as permitted pursuant to National Instrument\n51-102 – Continuous Disclosure Obligations (“NI 51-102”) and NI 54-101 (collectively, the “Notice-and-Access Provisions”).\nThe Corporation anticipates that use of the Notice-and-Access Provisions will benefit the Corporation by reducing the postage and\nmaterial costs associated with the printing and mailing of the proxy-related materials and will additionally reduce the\nenvironmental impact of such actions.\nShareholders will be provided with electronic access to the Notice of Meeting and this Circular on the Corporation’s website at\nwww.viemed.com/investors. They can also be found on the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system\n(“EDGAR”) at www.sec.gov/edgar and the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (“SEDAR+”) at\nwww.sedarplus.ca.\nShareholders are reminded to review the Circular before voting. On or about April 26, 2024, we will begin mailing to\nShareholders paper copies of a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials containing information prescribed by the\nNotice-and-Access Provisions, including instructions on how to access and review proxy materials as well as directions on how to\nvote by proxy. The Corporation will not use procedures known as ‘stratification’ in relation to the use of Notice-and-Access\nProvisions. Stratification occurs when an issuer using Notice-and-Access Provisions sends a paper copy of the Circular to some\nsecurityholders with a notice package.\nShareholders with questions about notice-and-access can call the Corporation toll-free at 1-866-852-8343. Shareholders may\nobtain paper copies of the Circular free of charge by calling 1-͏866-852-8343 at any time up until and including the date of the\nMeeting, including any adjournment or postponement thereof. Any Shareholder wishing to obtain a paper copy of the Meeting\nmaterials should submit its request no later than 12:00 p.m. (ET) on May 23, 2024 in order to receive paper copies of the Meeting\nmaterials in time to vote before the Meeting. Under the Notice-and-Access Provisions, Meeting materials will be available for\nviewing on the Corporation’s website for one year from the date of posting.\nPage 7\n3. RECORD DATE\nShareholders of record at the close of business on April 12, 2024 (the “Record Date”) are entitled to receive notice of and attend\nthe Meeting in person or by proxy and are entitled to one vote for each Common Share registered in the name of such Shareholder\nin respect of each matter to be voted upon at the Meeting.\n4. APPOINTMENT OF PROXIES\nThe persons named in the enclosed form of proxy are directors and/or officers of the Corporation. Each Shareholder submitting a\nproxy has the right to appoint a person or company (who need not be a Shareholder), other than the persons named in the enclosed\nform of proxy, to represent such Shareholder at the Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. Such right may be\nexercised by inserting the name of such representative in the blank space provided in the enclosed form of proxy. All proxies must\nbe executed by the Shareholder or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing or, if the Shareholder is a corporation, by an\nofficer or attorney thereof duly authorized.\nA proxy will not be valid for the Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof unless it is completed and delivered to\nComputershare before 9:00 a.m. (CDT) on June 4, 2024, or no later than 48 hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays)\nbefore any adjournment or postponement of the Meeting in accordance with the delivery instructions below or delivered to the\nchairman (the “Chairman”) of the board of directors of the Corporation (the “Board”) on the day of the Meeting, prior to the\ncommencement of the Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. The time limit for deposit of proxies may be waived\nor extended by the Chairman of the Meeting at his discretion, without notice.\nA registered Shareholder may submit his/her/its proxy by mail, by telephone or over the Internet in accordance with the\ninstructions below. A non-registered Shareholder should follow the instructions included on the voting instruction form provided\nby his or her Intermediary (as defined below).\nVoting Instructions for Registered Holders\nA registered Shareholder may submit a proxy by (i) mailing a copy to Computershare Investor Services Inc., Attention: Proxy\nDepartment, 8th Floor, 100 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario M5J 2Y1, (ii) telephone by entering the 15 digit control number\n(as found on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials) at 1-866-732-8683 (Canada and the U.S. only) or (312)\n588-4290 (outside Canada and the U.S.), or (iii) online by entering the 15 digit control number (as found on the Notice of Internet\nAvailability of Proxy Materials) at www.investorvote.com before 9:00 a.m. (CDT) on June 4, 2024, or no later than 48 hours\n(excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) before any adjournment or postponement of the Meeting.\n5. REVOCATION OF PROXIES\nProxies given by Shareholders for use at the Meeting may be revoked at any time prior to their use. Subject to compliance with\nthe requirements described in the following paragraph, the giving of a proxy will not affect the right of a Shareholder to attend,\nand vote in person at, the Meeting.\nIn addition to revocation in any other manner permitted by law, a proxy may be revoked by instrument in writing executed by the\nShareholder or his/her attorney duly authorized in writing, or, if the Shareholder is a corporation, under its corporate seal by an\nofficer or attorney thereof duly authorized and deposited with Computershare, in a manner provided above under “Appointment\nof Proxies”, at any time up to and including ͏9:00 a.m. (CDT) ͏on June 4, 2024 (or, if the Meeting is adjourned or postponed, 48\nhours (Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excepted) prior to the holding of the Meeting) or, with the Chairman at the Meeting on\nthe day of such meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, and upon any such deposit, the proxy is revoked.\n6. NON-REGISTERED HOLDERS\nOnly registered Shareholders, or the persons they appoint as their proxies, are permitted to attend and vote at the Meeting.\nHowever, in many cases, Common Shares beneficially owned by a non-registered Shareholder (a “Non-Registered Holder”) are\nregistered either (i) in the name of an intermediary (each, an “Intermediary” and collectively, the “Intermediaries”) that the\nNon-Registered Holder deals with in respect of the Common Shares, such as, among others, banks, trust companies, securities\ndealers or brokers and trustees or administrators of self-administered registered savings plans, registered retirement income funds,\nregistered education savings plans and similar plans, or (ii) in the name of a clearing agency (such as the Depository Trust\nCompany or CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc.) of which the Intermediary is a participant.\nPage 8\nIn accordance with applicable laws, Non-Registered Holders who have advised their Intermediary that they do not object to the\nIntermediary providing their ownership information to issuers whose securities they beneficially own (“Non-Objecting\nBeneficial Owners,” or “NOBOs”) will receive by mail a letter with respect to the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy\nMaterials. This Circular and the Notice of Meeting may be found at and downloaded from www.viemed.com/investors.\nNOBOs who have standing instructions with the Intermediary for physical copies of this Circular will receive by mail the Notice\nof Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, this Circular and the Notice of Meeting.\nIntermediaries are required to forward the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to Non-Registered Holders who have\nadvised their Intermediary that they object to the Intermediary providing their ownership information (“Objecting Beneficial\nOwners,” or “OBOs”) unless a Non-Registered Holder has waived the right to receive them. Intermediaries will generally use\nservice companies (such as Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.) to forward proxy-related materials to OBOs. Generally, OBOs\nwho have not waived the right to receive proxy-related materials will either:\na) be given a form of proxy which has already been signed by the Intermediary (typically by a facsimile stamped signature),\nwhich is restricted as to the number and class of securities beneficially owned by the OBO but which is not otherwise\ncompleted. Because the Intermediary has already signed the form of proxy, this form of proxy is not required to be\nsigned by the Non-Registered Holder when submitting the proxy. In this case, the OBO who wishes to vote by proxy\nshould otherwise properly complete the form of proxy and deliver it as specified; or\nb) be given a Voting Instruction Form which the Intermediary must follow. The OBO should properly complete and sign the\nVoting Instruction Form and submit it to the Intermediary or its service company in accordance with the instructions of\nthe Intermediary or its service company.\nIn either case, the purpose of this procedure is to permit Non-Registered Holders to direct the voting of the Common Shares they\nbeneficially own. Should a Non-Registered Holder who receives either form of proxy wish to vote in person at the Meeting if a\nballot is called, the Non-Registered Holder should strike out the persons named in the form of proxy and insert the Non-\nRegistered Holder's name in the blank space provided. Non-Registered Holders should carefully follow the instructions of their\nIntermediary including those regarding when and where the form of proxy or Voting Instruction Form is to be delivered.\nManagement of the Corporation does not intend to pay for Intermediaries to forward the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy\nMaterials to OBOs. An OBO will not receive the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials unless the Intermediary\nassumes the cost of delivery.\n7. EXERCISE OF DISCRETION BY PROXIES\nCommon Shares represented by properly executed proxies in favor of the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy will be\nvoted on any ballot that may be called for and, where the person whose proxy is solicited specifies a choice with respect to the\nmatters identified in the proxy, the Common Shares will be voted or withheld from voting in accordance with the specifications so\nmade. Where Shareholders have properly executed proxies in favor of the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy and have\nnot specified in the form of proxy the manner in which the named proxies are required to vote the Common Shares represented\nthereby, such shares will be voted in favor of the passing of the matters set forth in the Notice of Meeting. If a Shareholder\nappoints a representative other than the persons designated in the form of proxy, the Corporation assumes no responsibility as to\nwhether the representative so appointed will attend the Meeting on the day thereof or any adjournment or postponement thereof.\nThe enclosed form of proxy confers discretionary authority with respect to amendments or variations to the matters identified in\nthe Notice of Meeting and with respect to other matters that may properly come before the Meeting. At the date hereof, the\nmanagement of the Corporation and the directors of the Corporation know of no such amendments, variations or other matters to\ncome before the Meeting. However, if any other matters which at present are not known to the management of the Corporation\nand the directors of the Corporation should properly come before the Meeting, the proxy will be voted on such matters in\naccordance with the best judgment of the named proxies.\nPage 9\n8. INTEREST OF CERTAIN PERSONS OR COMPANIES IN MATTERS TO BE ACTED UPON\nExcept as described elsewhere in this Circular, management of the Corporation is not aware of any material interest, direct or\nindirect, by way of beneficial ownership of securities or otherwise, of (a) any director or executive officer of the Corporation, (b)\nany proposed nominee for election as a director of the Corporation, and (c) any associates or affiliates of any of the persons or\ncompanies listed in (a) and (b), in any matter to be acted on at the Meeting.\n9. VOTING SECURITIES AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS\nAs at the Record Date, the Corporation had 38,820,766 Common Shares outstanding, representing the Corporation’s only\nsecurities with respect to which a voting right may be exercised at the Meeting. Each Common Share carries the right to one vote\nat the Meeting. A quorum for the transaction of business at the Meeting is one or more shareholders, or one or more proxyholders\nrepresenting one or more shareholders, present at the Meeting, holding or representing not less than thirty three and one- third\npercent (33 1/3%) of the issued and outstanding Common Shares enjoying voting rights at the Meeting. Brokers and other\nintermediaries, holding Common Shares in street name for their customers, are required to vote the shares in the manner directed\nby their customers. Under the rules that govern brokers who are voting with respect to Common Shares that are held in street\nname, brokers have discretion to vote such shares on routine matters, but are prohibited from giving proxies to vote on non-\nroutine matters (including, but not limited to, the election of directors and the ordinary resolution to ratify, confirm and approve\nthe 2024 Long Term Incentive Plan) unless the beneficial owner of such Common Shares has given voting instructions on the\nmatter. The absence of a vote on a matter where the broker has not received written voting instructions from a beneficial owner is\nreferred to as a “broker non-vote.” Any Common Shares represented at the Meeting but not voted (whether by broker non-vote or\notherwise) will have no impact on the outcome of any matters to be acted upon at the Meeting, though Common Shares subject to\nabstentions or broker non-votes still count towards the quorum requirements for the Meeting.\nOther than as disclosed under “Principal Shareholders” below, to the knowledge of the directors and senior officers of the\nCorporation as at the date hereof, based on information provided on the System for Electronic Disclosure by Insiders (SEDI) and\non information filed by third parties on SEDAR+, no person beneficially owns or exercises control or direction over securities\ncarrying more than 10% of the voting rights attached to any class of outstanding voting securities of the Corporation entitled to be\nvoted at the Meeting.\nPage 10\nDirectors and Executive Officers\nThe following table shows the number of our Common Shares beneficially owned as of April 12, 2024, by each director or\ndirector nominee, the executive officers named in the “Summary Compensation Table” and all directors and executive officers as\na group.

BUSINESS OF THE MEETING\nTo the knowledge of the Board, the only matters to be brought before the Meeting are as follows:\n(i) Financial Statements\nPursuant to the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the “BCBCA”), the Board will place before the shareholders at the\nMeeting the audited consolidated financial statements of the Corporation, together with the auditors’ report thereon, for the fiscal\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Shareholder approval is not required in relation to the financial statements.\n(ii) Election of Directors\nThe Board presently consists of eight directors. All of the current directors have been directors since the dates indicated below and\nall will be standing for re-election. The Board has the authority to set the number of directors, such number presently being fixed\nat eight.\nThe Board recommends a vote “FOR” the election of each of the eight nominees listed below for director.\nEach director will hold office until their re-election or replacement at the next annual meeting of the shareholders unless they\nresign their duties or their office becomes vacant following death, dismissal or any other cause prior to such meeting.\nDirectors are elected by a plurality, and the eight nominees who receive the most “FOR” votes will be elected, subject to the\nCorporation’s majority voting policy (discussed below). Broker non-votes and abstentions are not relevant to and will have no\neffect on this proposal regarding the election of directors.\nPage 12\nUnless otherwise instructed, proxies and voting instructions given pursuant to this solicitation by the management of the\nCorporation will be voted for the election of the proposed nominees. If any proposed nominee is unable to serve as a director,\nthe individuals named in the enclosed form of proxy reserve the right to nominate and vote for another nominee in their\ndiscretion.\nAdvance Notice Provisions\nThe Corporation’s Articles (the “Articles”) provide for advance notice of nominations of directors which require that advance\nnotice be provided to the Corporation in circumstances where nominations of persons for election to the Board are made by\nshareholders of the Corporation other than pursuant to: (i) a requisition of a meeting of shareholders made pursuant to the\nprovisions of the BCBCA; or (ii) a shareholder proposal made pursuant to the provisions of the BCBCA, which is discussed in\nmore detail under the heading “Shareholder Proposals”.

If, with respect to any particular\nnominee, the number of votes withheld from voting by shareholders exceeds the number of votes for the nominee by\nshareholders, then although the director nominee will have been successfully elected to the Board pursuant to applicable corporate\nlaws, he or she will be required to offer to tender his or her resignation to the Chair of the CG&N Committee (defined below)\npromptly following the meeting of shareholders at which the director was so elected. The CG&N Committee will consider such\noffer and make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept it or not. The Board will promptly accept the resignation\nunless it determines, in consultation with the CG&N Committee, that there are exceptional circumstances that should delay the\nacceptance of the resignation or justify rejecting it. The Board will make its decision and announce it in a press release within 90\ndays following the applicable meeting of shareholders. A director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to the majority\nvoting policy will not participate in any meeting of the Board or the CG&N Committee at which the resignation is considered.\nNominees to the Board of Directors\nThe nominees for director, each of whom has consented to serve, if elected, are as follows:\nName of Nominee: Casey Hoyt\nResidence: Lafayette, Louisiana\nPosition: Chief Executive Officer and Director\nDirector Since: December 14, 2016\nAge:46\nPresent positions and officers with the Corporation, principal occupations and other directorships during the past 5 years:\nMr. Hoyt is the current Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, a position he has held since December 2017.

If Shareholders do not ratify the re-appointment of EY, the Audit Committee will evaluate the\nShareholder vote when considering the appointment of a registered public accounting firm for the audit engagement for the 2025\nfiscal year. In addition, if Shareholders approve the re-appointment of EY as the Corporation’s independent auditors, the Audit\nCommittee may nevertheless periodically request proposals from the major registered public accounting firms and as a result of\nsuch process may select EY or another registered public accounting firm as our independent auditors.\nRepresentatives of EY are expected to be present at the Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do\nso and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.\nThe Board recommends a vote “FOR” the re-appointment of EY as auditors of the Corporation for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2024, and the authorization of the Board to fix EY’s remuneration.\nThe re-appointment of EY as auditors of the Corporation for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, and the authorization of\nthe Board to fix EY’s remuneration requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast at the Meeting.\nBecause brokers generally have discretionary authority to vote on the re-appointment of the independent auditors, broker non-\nvotes are generally not expected to result from the vote on this proposal. Abstentions are not relevant to and will have no effect on\nthis proposal regarding the re-appointment of the independent auditors.\nPage 19\nFees Paid to Auditors\nThe following table shows the fees paid or accrued by the Corporation for the audit and other services provided by EY for fiscal\nyears 2023 and 2022.\n2023 2022\nAudit Fees $ 713,700 $ 494,717\nAudit-Related Fees 15,265 —\nTax Fees 212,051 114,630\nAll Other Fees — —\nTotals $ 941,016 $ 609,347\nAs defined by the SEC, (i) “audit fees” are fees for professional services rendered by the Corporation’s independent registered\npublic accounting firm for the audit of the Corporation’s annual financial statements and review of financial statements included\nin the Corporation’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or for services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection\nwith statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years; (ii) “audit-related fees” are fees for assurance and\nrelated services by the Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm that are reasonably related to the performance\nof the audit or review of the Corporation’s financial statements and are not reported under “audit fees”; (iii) “tax fees” are fees for\nprofessional services rendered by the Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm for tax compliance, tax advice,\nand tax planning; and (iv) “all other fees” are fees for products and services provided by the Corporation’s independent registered\npublic accounting firm, other than the services reported under “audit fees,” “audit-related fees,” and “tax fees.”\nPolicy on Pre-Approval by Audit Committee of Services Performed by Auditors\nUnder applicable SEC rules, except for the ability to designate a portion of this responsibility as described below, the full Audit\nCommittee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent registered public accounting\nfirm in order to ensure that they do not impair the auditors’ independence from the Corporation. The Audit Committee may\ndelegate pre-approval authority to a member of the Audit Committee. The SEC’s rules specify the types of non-audit services that\nan independent auditor may not provide to its audit client and establish the Audit Committee’s responsibility for administration of\nthe engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm. During 2023, all audit and non-audit services and fees were\npre-approved by the Audit Committee.\n(iv) Security Based Compensation Plan\nOn April 12, 2024, the Board approved the 2024 Long Term Incentive Plan of the Corporation (the “2024 Omnibus Plan”) to be\neffective the date of the Meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof (the “Effective Date”), pursuant to which the\nCorporation is able to issue share-based long-term incentives. All directors, officers, employees and consultants of the\nCorporation and/or its affiliates (“Participants”) are eligible to receive awards under the 2024 Omnibus Plan, subject to the terms\nof the 2024 Omnibus Plan. Awards include Common Share purchase options (“Options”), restricted stock (“Restricted Stock”),\nstock appreciation rights (“Stock Appreciation Rights” or “SARs”), performance awards (“Performance Awards”) or other\nstock-based awards, including restricted stock units (“RSUs”), deferred stock units (“DSUs”), and Dividends and Dividend\nEquivalents (as defined below) (collectively, the “Awards”), under the 2024 Omnibus Plan. A copy of the 2024 Omnibus Plan is\nattached as Schedule “A” to this Circular.\nThe Corporation’s current compensation program, described elsewhere in this Circular (see “Executive Compensation”)\nprovides total compensation for employees in various roles that is comprised of base salary (fixed cash amount), short-term\nperformance incentives (variable cash bonuses) and lastly, long-term “at risk” equity-based incentives (phantom shares, stock\noptions, RSUs and DSUs) that align employees’ interests with those of shareholders. The use of equity-based compensation as\npart of a competitive total compensation package for employees in certain roles also allows the Corporation to offer lower base\nsalaries, thereby lowering its fixed cash compensation costs. With a view to extending the cash resources that the Corporation has\navailable, it is important for the Corporation to be prudent in the management of its fixed cash expenses across all areas of\noperations, including in the area of employee compensation.\nPage 20\nPurpose of the 2024 Omnibus Plan\nThe 2024 Omnibus Plan serves several purposes for the Corporation. One purpose is to advance the interests of the Corporation\nby developing the interests of Participants in the growth and development of the Corporation by providing such persons with the\nopportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in the Corporation. All Participants are considered eligible to be selected to receive an\nAward under the 2024 Omnibus Plan. Another purpose is to attract and retain key talent and valuable personnel, who are\nnecessary to the Corporation’s success and reputation, with a competitive compensation mechanism. Finally, the 2024 Omnibus\nPlan will align the interests of Participants with those of shareholders by devising a compensation mechanism which encourages\nthe prudent maximization of distributions to shareholders and long-term growth.\nWith shareholder approval of the 2024 Omnibus Plan, the main components of the Corporation’s compensation program will be\nas follows: (i) base salary (fixed cash amount), (ii) short-term performance incentives (variable cash bonuses) and (iii) a broad\nrange of long-term “at risk” equity-based incentives under the 2024 Omnibus Plan.\nThe 2024 Omnibus Plan is administered by the Board or a committee of the Board.\n2024 Omnibus Plan Maximum and Limits\nIf the Corporation’s shareholders approve the 2024 Omnibus Plan, the limits with respect to Security Based Compensation\nArrangements included in Sections 4.1 and 27 of the existing 2020 Long Term Incentive Plan of the Corporation (effective June\n11, 2020) (the “2020 LTIP”) will be removed effective as of the date of such approval and no future awards will be granted under\nthe 2020 LTIP. The maximum number of Common Shares that will be available for Awards and issuance under the 2024\nOmnibus Plan and that may be reserved for issuance, at any time, under the 2024 Omnibus Plan, the 2020 LTIP, the Amended\nand Restated Stock Option Plan of the Corporation (effective as of July 17, 2018) (the “2018 Option Plan”) and the Amended\nand Restated Restricted Share Unit Plan and the Deferred Share Unit Plan of the Corporation (effective July 17, 2018) (the “2018\nRSU/DSU Plan,” and, together with the 2020 LTIP and the 2018 Option Plan, the “Prior Plans”) will be 7,800,000 Common\nShares. The maximum number of the foregoing Common Shares that may be awarded under the 2024 Omnibus Plan as “Incentive\nStock Options” (as defined in the 2024 Omnibus Plan) will be 1,000,000 Common Shares.\nAs of April 12, 2024, 5,672,467 Common Shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding awards under the Prior Plans\nand 261,873 Common Shares were available for issuance under the 2020 LTIP. Accordingly, the approval of the 2024 Omnibus\nPlan represents an effective increase in the number of Common Shares available for issuance as share-based long-term incentives\nto directors, officers, employees and consultants of the Corporation of 1,865,660 Common Shares as of such date.\nAny Common Shares underlying outstanding Awards that for any reason expire or are terminated, forfeited or canceled shall\nagain be available for issuance under the 2024 Omnibus Plan; provided, however, that amounts withheld for taxes or withheld for\nthe purchase price for Options or SARs shall not again be available for issuance under the 2024 Omnibus Plan, but shares of stock\nwithheld and not issued to a participant in order to satisfy ͏the purchase price or for the payment of taxes for restricted stock,\nperformance awards or other stock-based awards (other than an Option or SAR) shall be available for issuance under the 2024\nOmnibus Plan. Any Common Shares forfeited, cancelled or otherwise not issued for any reason under the awards of the Prior\nPlans and that would have been available for awards and issuance under the Prior Plans pursuant to the terms of those Prior Plans\nshall be available for Awards and issuance under the 2024 Omnibus Plan. Any awards outstanding under the Prior Plans shall\nremain subject to the terms of those awards and the Prior Plans. Awards that by their terms are to be settled solely in cash shall\nnot be counted against the maximum number of Common Shares available for the issuance of Awards under the 2024 Omnibus\nPlan.\nThe amount of Awards granted to a non-employee director, within a calendar year period, pursuant to the 2024 Omnibus Plan\nshall not exceed US$500,000 in value of the aggregate of Common Share and cash Awards. The 2024 Omnibus Plan does not\notherwise provide for a maximum number of Common Shares which may be issued to an individual pursuant to the 2024\nOmnibus Plan.\nCessation of Service and Transferability\nThe Compensation Committee (defined below) may provide the circumstances in which Awards shall be exercised, vested, paid\nor forfeited in the event a Participant ceases to provide service to the Corporation or any affiliate prior to the end of a performance\nperiod or exercise or settlement of such Award.\nSubject to limited exceptions in the 2024 Omnibus Plan for certain Awards, an Award may be assignable or transferable by a\nParticipant only by will or by the laws of descent and distribution following the death of the Participant.\nPage 21\nAdjustments and Change in Control of the Corporation\nIn the event of any stock dividend or extraordinary cash dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, recapitalization, combination,\nreclassification or similar change in the capital structure of the Corporation, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the number\nand class of Common Shares subject to the 2024 Omnibus Plan and to any outstanding Awards and in the exercise price per share\nof any outstanding Awards.\nIn the event of a Change in Control (as such term is defined in the 2024 Omnibus Plan) of the Corporation, the Compensation\nCommittee, in its sole discretion, shall have the power and right to (but subject to any accelerated vesting specified in an Award\nagreement):\ni. cancel, effective immediately prior to or upon the occurrence of the Change in Control of the Corporation, each\noutstanding Award (whether or not then vested or exercisable) (including the cancellation of any Options for which the\nexercise price is greater than the consideration to be received), and with respect to Options and Stock Appreciation\nRights that currently have an exercise price less than the consideration to be received immediately prior to the Change in\nControl of the Corporation, pay to the Participant an amount in cash equal to the excess of (i) the value, as determined by\nthe Compensation Committee, of the property (including cash) received by shareholders as a result of such Change in\nControl of the Corporation over (ii) the exercise price of such Award, if any, subject to certain exceptions;\nii. provide for the exchange or substitution of each Award outstanding immediately prior to or upon such Change in Control\nof the Corporation (whether or not then vested or exercisable) for another Award with respect to the Common Shares or\nother property for which such Award is exchangeable and, incident thereto, make an equitable adjustment as determined\nby the Compensation Committee in the exercise price of the Award, if any, or in the number of Common Shares or\namount of property (including cash) subject to the Award; or\niii. provide for assumption of the 2024 Omnibus Plan and such outstanding Awards by the surviving entity or its parent.\nAmendment and Administration Provision\nThe Compensation Committee may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate the 2024 Omnibus Plan and any outstanding\nAwards granted thereunder, in whole or in part, at any time without notice to or approval by the shareholders of the Corporation,\nfor any purpose whatsoever, including:\ni. to determine the persons to whom, and the time or times at which, Awards shall be granted and the number of Common\nShares to be subject to each Award;\nii. to designate Awards as Restricted Stock or Options or other stock-based Awards or Performance Awards or Dividends or\nDividend Equivalents, and to designate Options as Incentive Stock Options or Nonstatutory Stock Options (as such terms\nare defined in the 2024 Omnibus Plan);\niii. to determine the Fair Market Value (as such term is defined in the 2024 Omnibus Plan) of Common Shares or the fair\nmarket value of other property;\niv. to determine the terms, conditions and restrictions applicable to each Award (which need not be identical) and any\nCommon Shares acquired upon the exercise and/or vesting thereof, including, without limitation, (a) the exercise price of\nan Option or Stock Appreciation Right, (b) the method of payment for Common Shares purchased upon the exercise and/\nor vesting of an Award, (c) the method for satisfaction of any tax withholding obligation arising in connection with the\nAward or such Common Shares, including by the withholding or delivery of Common Shares, (d) the timing, terms and\nconditions, including but not limited to performance goals, the exercisability of the Award or the vesting of any Common\nShares, (e) the time of the expiration of the Award, (f) the effect of the Participant’s termination of service on any of the\nforegoing, (g) the provision for electronic delivery of Awards and/or book entry of Awards and (h) all other terms,\nconditions and restrictions applicable to the Award or such Common Shares not inconsistent with the terms of the 2024\nOmnibus Plan;\nv. to approve one or more forms of Award agreement;\nvi. to amend, modify, extend, cancel or renew any provision of any Award, or to waive any restrictions or conditions\napplicable to any Award or any Common Shares acquired upon the exercise thereof; provided, however, that no such\nPage 22\namendment, modification, extension or cancellation shall materially adversely affect a Participant’s Award without a\nParticipant’s consent;\nvii. to accelerate, continue, extend or defer the exercisability and/or vesting of any Award, including with respect to the\nperiod following a Participant’s termination of service;\nviii.to add or amend a cashless exercise provision attaching to any Award;\nix. to add or amend a financial assistance provision attaching to any Award;\nx. to prescribe, amend or rescind rules, guidelines and policies relating to the 2024 Omnibus Plan, or to adopt supplements\nto, or alternative versions of, the 2024 Omnibus Plan, including, without limitation, as the Compensation Committee\ndeems necessary or desirable to comply with the laws of, or to accommodate the tax policy or custom of, foreign\njurisdictions whose citizens may be granted Awards; and\nxi. to correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the 2024 Omnibus Plan or any Award\nagreement and to make all other determinations and take such other actions with respect to the 2024 Omnibus Plan or\nany Award as the Compensation Committee may deem advisable to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of the\n2024 Omnibus Plan or applicable law.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the following amendments to the 2024 Omnibus Plan require the approval of shareholders of the\nCorporation:\ni. an increase in the maximum number of Common Shares that may be made the subject of Awards under the 2024\nOmnibus Plan;\nii. any change in the class of persons eligible to receive Awards or purchase Common Shares under the 2024 Omnibus Plan,\nor any extension of the term of the 2024 Omnibus Plan;\niii. any adjustment (other than as set out in the 2024 Omnibus Plan) or amendment that reduces or would have the effect of\nreducing the exercise price of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right previously granted under the 2024 Omnibus Plan,\nwhether through amendment, cancellation, replacement grants or other means (provided that, in such a case, insiders of\nthe Corporation who benefit from such amendment are not eligible to vote their Common Shares in respect of the\napproval);\niv. any amendment to the plan amendment provisions, subject to certain exceptions included in the 2024 Omnibus Plan; and\nv. any amendment that would require approval of shareholders under any applicable law, regulation or rule or the stock\nexchange or market system on which the Common Shares are traded.\nDividends\nThe Compensation Committee shall determine whether Awards (other than Options and Stock Appreciation Rights) shall receive\ndividends or amounts equivalent to cash, Common Shares or other property as dividends on Common Shares (“Dividends” or\n“Dividend Equivalents”) with respect to the number of Common Shares covered by the Award; provided, however, any\nDividends or Dividend Equivalents with respect to Common Shares covered by an Award shall be subject to restrictions and risk\nof forfeiture to the same extent as those Common Shares covered by the Award with respect to such Dividends or Dividend\nEquivalents. In no event will Dividends or Dividend Equivalents be awarded with respect to an Option or Stock Appreciation\nRights.\nOptions\nOptions under the 2024 Omnibus Plan include Nonstatutory Stock Options and Incentive Stock Options.\nThe exercise price per Common Share under an Option shall be determined by the Compensation Committee; provided, however,\nthat, subject to certain exceptions described in the 2024 Omnibus Plan, such exercise price shall not be less than 100% of the Fair\nMarket Value of a Common Share on the date of grant of such Option. With the approval of the Compensation Committee, a\nParticipant may elect to exercise an Option, in whole or in part, on a ‘cashless exercise’ basis, without payment of the aggregate\nPage 23\nOption price due on such exercise by electing to receive Common Shares equal in value to the difference between the Option\nprice and the Fair Market Value on the date of exercise, computed in accordance with the 2024 Omnibus Plan.\nThe term of each Option shall be fixed by the Compensation Committee, but shall not exceed 10 years from the date of grant\nthereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to certain exceptions detailed in the 2024 Omnibus Plan, if the term of an\nOption would otherwise expire during, or within nine business days of the expiration of a Black-Out Period (as such term is\ndefined in the 2024 Omnibus Plan) applicable to such Participant, then the term of such Option shall be extended, in accordance\nwith Section 409A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), to the close of business on the tenth business day following\nthe expiration of the Black-Out Period.\nUnless the Compensation Committee decides otherwise, Options granted under 2024 Omnibus Plan will expire at the earliest of:\n(i) the expiry date set out in the applicable Award agreement; (ii) three months after termination due to disability of the Participant\nor one year after the Participant’s death; (iii) three months after termination without “cause” following a Change in Control of the\nCorporation; (iv) in the case of a termination for “cause”, the expiry date set out in the applicable Award agreement; and (v) three\nmonths following the Participant’s termination for any other reason.\nIncentive Stock Options may only be granted to employees. To the extent Options designated as Incentive Stock Options become\nexercisable for the first time during any calendar year for Common Shares having an aggregate fair market value greater than\nUS$100,000, the portion of such Options which exceeds such amount shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. Incentive\nStock Options are subject to additional requirements and restrictions as provided in the 2024 Omnibus Plan and as required by the\nCode.\nRestricted Stock\nThe 2024 Omnibus Plan, if approved, will provide the Compensation Committee with additional equity-based compensation\nalternatives in the form of Restricted Stock, which provide an “at risk” equity-based incentive and may replace short-term cash\nbased incentives currently provided for in the Corporation’s compensation plan.\nRestricted Stock consists of Common Shares that are subject to such restrictions as the Compensation Committee may impose\n(including, without limitation, restrictions on voting and transferability, or that constitute any limitation on the right to receive any\nDividend or Dividend Equivalent or other right), which restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such time or times,\nin such installments or otherwise, as the Compensation Committee may deem appropriate.\nRestricted Stock shall be awarded for no additional consideration or such additional consideration as the Compensation\nCommittee may determine, which consideration may be equal to or more than the Fair Market Value of the Common Shares on\nthe grant date.\nOther Stock-Based Awards\nUnder the 2024 Omnibus Plan, the Compensation Committee may grant other stock-based Awards that are denominated or\npayable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise related to, Common Shares, as deemed by the Compensation\nCommittee to be consistent with the purposes of the 2024 Omnibus Plan and the goals of the Corporation, including, without\nlimitation, RSU/DSUs, Stock Appreciation Rights and phantom awards. Stock Appreciation Rights are subject to the same\nrequirements as Nonstatutory Options.\nOther stock-based Awards may be settled in Common Shares, cash or a combination thereof.\nPerformance Awards may be granted by the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, in the form of cash or Common\nShares (including Restricted Stock) or a combination thereof based upon the achievement of goals as determined by the\nCompensation Committee. Types of other stock-based Awards or Performance Awards include, without limitation, purchase\nrights, phantom stock, Stock Appreciation Rights, RSU/DSUs, performance units, Restricted Stock or Common Shares subject to\nperformance goals, Common Shares awarded that are not subject to any restrictions or conditions, convertible or exchangeable\ndebentures related to Common Shares, other rights convertible into Common Shares, Awards valued by reference to the value of\nCommon Shares or the performance of the Corporation or a specified subsidiary, affiliate division or department, Awards based\nupon performance goals established by the Compensation Committee and settlement in cancellation of rights of any person with a\nvested interest in any other plan, fund, program or arrangement that is or was sponsored, maintained or participated in by the\nCorporation or any subsidiary.\nPage 24\nIn its sole discretion, the Compensation Committee may specify such criteria, periods or performance goals for vesting in the\nforegoing stock-based Awards or Performance Awards and/or payment thereof to Participants; and the extent to which such\ncriteria, periods or goals have been met shall be determined by the Compensation Committee. All terms and conditions of such\nstock-based Awards and Performance Awards shall be determined by the Compensation Committee and set forth in the applicable\nAward agreement.\nSummary of Certain Federal Income Tax Considerations\nThe following summary is based on certain applicable provisions of the Code, as currently in effect, and the income tax\nregulations and proposed income tax regulations issued thereunder. This summary does not purport to cover all federal income tax\nconsequences or any federal employment tax or other federal tax consequences that may be associated with the 2024 Omnibus\nPlan, nor does it cover state, local, employment, foreign or other taxes.\nStatus of Options. Options granted under the 2024 Omnibus Plan may be either Incentive Stock Options or Nonstatutory Stock\nOptions. Under certain circumstances, an Incentive Stock Option may be treated as a Nonstatutory Stock Option. The tax\nconsequences, both to the option holder and to the Corporation, differ depending on whether an Option is an Incentive Stock\nOption or a Nonstatutory Stock Option.\nNonstatutory Stock Options. Generally, no federal income tax is imposed on the Option holder upon the grant of a Nonstatutory\nStock Option. If the Common Shares received by an option holder upon the exercise of a Nonstatutory Stock Option are not\nsubject to certain restrictions in the hands of the Option holder, then the Option holder will be treated as receiving compensation,\ntaxable as ordinary income in the year of exercise. The amount recognized as ordinary income upon such an exercise is the excess\nof the fair market value of the Common Shares at the time of exercise over the exercise price paid for such Common Shares.\nIncentive Stock Options. No federal income tax is imposed on the Option holder upon the grant or exercise of an Incentive Stock\nOption. The Option holder will recognize no ordinary income for federal income tax purposes upon disposition of Common\nShares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option, if the Option holder (i) does not dispose of the Common\nShares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option within two years from the date the Option was granted or\nwithin one year after the Common Shares were transferred to the Option holder (the “Holding Period”), and (ii) is an employee\nof either (a) the corporation granting the Option, (b) the parent corporation or a subsidiary corporation of the granting corporation,\nor (c) a corporation (or the parent corporation or a subsidiary corporation of such corporation) that has assumed such option of\nanother corporation as a result of a corporate reorganization, merger, or similar transaction. Such employment must continue for\nthe entire time from the date the Option was granted until three months before the date of exercise or twelve months before the\ndate of exercise if employment ceases due to permanent and total disability (as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code). If\nCommon Shares received upon exercise of an Incentive Stock Option are disposed of after completion of the Holding Period, any\ndifference between the exercise price paid for such Common Shares and the amount realized on the disposition will be treated as a\ncapital gain or loss. The gain, if any, realized upon such a disposition will be treated as a long-term capital gain. Any loss realized\nupon such a disposition will be treated as a long-term capital loss. In the case of disposition of Common Shares following\nexpiration of the Holding Period, the Corporation would not be entitled to any deduction in connection with the grant or exercise\nof the Incentive Stock Option or the disposition of the Common Shares so acquired.\nIf, however, an Option holder disposes of Common Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option before\nexpiration of the Holding Period (a “Disqualifying Disposition”), the Option holder would be treated as having received, at the\ntime of disposition, compensation taxable as ordinary income.\nAlthough the exercise of an Incentive Stock Option does not result in current taxable income, there are implications with regard to\nthe Alternative Minimum Tax (“AMT”). The excess of the fair market value of Common Shares acquired upon exercise of an\nIncentive Stock Option over the exercise price paid for such Common Shares is an adjustment to AMT income for the Option\nholder’s taxable year in which such exercise occurs (unless the Common Shares are disposed of in the same taxable year and the\namount realized is less than the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise, in which event the amount included in\nAMT income will not exceed the amount realized on the disposition over the adjusted basis of the shares).\nStock Appreciation Rights. Upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, if Common Shares are received in settlement of the\nStock Appreciation Right, the fair market value of those shares received is recognized as income for federal income tax purposes\nat the time of exercise. If a participant receives cash upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, the amount of cash received\nis recognized as income for federal income tax purposes at the time of exercise.\nPage 25\nRestricted Stock. Generally, the grant of Restricted Stock will not be a taxable event to the participant, and the Corporation will\nnot receive a deduction. Absent an 83(b) election (described below), the participant will be taxed at ordinary income rates when\nthe Restricted Stock vests (an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the Restricted Stock on the vesting\ndate and the consideration paid, if any, for the shares), and the Corporation will receive a corresponding deduction. However, the\nparticipant may elect to make an 83(b) election not later than 30 days after the grant of the Restricted Stock. An 83(b) election is\nan election permitted under Section 83(b) of the Code that allows the participant to recognize compensation income on the\nRestricted Stock at the time of the grant equal to the difference between the fair market value of the Restricted Stock on the date\nof grant and the amount paid, if any, for the shares. If the participant makes an 83(b) election, the Corporation receives a\ncorresponding deduction at the time of the grant, and the participant is not taxed, nor does the Corporation receive any deduction,\nupon vesting of the shares.\nWhen the participant sells the shares following vesting, he or she may realize a capital gain if the sales price is greater than his or\nher basis in the shares. The participant’s basis for this purpose is the fair market value at the time of vesting (if no 83(b) election is\nmade) or at the time of grant (if an 83(b) election is made). The Corporation does not receive a deduction upon disposition of the\nstock by the participant. If, following vesting, the participant sells the shares and the amount realized is more than the\nparticipant’s basis in the stock, the participant will recognize a capital gain. If, following vesting, the participant sells the shares\nand the amount realized is less than the participant’s basis in the stock, the participant will recognize a capital loss. The capital\ngain or loss will be either short-term or long-term, depending on the holding period of the shares. The holding period commences\nupon vesting (if no 83(b) election is made) or upon grant (if an 83(b) election is made).\nRestricted Stock Units. In general, a participant who receives a RSU award will not be taxed on receipt of the award; instead,\nupon vesting (or potentially settlement, depending upon how the RSU is structured), the amount paid to the participant (whether\nin cash, shares, or a combination thereof) denominated in cash will be taxable as compensation to the participant.\nOther Tax Considerations\nIn the event of a change of control of the Corporation, certain payments in the nature of compensation to certain individuals, if\ncontingent on the change of control, could be nondeductible to the Corporation and subject to an additional 20% tax to the\nparticipant. Awards under the 2024 Omnibus Plan that are made, vest, or become payable in connection with a change of control\nmay be required to be taken into account in determining whether these penalties apply.\nSome Awards granted under the 2024 Omnibus Plan may be considered non-qualified deferred compensation that is subject to\nspecial rules and an additional 20% tax to the participant if not compliant with Section 409A of the Code. The administrator of the\n2024 Omnibus Plan intends to design and administer such Awards either to be exempt from or to comply with Section 409A of\nthe Code and avoid the imposition of any additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, but is not required to do so. There is no\ncommitment or guarantee that any federal, state, local, or foreign tax treatment will (or will not) apply or be available to any\nparticipant with respect to any Award.\nInapplicability of ERISA\nBased on current law and published interpretations, the Corporation does not believe that the 2024 Omnibus Plan is subject to any\nof the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 2024\nOmnibus Plan expressly provides that there is no commitment or guarantee that any federal, state, or local tax treatment will (or\nwill not) apply or be available to any person who participates or is eligible to participate in the 2024 Omnibus Plan.\nShareholder Approval\nThe 2024 Omnibus Plan has been adopted and authorized by the Board to be effective the date of the Meeting, or any\nadjournment or postponement thereof, subject to the approval of shareholders at the Meeting. The 2024 Omnibus Plan will\ncontinue until the earlier of termination by the Board or 10 years from the Effective Date.\nPage 26\nAs of April 12, 2024, there were 4,148,137 stock options outstanding and unexercised under the 2020 LTIP and the 2018 Option\nPlan, and 1,524,330 RSUs outstanding under the 2020 LTIP, representing in the aggregate 14.6% of the issued and outstanding\nCommon Shares as of such date. No Common Shares are reserved for issuance under the 2018 RSU/DSU Plan. If the 2024\nOmnibus Plan is approved at the Meeting, the 7,800,000 Common Shares that will be reserved for issuance under the 2024\nOmnibus Plan and the Prior Plans, which includes 5,672,467 Common Shares underlying the outstanding and unexercised stock\noptions and outstanding RSUs under the Prior Plans as of April 12, 2024, represents 20.1% of the total issued and outstanding\nCommon Shares as of April 12, 2024, and an effective increase in the number of Common Shares available for issuance as share-\nbased long-term incentives to directors, officers, employees and consultants of the Corporation of 1,865,660 Common Shares as\nof April 12, 2024.\nAt the Meeting, Shareholders will be asked to pass an ordinary resolution to ratify, confirm and approve the 2024 Long Term\nIncentive Plan, the full text of which is set out below (the “2024 Omnibus Plan Resolution”).\n2024 Omnibus Plan Resolution\nWHEREAS the Board of Directors of Viemed Healthcare, Inc. (the “Corporation”) has determined that adoption of the 2024\nLong Term Incentive Plan of the Corporation (the “ 2024 Omnibus Plan”), as more fully set out in the copy of the 2024 Omnibus\nPlan attached hereto as Schedule “A,” is in the Corporation’s and its shareholders’ best interests;\nBE IT RESOLVED AS AN ORDINARY RESOLUTION OF THE SHAREHOLDERS THAT:\n1. The 2024 Omnibus Plan and the reservation for issuance thereunder and under the Prior Plans of 7,800,000 Common\nShares (including 1,000,000 Common Shares that may be issued as Incentive Stock Options), are hereby approved,\nratified and confirmed.\n2. The limits with respect to Security Based Compensation Arrangements included in Sections 4.1 and 27 of the 2020 LTIP\nare hereby removed and no future awards will be granted under the 2020 LTIP and any outstanding awards under the\n2020 LTIP shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of the 2020 LTIP as in effect on the date immediately\npreceding the date hereof.\n3. The 2024 Omnibus Plan be authorized and approved as a long term incentive plan of the Corporation, subject to any\nlimitations imposed by applicable regulations, laws, rules, and policies.\n4. Any officer or director of the Corporation is authorized and directed to execute and deliver, under corporate seal or\notherwise, all such documents and instruments and to do all such acts as in the opinion of such officer or director may be\nnecessary or desirable to give effect to this resolution.\nThe Board recommends a vote “FOR” the approval of the 2024 Omnibus Plan Resolution.\nThe approval of the 2024 Omnibus Plan Resolution requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast at the Meeting.\nBroker non-votes are not relevant to and will have no effect on this proposal regarding approval of the 2024 Omnibus Plan\nResolution.\nPage 27\n11. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DISCLOSURE\nSet forth below is a description of the Corporation’s current corporate governance practices, as prescribed by Form 58-101F1,\nwhich is attached to National Instrument 58-101 – Disclosure of Corporate Governance Practices (“NI 58-101”).\nBoard of Directors and Independence\nThe Board has determined that Randy Dobbs (Chairman), Nitin Kaushal, Timothy Smokoff, Bruce Greenstein and Sabrina Heltz,\ncurrent and prospective members of the Board, are independent as such term is defined in NI 58-101, and are independent ͏in\naccordance with the listing standards of NASDAQ.\nThe Board has determined that Casey Hoyt, W. Todd Zehnder and William Frazier, current and prospective members of the\nBoard, are not independent as such term is defined in NI 58-101 and are not independent ͏in accordance with the listing standards\nof NASDAQ, as they are executive officers (as such term is defined in NI 51-102) and employees of the Corporation.\nAccordingly, a majority of the current and prospective members of the Board are independent.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nOur Board is led by Randy Dobbs, the Corporation’s independent Chairman of the Board. The Board believes that this leadership\nstructure, which separates the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles, is appropriate at this time. The Board believes its\ncurrent leadership structure best serves the objectives of the Board’s oversight of management, the Board’s ability to carry out its\nroles and responsibilities on behalf of the Corporation’s shareholders and the Corporation’s overall corporate governance.\nAll of the members of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and CG&N Committee are independent as further\ndescribed below. The independent directors have the opportunity, at their discretion, to hold ad hoc meetings that are not attended\nby management and non-independent directors.\nThe Board believes that adequate structures and processes are in place to facilitate the functioning of the Board independently of\nthe Corporation’s management. The independent directors met together without management present four times during 2023. The\nregularly scheduled Board committee meetings give the independent directors the opportunity for open and frank discussions on\nall matters they consider relevant, including an assessment of their own performance. In addition, the Audit Committee meets\nperiodically with the Corporation’s auditors without management present. Accordingly, the Board believes that there is adequate\nleadership by the independent directors.\nMeetings of Independent Directors\nThe independent directors of the Board may, upon request, meet in executive session at any meeting of the Board. The\nindependent directors generally meet in executive sessions without management present during their regularly scheduled board\nmeetings, and on an as-needed basis during special meetings. During 2023, the independent directors held executive sessions at\neach of the four regularly-scheduled Board meetings in January, May, August and November.\nBoard’s Role in Risk Oversight\nThe Board oversees the Corporation’s management and, with the assistance of management, is actively involved in oversight of\nrisks that could affect the Corporation. The Board engages in the oversight of risk in various ways, including (i) reviewing and\napproving management’s operating plans and considering any risks that could affect operating results, (ii) reviewing the structure\nand operation of the Corporation’s various departments and functions and (iii) in connection with the review and approval of\nparticular transactions and initiatives, reviewing related risk analyses and mitigation plans.\nThe Board has also delegated certain risk oversight responsibility to committees of the Board as follows: (i) the Audit Committee\nmeets periodically with management to discuss the Corporation’s process for assessing and managing risks, including the\nCorporation’s major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures; (ii) the\nCompensation Committee reviews the Corporation’s incentive compensation arrangements to determine whether such\narrangements encourage excessive risk-taking and discusses, at least annually, the relationship between risk management policies\nand practices and compensation; and (iii) the CG&N Committee oversees risk related to corporate governance and cybersecurity.\nThe Corporation’s management regularly reports to the full Board and, as appropriate, the committees of the Board regarding\nenterprise risk that the Corporation must mitigate and manage.\nPage 28\nMeeting Attendance\nDuring 2023, there were five meetings of the Board of Directors, four meetings of the Audit Committee, four meetings of the\nCompensation Committee, and two meetings of the CG&N Committee. The attendance by directors for meetings of the Board and\nBoard committees held during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, was as follows:\nAudit Committee Compensation CG&N Committee\nName Board Meetings Meetings Committee Meetings Meetings\nCasey Hoyt 5/5 N/A N/A N/A\nW.

Casey Hoyt and Todd Zehnder attended last\nyear’s annual meeting.\nDirectorships\nExcept as set out in the table below, no directors and prospective directors of the Corporation are presently directors of other\nentities that are reporting issuers (or the equivalent) in Canada and the United States.\nBoard Member Directorship of Other Reporting Issuers\nHigh Tide Inc. (NASDAQ: HITI) (TSXV: HITI) (FSE: 2LYA)\nNitin Kaushal Delta 9 Cannabis Inc. (TSX: DN) (OTCQX: DLTNF)\nEveryday People Financial Corp. (TSXV: EPF)\nBoard Mandate\nThe Board does not have a written mandate; however it operates through the leadership of an independent Chairman and three\ncommittees of the Board made up of independent directors.\nPosition Descriptions\nThe Board has not adopted a written description for the Chairman of the Board and the Chair of each Board committee. The\nChairman of the Board is responsible for the administration, development and efficient operation of the Board. The Chairman\nassists the Chief Executive Officer in overseeing the operational aspects involved in managing the Corporation. In addition, the\nChair ensures that the Board adequately discharges its mandate and that the Board’s responsibilities and lines of delineation\nbetween the Board and management are well understood by the directors. The Chair of each committee is to manage efficiently\nhis or her respective committee. Each committee Chair must ensure that the committee adequately discharges its mandate\npursuant to its written charter. Committee Chairs must report regularly to the Board on the business of their committee.\nThe Board and the Chief Executive Officer have not developed a written position description for the Chief Executive Officer. The\nBoard expects the Chief Executive Officer and the Corporation’s senior management team to be responsible for the management\nof the Corporation’s strategic and operational agenda and for the execution of the decisions of the Board.\nPage 29\nOrientation and Continuing Education\nPursuant to the orientation program put in place by the CG&N Committee, each new director of the Corporation attends a\ncomprehensive orientation session during which they are provided with product demonstrations and an education as to the nature\nand operation of the Corporation and its business, and members of senior management from each functional area within the\nCorporation present on wide-ranging topics concerning the Corporation, including regarding its corporate structure and financial\nand legal matters. The CG&N Committee is also responsible for coordinating the continuing education program for directors in\norder to maintain or enhance their skills and abilities as directors, as well as ensuring that their knowledge and understanding of\nthe Corporation and its business remains current. Internal personnel regularly make presentations to the Board on relevant and\nmaterial topics.\nDirectors are encouraged to communicate with management, auditors and technical consultants and to keep themselves current\nwith industry trends and developments and changes in legislation with management’s assistance. Directors have full access to the\nCorporation’s records.\nEthical Business Conduct\nThe Board maintains that the Corporation must conduct, and be seen to conduct, its business dealings in accordance with all\napplicable laws and the highest ethical standards.\nThe Board has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to our directors, officers and employees. Our Code of\nBusiness Conduct and Ethics has been filed under the Corporation’s profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and is available on\nthe corporate governance section of Corporation’s website (which is a subsection of the investor relations section of Corporation’s\nwebsite) at the following address: www.viemed.com/investors. The Corporation intends to disclose on its website any\namendments or waivers to the Code that are required to be disclosed by SEC rules.\nThe Corporation’s reputation for honesty and integrity amongst its shareholders and other stakeholders will be key to the success\nof its business. No employee or director will be permitted to achieve results through violation of laws or regulations, or through\nunscrupulous dealings.\nAny director with a conflict of interest or who is capable of being perceived as being in conflict of interest with respect to the\nCorporation must abstain from discussion and voting by the Board or any committee of the Board on any motion to recommend\nor approve the relevant agreement or transaction. The Board must comply with conflict of interest provisions of the BCBCA.\nNomination of Directors\nThe CG&N Committee is currently responsible for identifying candidates for election to the Board. The Corporation’s Articles\nalso provide for advance notice of nominations of directors by shareholders of the Corporation at its annual meeting of\nshareholders. The Corporation does not have a formal policy concerning shareholders nominations of individuals to stand for\nelection to the Board, other than the provisions contained in the Corporation’s Articles. Since the Corporation’s spin out from\nPHM, the Corporation has not received any recommendations from shareholders requesting that the Board consider a candidate\nfor inclusion among the slate of nominees in any year, and therefore the Corporation believes that no formal policy, in addition to\nthe provisions contained in the Corporation’s Articles, concerning shareholders recommendations is needed. For further\ninformation regarding the Board nomination procedures under the Corporation’s Articles, see “Business of the Meeting – Election\nof Directors” above and “Shareholder Proposals – Advance Notice Provisions” below.\nThe CG&N Committee is responsible for periodically reviewing the size of the Board, with a view to determining the impact of\nthe number of directors on the effectiveness of the Board, and identifying potential nominees to the Board, reviewing their\nqualifications and experience, determining their independence as required under all applicable corporate and securities laws and\nrecommending to the Board the nominees for consideration by, and presentation to, the shareholders at the Corporation’s next\nannual meeting of shareholders. In making its recommendations, the CG&N Committee applies the standards established in the\nCG&N Committee Charter and considers the competencies and skills that the Board considers to be necessary for the Board as a\nwhole to possess, the competencies and skills that the Board considers each existing director to possess, as well as the\ncompetencies and skills each new nominee will bring to the boardroom. The CG&N Committee also considers the amount of time\nand resources that nominees have available to fulfill their duties as Board members or committee members, as applicable.\nPage 30\nWhile the Board has not adopted a written policy concerning Board diversity, the Board believes that diversity along multiple\ndimensions, including gender, race, ethnicity and professional expertise and experience, is important in providing the necessary\nrange of perspectives required to achieve objectives. The Board recognizes that gender diversity is a significant aspect of diversity\nand acknowledges the important contributions that women with the right competencies and skills can make to the diversity of\nperspective in the boardroom. Accordingly, in order to promote the specific objective of gender diversity, the selection process for\nBoard appointees/nominees by the Corporation will continue the pursuit of potential female candidates and if, at the end of the\nselection process, no female candidates are selected, the Board must be satisfied that there are objective reasons to support this\ndetermination.\nOn an annual basis, the CG&N Committee will assess the effectiveness of the Board’s appointment/nomination process at\nachieving diversity and consider and, if determined advisable, recommend to the Board for adoption, measurable objectives for\nachieving diversity on the Board. At this time, the Corporation has not adopted a target regarding women or underrepresented\nminorities on the Board as the Board believes that arbitrary targets are not in the best interests of the Corporation or its\nshareholders. The Board is committed to nominating the best individuals to be elected as directors.\nThe CG&N Committee is also responsible for periodically examining and making recommendations to the Board in relation to\nmechanisms of Board renewal. The Corporation currently does not have any policies imposing a term or retirement age limit in\nconnection with individuals nominated for election as directors, as the CG&N Committee and the Board believe that such\narbitrary limits are not in the best interests of the Corporation or its shareholders. It is the Board’s intention to strive to achieve a\nbalance between the desirability to have a depth of institutional experience from its members on the one hand, and the need for\nrenewal and new perspectives on the other hand.\nBoard Committees\nThere were three standing committees of the Board during 2023: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the\nCG&N Committee. Written charters for each of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and CG&N Committee are\navailable on the corporate governance section of the Corporation’s website (which is a subsection of the investor relations section\nof Corporation’s website) at the following address: www.viemed.com/investors.\nAudit Committee\nThe Audit Committee is a standing committee appointed by the Board.

The Audit Committee has reviewed and approved the amount of fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP for audit and\nnon-audit services and has concluded that the provision of services by Ernst & Young LLP is compatible with the maintenance of\nErnst & Young LLP’s independence.\nBased on the above-mentioned review and discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm,\nand subject to the limitations on the Audit Committee’s role and responsibilities described above and in the Audit Committee\nCharter, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Corporation’s audited consolidated financial\nstatements be included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, for filing with the SEC.\nSubmitted on behalf of the Audit Committee\nNitin Kaushal, Chair\nRandy Dobbs\nBruce Greenstein\nPage 33\nAssessments\nThe CG&N Committee, in consultation with the Chairman of the Board, is responsible for ensuring that an appropriate system is\nin place to evaluate the effectiveness of the Board, the Board committees and individual directors, with a view to ensuring that\nthey are fulfilling their respective responsibilities and duties and working effectively together as a unit.\nThe CG&N Committee informally monitors director performance throughout the year (noting particularly any directors who have\nhad a change in their primary job responsibilities or who have assumed additional directorships since their last assessment) to\nensure that the Board, the Board committees and individual directors are performing effectively. From time to time the CG&N\nCommittee may also choose to complete a formal assessment process consisting of completion of a written survey by each\nmember of the Board, on request, conducting one-on-one discussions in order to assess such matters as the composition of the\nBoard, the conduct of and agendas for meetings of the Board and its committees, and the role and impact of the Board. The results\nof such surveys and interviews are then summarized to identify strengths, opportunities and further suggestions with respect to\neach area of discussion and the Chairman of the Board is to report on such summary to the GN&C Committee and to the rest of\nthe Board.\nCommunications with the Board of Directors\nShareholders may communicate with the Board, any of the Board committees, non-employee directors as a group and individual\ndirectors by submitting their communications in writing to Viemed Healthcare, Inc., 625 E. Kaliste Saloom Rd., Lafayette,\nLouisiana 70508, Attn: Corporate Secretary. Any communication must contain the following:\n• a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of the Corporation’s capital stock;\n• the name and address, as they appear on the Corporation’s books, of the shareholder sending the communication; and\n• the number of shares of the Corporation’s capital stock that are beneficially owned by such shareholder.\nThe Corporation’s Corporate Secretary will distribute such communications to the intended recipient upon receipt, unless the\ncommunication is unduly hostile, threatening, illegal or otherwise inappropriate, in which case the Corporate Secretary has the\nauthority to discard the communication or to take appropriate legal action regarding the communication.\nHedging Policy\nThe Corporation’s insider trading policy prohibits its directors, officers and those employees and contractors who participate in\nthe preparation of the Corporation’s financial statements or who are privy to material financial information relating to the\nCorporation (including spouses, live-in partners or relatives of any such persons who reside in the same household as such\npersons) from entering into hedging or monetization transactions or similar arrangements with respect to Corporation’s securities.\nThe policy also prohibits such persons from entering into the following transactions: selling the Corporation’s securities short,\nbuying or selling puts or calls or other derivative securities on the Corporation’s securities, holding Corporation securities in a\nmargin account or pledging Corporation securities as collateral for a loan.

The Corporation’s clawback policy requires the clawback of erroneously paid\nincentive-based compensation paid to current and former executive officers in the event of a restatement of the Corporation’s\nfinancial statements (without regard to the fault of the executive). Restatements that trigger such recoupment include restatements\ndue to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement applicable to the Corporation under the federal securities\nlaws, including required restatements to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously\nissued financial statements or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left\nuncorrected in the current period. Except in very limited circumstances, in the event of such a restatement, the clawback policy\nrequires the recoupment of incentive-based compensation paid to the executive officer in excess of the amount that would have\nbeen paid if the amount of such incentive-based compensation had been based on the restated financial statements.\nPage 34\n12.

The Corporation’s executive compensation program has the objectives of attracting and retaining a\nqualified and cohesive group of executives, motivating team performance and aligning of the interests of executives with the\ninterests of the Corporation’s shareholders through a package of compensation that is simple and easy to understand and\nimplement. Compensation under the program was designed to achieve both current and longer term goals of the Corporation and\nto optimize returns to shareholders. In addition, in order to further align the interests of executives with the interests of the\nCorporation’s shareholders, the Corporation has implemented share ownership incentives through the 2020 LTIP (defined below).\nThe Compensation Committee believes that the Corporation’s overall compensation objectives are consistent with its peer group\nof healthcare companies with opportunities to participate in equity ownership.\nIn determining the total compensation of any member of senior management, the Compensation Committee considers all elements\nof compensation in total rather than one element in isolation and considers the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer.\nThe Compensation Committee also examines the competitive positioning of total compensation and the mix of fixed, incentive\nand share-based compensation.\nAlthough the Corporation qualifies as an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company under U.S. securities laws,\nand accordingly may provide disclosure of the Corporation’s executive compensation program under the scaled-down reporting\nrules under U.S. securities laws applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies, the Corporation is\nproviding additional detail with respect to its executive compensation, including in “Compensation Governance” and\n“Performance Graph” and in the “Summary Compensation Table,” “Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End 2023” table,\n“Incentive Plan Awards - Value Vested or Earned During the Year” tables and “Outstanding Share-Based Awards and Option-\nBased Awards” tables consistent with the disclosure requirements that apply under Canadian securities laws.\nPage 36\nCompensation Governance\nThe Board established the Compensation Committee as a standing committee of the Board. The Compensation Committee assists\nthe Board in discharging the directors’ oversight responsibilities relating to the compensation and retention of key senior\nmanagement employees, and in particular the Chief Executive Officer.\nThe Compensation Committee comprises three (3) directors, Timothy Smokoff (Chair), Randy Dobbs and Sabrina Heltz. Each\nmember of the Compensation Committee is independent as such term is defined in NI 52-110 and in the BCBCA, as well as under\nNASDAQ rules.\nThe Compensation Committee operates under the Charter of the Compensation Committee, pursuant to which the Compensation\nCommittee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the following: setting policies for senior\nofficers’ remuneration; reviewing and approving and then recommending to the Board salary, bonus and other benefits, direct or\nindirect, and any change-of-control packages of the Chief Executive Officer; considering the recommendations of the Chief\nExecutive Officer and setting the terms and conditions of employment including, approving the salary, bonus and other benefits,\ndirect or indirect, and any change-of-control packages, of the key executives of the Corporation; undertaking an annual review of\nthe Chief Executive Officer goals for the coming year and reviewing progress in achieving those goals; reviewing compensation\nof the Board on at least an annual basis; overseeing the administration of the Corporation’s compensation plans, including stock\noption plans, compensation plans for outside directors and such other compensation plans or structures as are adopted by the\nCorporation from time to time; reviewing and approving executive compensation disclosure to be made in the management\ninformation and proxy circular prepared in connection with each annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation; and\nundertaking on behalf of the Board such other compensation initiatives as may be necessary or desirable to contribute to the\nsuccess of the Corporation and enhance shareholder value. During 2023, the Compensation Committee engaged Arthur J.\nGallagher & Co. (“Gallagher”) as its independent compensation consultant in order to assist with the establishment, structuring,\nand continued evaluation of executive compensation. In compliance with SEC rules, the Compensation Committee has assessed\nthe independence of Gallagher and concluded that no conflict of interest exists that would prevent Gallagher from independently\nrepresenting the Compensation Committee. Gallagher does not currently provide any services to the Corporation other than the\nservices provided directly to the Compensation Committee. Billing by Gallagher is provided directly to, and approved for\npayment by, the Compensation Committee.\nPage 37\nPerformance Graph\nThe following graph compares the total cumulative return on funds invested in Common Shares of the Corporation, compared to\nthe total cumulative return of (i) the cumulative total return of the Russell 2000 Index and (ii) the cumulative total return of the\nS&P Healthcare Services Select Industry Index, in each case, for the period from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2023:\ntnemtsevnI\n001$\nfo\neulaV\n$300\n$250\n$200\n$150\n$100\n$50\n$0\nDec 31, 2018 Dec 31, 2019 Dec 31, 2020 Dec 31, 2021 Dec 31, 2022 Dec 31, 2023\nViemed Healthcare, Inc.\nRussell 2000 Index\nS&P Healthcare Services Select Industry Index\nDec 31, 2018 Dec 31, 2019 Dec 31, 2020 Dec 31, 2021 Dec 31, 2022 Dec 31, 2023\nViemed Healthcare, Inc. $ 100 $ 163 $ 204 $ 137 $ 199 $ 207\nRussell 2000 Index $ 100 $ 124 $ 146 $ 167 $ 131 $ 150\nS&P Healthcare Services Select\nIndustry Index $ 100 $ 118 $ 157 $ 172 $ 138 $ 144\nOver this period, the Corporation’s share price increased by 107% and has outperformed the Russell 2000 Index and S&P\nHealthcare Services Select Industry Index which have increased by 50% and 44%, respectively. The S&P/TSX Composite Index\nhas been removed from the performance graph as a result of the Corporation's voluntary delisting of its common shares from TSX\nin 2023 and has been replaced with the Russell 2000 Index and S&P Healthcare Services Select Industry Index. The cumulative\ntotal return of the S&P/TSX Composite Index was 46% from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2023. As shown in the\nSummary Compensation Table below, during the same period, total compensation received by the Named Executive Officers (as\ndefined below) increased consistently with this trend. The Board considers the Corporation’s performance (including share price)\nin its compensation decision-making. Based on the growth and results of the Corporation over this period and the return to the\nCorporation's shareholders, the Board believes there is alignment between the compensation of the Named Executive Officers and\nthe return to the Corporation's shareholders. In addition, as approximately 31.3% - 47.2% of the aggregate target total direct\ncompensation of the Named Executive Officers in 2023 was security-based compensation (i.e., the grant date fair value of RSUs\nand options), in the medium to long-term, the realized compensation of the Named Executive Officers will be directly and\nmeaningfully impacted by the market value of the Common Shares of the Corporation.\nPage 38\nSummary Compensation Table\nThe table below sets forth the annual compensation paid by the Corporation during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and\n2021 (expressed in U.S. dollars) to our CEO, CFO, and our next three most highly-compensated executive officers during the year\nended December 31, 2023 (collectively, our “Named Executive Officers”).\nNonequity Nonqualified\nStock Option- Incentive Plan Deferred All Other\nSalary(1) Bonus(2) Awards(3) Awards(4) Compensation(5) Compensation Compensation(6) Total(7)\nName and Principal Position Year ($) ($) ($) ($) ($) Earnings ($) ($) ($)\nCasey Hoyt 2023 509,277 4,544 1,185,820 — 787,950 — 24,623 2,512,214\nChief Executive Officer and Director 2022 470,000 3,400 656,306 347,842 423,000 — 24,959 1,925,507\n2021 470,000 3,250 138,822 819,729 446,500 — 23,512 1,901,813\nMichael Moore 2023 429,292 4,544 797,274 — 664,350 — 54,953 1,950,413\nPresident 2022 395,000 3,400 441,259 233,868 355,500 — 54,209 1,483,236\n2021 395,000 3,250 93,336 609,492 375,250 — 51,978 1,528,306\nW.

Base salaries of our executive officers are generally set at levels deemed necessary to attract and retain individuals\nwith superior talent commensurate with their relative expertise and experience, and are set taking into consideration the executive\nofficer’s personal performance and seniority, comparability within industry norms and contribution to the Corporation’s growth\nand profitability. The Corporation believes that a competitive base salary is an imperative element of any compensation program\nthat is designed to attract talented and experienced executives. While there is no official set of benchmarks that the Corporation\nrelies on, the Corporation makes itself aware of, and is cognizant of, how comparable issuers in its business compensate their\nexecutives. The Corporation's peer group in connection with salary compensation consists of sampling of other similar sized\nhealthcare companies that are reporting issuers (or the equivalent) in Canada and the United States. The base salary for each\nexecutive officer is reviewed annually and periodically adjusted.\nShare-Based and Option Awards. An important part of our compensation program is to offer the opportunity and incentive for\nexecutives and staff to own Common Shares of the Corporation. We believe that ownership of Common Shares of the\nCorporation will align the interests of executives and future staff with the interests of the Corporation's shareholders. Share-based\nand option-based awards are not granted on a regular schedule but rather as compensation is reviewed by the Compensation\nCommittee from time to time. When reviewing awards, consideration is given to the total compensation package of the executives\nand staff and a weighting of appropriate incentives groupings at the senior, mid and junior levels of the staff, including past\ngrants. At the time of any award, consideration is also given to the available pool remaining for new positions being contemplated\nby the Corporation. See below under “Incentive Plans” for a summary of our 2020 LTIP.\nBonus Framework. The Corporation has adopted a Cash Bonus Plan and a Phantom Share Plan. See below under “Incentive\nPlans” for a summary of our Cash Bonus Plan and our Phantom Share Plan.\nRetirement Benefits. The Corporation does not currently maintain a defined benefit pension plan or a nonqualified deferred\ncompensation plan providing for retirement benefits to our Named Executive Officers. Certain of our Named Executive Officers\ncurrently participate in our 401(k) plan and are eligible for matching of up to 4%.\nGroup Benefits. The Corporation offers a group benefits plan, which includes medical benefits. The group benefits plan is\navailable to all full-time employees who choose to enroll, including officers of the Corporation.\nPerquisites and Personal Benefits. While the Corporation reimburses its Named Executive Officers for expenses incurred in the\ncourse of performing their duties as executive officers of the Corporation, it did not provide any compensation that would be\nconsidered a perquisite or personal benefit to its Named Executive Officers, other than auto allowances of $14,400 a year for Mr.\nMoore and $9,600 a year for Mr. Zehnder and a $1,200 cell phone allowance a year for each of Mr. Moore, Mr. Zehnder, Mr.\nFitzgerald and Mr. Cambre.\nEmployment Agreements\nEffective June 3, 2019, the Corporation entered into “at will” executive employment agreements with our Named Executive\nOfficers, Casey Hoyt, Michael Moore, W. Todd Zehnder, Trae Fitzgerald and Jerome Cambre. During August 2023, the\nCompensation Committee established annual base salaries of $525,300, $442,900, $442,900, $258,571, and $227,543 for Messrs.\nHoyt, Moore, Zehnder, Fitzgerald and Cambre, respectively. The agreements also provide that the executives are eligible to earn a\ndiscretionary annual cash bonus with a target bonus amount equal to 100% of annual base salary and a maximum bonus amount\nequal to 150% of annual base salary pursuant to the terms of the Cash Bonus Plan. The executives are also eligible to participate\nin any benefit plans that may be offered from time to time by the Corporation to similarly situated employees generally, subject to\nsatisfaction of the applicable eligibility provisions.\nPage 40\nIn the event the executive’s employment is terminated by the Corporation without “cause” or by the executive for “good reason,”\nthe executive will receive, subject to certain conditions, (i) severance equal to his annual base salary, payable in installments, for\n12 months following the date of termination (the “Severance Period”), (ii) an amount equal to the unpaid bonus (if any) that the\nexecutive would have earned under the Cash Bonus Plan and (iii) payment of the employer portion of the premiums required to\ncontinue the executive’s group health care coverage under the applicable provisions of COBRA, until the earliest of (A) the end of\nthe Severance Period, (B) the expiration of the executive’s eligibility for the continuation coverage under COBRA or (C) the date\nwhen the executive becomes eligible for substantially equivalent health insurance coverage in connection with new employment.\nIn the event the executive’s employment is terminated by the Corporation without “cause” or by the executive for “good reason”\nwithin 12 months of a change in control (as defined under the Cash Bonus Plan) of the Corporation, the executive will receive,\nsubject to certain conditions, the same benefits described in the previous sentence, except that the Severance Period will be\nincreased to 24 months and the bonus will instead be payable at the target bonus amount.\nIn addition, each employment agreement prohibits the executive from competing with the Corporation or soliciting its employees\nor customers during his employment and for two years after termination of the employment agreement for any reason, subject to\ncertain exceptions.\nPage 41\nOutstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End 2023\nThe following table sets forth all awards outstanding for the Named Executive Officers as of December 31, 2023:\nOption-Based Awards Stock Awards\nNumber of Securities Underlying\nUnexercised Options (#) Equity Equity\nincentive incentive\nplan plan\nawards: awards:\nNumber Market or\nMarket of pay out\nValue of unearned value of\nShares shares, unearned\nNumber of or Units units or shares,\nShares or of Stock other units or\nUnits of that have rights other\nOption Option Stock that not that have rights that\nGrant Exercise Expiration Grant have not Vested(10) not have not\nName Date Exercisable Unexercisable Price ($) Date Date Vested (#) ($) vested (#) vested ($)\n1/4/2018 134,166 (1) 0 (1) 1.81 1/4/2028 5/9/2021 4,835 (6) 37,955 — —\nCasey Hoyt\n1/17/2019 305,802 (1) 0 (1) 4.13 1/17/2029 1/18/2022 84,685 (8) 664,777\nChief Executive 1/17/2020 231,201 (1) 0 (1) 5.70 1/17/2030 1/17/2023 150,256 (9) 1,179,510\nOfficer and\nDirector 1/21/2021 108,121 (1) 54,057 (7) 8.57 1/21/2031\n1/18/2022 42,345 (1) 84,689 (8) 5.21 1/18/2032\n1/4/2018 130,539 (2) 0 (2) 1.81 1/4/2028 5/9/2021 3,251 (6) 25,520 — —\nMichael 1/17/2019 207,226 (2) 0 (2) 4.13 1/17/2029 1/18/2022 56,936 (8) 446,948\nMoore\n1/17/2020 156,673 (2) 0 (2) 5.70 1/17/2030 1/17/2023 101,023 (9) 793,031\nPresident\n1/21/2021 80,390 (2) 40,194 (7) 8.57 1/21/2031\n1/18/2022 28,470 (2) 56,940 (8) 5.21 1/18/2032\n1/4/2018 126,913 (3) 0 (3) 1.81 1/4/2028 5/9/2021 3,251 (6) 25,520 — —\nW.

None of the Named Executive\nOfficers received compensation from a non-equity incentive plan related to a period longer than one year.\nPage 43\nIncentive Plans\nCash Bonus Plan\nEffective December 28, 2017, Viemed, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, adopted an annual discretionary cash bonus plan (the\n“Cash Bonus Plan”). The purpose of the Cash Bonus Plan is to attract, motivate and retain executive management, officers and\nother employees by providing a financial incentive for employment with the Corporation and its divisions and subsidiaries and\nrewarding them for performance in line with increasing the value of the Corporation and its divisions and subsidiaries based on a\nreview of objective standards and subjective elements determined by the Compensation Committee.\nThe Compensation Committee is responsible for determining those officers and other employees of the Corporation who will\nparticipate in the Cash Bonus Plan for a particular calendar year (a “Plan Year”), and categorizing participants at different levels\nwithin the Corporation in accordance with the Cash Bonus Plan and their potential bonus as a percentage of their salary (the\n“Bonus Amount”). Such determinations are made on an annual basis prior to or within 90 days of the beginning of the Plan Year\nor within 60 days of hire for a newly hired participant.\nThe Compensation Committee determines the criteria, the weight to be given to each criterion, the minimum and maximum\nthresholds, if any, and other factors utilized by the Compensation Committee in determining whether participants will be eligible\nto receive Bonus Amounts that are target and maximum or any amount in-between based on the annual performance of the\nCorporation. Cash bonuses are awarded, in large part, when performance meets or exceeds certain objective benchmarks, but the\nCompensation Committee reserves the ability to determine Bonus Amounts based on discretionary, subjective factors as well.\nPerformance criteria under the Cash Bonus Plan include various (i) financial and operational goals (which goals are weighted at\n70%) such as adjusted EBITDA, revenue, business line growth and number of patients and (ii) other corporate goals (which goals\nare weighted at 30%) such as capital deployment opportunities, technological capabilities, internal leadership and\ncommunications, corporate governance and staffing levels. The Compensation Committee of the Board will determine the total\nannual cash bonus actually awarded to a participant after taking into consideration the foregoing, but retains sole discretion to\ndetermine the amount of the actual awarded amount. The Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may add additional\ncriterion in order to measure the overall performance of the Corporation for the purposes of making awards under the Cash Bonus\nPlan.\nNotwithstanding the achievement of the criteria, except after a Change in Control of the Corporation (as more specifically set out\nin the Cash Bonus Plan), the Compensation Committee may determine in its sole discretion to pay only a portion or pay no Bonus\nAmount for a Plan Year, including, but not limited to, if, in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee, the financial\nhealth of the Corporation or business conditions do not warrant the payment of any Bonus Amounts. Actual awarded amounts will\nbe paid in a cash lump sum as soon as possible after such awards are determined by the Compensation Committee after the end of\nthe Plan Year, but not later than 2.5 months after the end of the applicable Plan Year.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, awards in the amounts of $787,950, $664,350, $664,350, $258,571 and $227,543 were\nearned by Messrs. Hoyt, Moore, Zehnder, Fitzgerald and Cambre, respectively, under the Cash Bonus Plan.\nPhantom Share Plan\nOn April 3, 2018, Viemed, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, adopted a phantom share plan (the “Phantom Share Plan”) for the\npurpose of furthering long-term growth in earnings by offering long-term incentives to key employees of the Corporation in the\nform of phantom shares (“Phantom Shares”).\nThe Phantom Share Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to:\nselect the employees to be granted awards of Phantom Shares under the Phantom Share Plan (each a “Phantom Award” and\ncollectively, “Phantom Awards”); determine the number of Phantom Shares to be granted to each selected employee; determine\nthe time or times when Phantom Shares will be granted; determine that all participants shall be of a single class or to divide\nparticipants into different classes; determine the time or times, and the conditions, subject to which any Phantom Awards may\nbecome payable; and determine all other terms and conditions of Phantom Awards including accelerating or modifying a Phantom\nAward. The Compensation Committee also has the sole authority to interpret and construe the terms of the Phantom Share Plan,\nestablish and revise rules and regulations relating thereto and make any other determinations that it believes necessary or\nadvisable for the administration of the Phantom Share Plan. The Compensation Committee retains the complete power and\nauthority to terminate or amend the Phantom Share Plan at any time in writing in its sole discretion and make payments under the\nPhantom Share Plan.\nPage 44\nNo employee or other person has any right to be granted a Phantom Award. A Phantom Award of Phantom Shares does not entitle\nthe participant to hold or exercise any voting rights, rights to dividends or any other rights of a shareholder of the Corporation or\nany affiliate of the Corporation.\nIn the Compensation Committee’s discretion, Phantom Shares may be granted to a participant that are (i) immediately fully vested\nor (ii) subject to a vesting schedule or a performance event as specified in the participant’s Phantom Award (a “Vesting Event”).\nPhantom Awards of Phantom Shares are credited to an account (an “Account”) to be maintained for each participant. A\nparticipant only has a right to any part of his or her Phantom Shares to the extent that (1) a participant’s interest in such Phantom\nShares has vested (in accordance with the applicable Phantom Award), and (2) the rights to such Phantom Shares have not\notherwise been forfeited by the participant pursuant to the terms of the Phantom Share Plan or the applicable Phantom Award.\nPayments with respect to Phantom Shares that have vested as specifically provided in the Phantom Award will be made in a lump\nsum within 60 days of the Vesting Event in cash. No participant has any right to receive payment for any part of his or her unpaid\nPhantom Shares (vested and unvested) if the participant’s employment or other service with the Corporation is terminated for\n“cause.”\nThe total cash amount to be paid in the aggregate to a participant upon a Vesting Event is the value of the vested Phantom Shares\nin the participant’s Account on the date of the Vesting Event giving rise to the obligation to make payment calculated in\naccordance with the Phantom Share Plan. The value of one Phantom Share will be equal to the fair market value of a common\nshare on the date of a Vesting Event as defined in the participant’s Phantom Award.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, Messrs. Hoyt, Moore, Zehnder, Fitzgerald and Cambre were granted awards with a grant\ndate fair value of $239,807, $161,236, $161,236, $57,400 and $51,024, respectively, under the Phantom Share Plan.\n2020 LTIP\nOn May 3, 2020, the Board approved the 2020 LTIP which became effective on June 10, 2020 upon shareholder approval,\npursuant to which the Corporation is able to issue ͏share-͏based long-term incentives. The 2020 LTIP is administered by the\nCompensation Committee. All directors, officers, employees and consultants of the Corporation and/or its\naffiliates ͏͏͏(“Participants”) are eligible to receive awards under the 2020 LTIP, subject to the terms of the 2020 LTIP. Awards\ninclude ͏͏Common Share purchase options (“Options”), restricted stock (“Restricted Stock”), stock appreciation rights\n(“Stock A͏͏ ppreciation Rights”), performance awards (“Performance Awards”) or other stock-based awards, including restricted\nstock ͏͏units (“RSUs”) and Dividends and Dividend Equivalents (as defined below) (collectively, the “Awards”), under the 2020\nLTIP. Upon the 2020 LTIP becoming effective, no future awards or grants were made under the 2018 Option Plan or the 2018\nRSU/DSU Plan, both of which were approved at the annual and special meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation on July 17,\n2018.\nPursuant to the 2020 LTIP, the maximum number of Common ͏͏Shares that are available for Awards and issuance under the 2020\nLTIP and that may be reserved for issuance, at any time, ͏͏under the 2020 LTIP ͏and under any other security based compensation\narrangements adopted by the Corporation, including the ͏͏2018 Option Plan and the 2018 RSU/DSU Plan, shall not exceed\n7,758,211 Common Shares. The maximum amount of the ͏͏foregoing Common Shares that may be awarded under the 2020 LTIP\nas “Incentive Stock Options” (as defined in the 2020 LTIP), is 2,600,000 Common Shares.͏\nA summary and copy of the 2020 LTIP is included in the Corporation’s management information circular dated May 3, 2020, as\nfiled on SEDAR on June 11, 2020 and as Exhibit 10.12 to the Corporation’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on\nEDGAR on March 6, 2024.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, Messrs.

The\nPage 45\npayout amount that would have been made to the Named Executive Officers upon termination in the events noted in the preceding\nparagraph, if such events were to have occurred on December 31, 2023 are: Casey Hoyt ($787,950), Michael Moore ($664,350),\nW.

Phantom Awards of\nPhantom Shares made to Named Executive Officers will automatically vest on the date of a termination resulting from the death\nor disability of such Named Executive Officer.\nIn the event that a Named Executive Officer ceases to be an eligible person under the 2018 RSU/DSU Plan as a result of the\nretirement, death or total disability of the Named Executive Officer, all unvested RSUs held by such Named Executive Officer at\nthat time will automatically vest. Additionally, all RSUs held by a Named Executive Officer will automatically vest in the event\nof a termination of the Named Executive Officer by the Corporation without “cause” or a termination of the Named Executive\nOfficer or the Named Executive Officer’s resignation resulting from a material reduction or change in position, duties or\nremuneration of the Named Executive Officer at any time within 12 months after the occurrence of a change of control of the\nCorporation. The market or payout value of share based awards that have not vested as disclosed in the above table titled\n“Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End 2023” shows the incremental payments that would be made to the Named\nExecutive Officers upon termination in the events noted in the preceding paragraph, if such events were to have occurred on\nDecember 31, 2023.\nUnder the 2020 LTIP, if a Named Executive Officer’s employment is terminated as a result of death or disability, the unvested\nportion of any Award shall be forfeited and terminated and the vested ͏portion of an Option may be exercised by the Named\nExecutive Officer (or such officer’s guardian ͏or legal representative or estate) for a period of three (3) months after the date of\ntermination due to disability or one (1) year after the date of termination due to death, respectively, but in any event no later ͏than\nthe original Option expiry date͏. Upon a termination of service after a change of control of the Corporation, (i) the vested portion\nof the ͏Option, to the extent unexercised and exercisable on the date of termination, may be exercised by the Named Executive\nOfficer (or such officer’s guardian or ͏legal representative) at any time prior to the expiration of three (3) months after the date of\ntermination without “cause”, but in any event no later ͏than the original Option expiry date, and (ii) the exercisability and vesting\nof the Option or ͏other Award and any shares acquired upon the exercise thereof may otherwise be ͏accelerated effective as of the\ndate of termination, subject to the terms of the 2020 LTIP͏. The effect of a termination for “cause” shall be specified in the\napplicable Award agreement. Upon termination for any other reason (including retirement), any Award or Option, ͏to the extent\nunvested shall be forfeited by the Named Executive Officer on the date of termination, and any vested Option may be exercised\nby the ͏Named Executive Officer at any time prior to the expiration of three (3) months after the date of termination, but in any\nevent no later than the original Option expiry date͏. The Corporation may also, at its option, provide for the assumption of the 2020\nLTIP and all outstanding Awards thereunder by the surviving entity in a change of control of the Corporation.\nUnder their employment agreements, in the event the employment of any of Messrs. Hoyt, Moore, Zehnder, Fitzgerald and\nCambre is terminated by the Corporation without “cause” or by the executive for “good reason,” such terminated officer will\nreceive, subject to certain conditions, (i) severance equal to his annual base salary, payable in installments, for 12 months\nfollowing the date of termination (the “Severance Period”), (ii) an amount equal to the unpaid bonus (if any) that the terminated\nofficer would have earned under the Cash Bonus Plan and (iii) payment of the employer portion of the premiums required to\ncontinue the terminated officer’s group health care coverage under the applicable provisions of COBRA, until the earliest of (A)\nthe end of the Severance Period, (B) the expiration of the terminated officer’s eligibility for the continuation coverage under\nCOBRA or (C) the date when the terminated officer becomes eligible for substantially equivalent health insurance coverage in\nconnection with new employment. In the event the employment of any of Messrs. Hoyt, Moore, Zehnder, Fitzgerald, and Cambre\nis terminated by the Corporation without “cause” or by such officer for “good reason” within 12 months of a change in control of\nthe Corporation, the terminated officer will receive, subject to certain conditions, the same benefits described in the previous\nsentence, except that the Severance Period will be increased to 24 months and the bonus will instead be payable at the target\nbonus amount.\nIn the event that a Named Executive Officer ceases to be employed by the Corporation as a result of the death, disability or\ntermination without “cause” of such Named Executive Officer, the Board may, in its discretion, resolve that all unvested options\nheld by such Named Executive Officer under the 2018 Option Plan shall automatically vest in full. In the event of certain\ntransactions resulting in a change of control of the Corporation, the Corporation may, at its option, permit a Named Executive\nOfficer holding options under the 2018 Option Plan to exercise such options in advance of the change of control of the\nCorporation. The Corporation may also, at its option, provide for the assumption of the 2018 Option Plan and all outstanding\noptions thereunder by the surviving entity in a change of control of the Corporation.\nPage 46\nCompensation of Directors\nThe following table sets forth all compensation provided to each of the directors of the Corporation during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 (other than a director who is a Named Executive Officer, whose disclosure with respect to compensation is set\nforth above):\nFees\nEarned Non-Equity Nonqualified\nor Paid Stock Option Incentive Plan Deferred All Other\nin Cash Awards Awards(3) Compensation Compensation Compensation Total\nName Year ($) (1)(2) ($) (4) ($) ($) Earnings ($) ($) ($)\nNitin Kaushal 2023 $ 117,000 $ 85,002 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 202,002\nRandy Dobbs 2023 $ 121,625 $ 100,005 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 221,630\nTimothy Smokoff 2023 $ 119,000 $ 85,002 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 204,002\nBruce Greenstein 2023 $ 114,625 $ 85,002 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 199,627\nDr. William Frazier(5) 2023 $ — $ 28,500 $ — $ 88,032 $ — $ — $ 116,532\nSabrina Heltz 2023 $ 106,000 $ 85,002 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 191,002\n(1)The amounts shown represent the aggregate grant date fair value of restricted stock award computed at the date of the grant using the closing\nstock price on the date of the grant in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718.

The policies\nprotect the Corporation’s directors and officers against liability incurred by them while acting in their capacities as directors and\nofficers of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. The Corporation’s cost for these policies is approximately $511,000 annually.\n16. INTEREST OF INFORMED PERSONS IN MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS\nNone of the informed persons (as such term is defined in NI 51-102) of the Corporation, the proposed nominees for election as\ndirector of the Corporation, or any of their respective associates or affiliates, has had any material interest, direct or indirect, in\nany transaction of the Corporation since the commencement of the Corporation’s most recently completed financial year or in any\nproposed transaction which has materially affected or would materially affect the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries.\n17. REVIEW, APPROVAL OR RATIFICATION OF TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES\nThe Board has recognized that transactions between the Corporation and certain related persons present a heightened risk of\nconflicts of interest. To ensure that the Corporation acts in the best interests of its stockholders, the Board has delegated the\nreview and approval of related party transactions to the Audit Committee in accordance with the Audit Committee Charter. After\nits review, the Audit Committee will only approve or ratify transactions that are fair to the Corporation and not inconsistent with\nthe best interests of the Corporation and its stockholders.\nSince the beginning of the year ended December 31, 2022, there have not been, nor are there currently proposed, any transaction\nor series of similar transactions to which the Corporation was or is a party in which the amount involved exceeded or exceeds the\nlesser of $120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets at year end 2023 and 2022 and in which any of the\nCorporation’s directors, executive officers, holders of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities, or any member of the\nimmediate family of any of the foregoing persons, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.\nPage 49\n18. DELINQUENT SECTION 16(A) REPORTS\nWe are not aware of any late or delinquent filings under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.\n19. MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS\nThere are no management functions of the Corporation which are to any substantial degree performed by a person or a company\nother than the directors or executive officers of the Corporation.\n20 SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS\nUnder the Exchange Act, the deadline for submitting shareholder proposals for inclusion in the management information and\nproxy circular for an annual meeting of the Corporation is calculated in accordance with Rule 14a-8(e) of Regulation 14A to the\nExchange Act. If the proposal is submitted for a regularly scheduled annual meeting, the proposal must be received at the\nCorporation’s principal executive offices not less than 120 calendar days before the anniversary date of the Corporation’s\nmanagement information and proxy circular released to the shareholders in connection with the previous year’s annual meeting.\nHowever, if the Corporation did not hold an annual meeting the previous year, or if the date of the current year’s annual meeting\nhas been changed by more than 30 days from the date of the previous year’s annual meeting, then the deadline is a reasonable\ntime before the Corporation begins to print and mail its proxy materials. Accordingly, unless the date of the next annual meeting\nis changed by more than 30 days from the date of this year’s annual meeting the deadline for submitting shareholder proposals for\ninclusion in the management information and proxy circular for the next annual meeting of the Corporation will be December 27,\n2024.\nIn addition, there are (i) certain requirements relating to shareholder proposals contained in the BCBCA; and (ii) certain\nrequirements relating to the nomination of directors contained the Articles of the Corporation. If any person entitled to vote at an\nannual meeting wishes to propose any matter for consideration at the next annual meeting, in order for such proposal to be\nconsidered for inclusion in the materials made available to shareholders in respect of such annual meeting, such proposal must be\nreceived by the Corporation at its registered office at least three months before the anniversary date of the current year’s annual\nmeeting. Accordingly, based on the date of this year’s annual meeting, the deadline for submitting shareholder proposals for\ninclusion in the management information and proxy circular for the next annual meeting of the Corporation will be March 6,\n2025. In addition, such person must meet the definition of a “qualified shareholder” and otherwise comply with the requirements\nfor shareholder proposals set out in sections 187 to 191 of the BCBCA.\nIn addition, the Corporation’s Articles contain an advance notice requirement for director nominations (the “Advance Notice\nProvisions”) which require that advance notice be provided to the Corporation in circumstances where nominations of persons for\nelection to the Board are made by shareholders of the Corporation other than pursuant to: (i) a requisition of a meeting of\nshareholders made pursuant to the provisions of the BCBCA or (ii) a shareholder proposal made pursuant to the provisions of the\nBCBCA. Shareholders who wish to nominate candidates for election as directors must provide timely notice in writing to the\nCorporation at 625 E. Kaliste Saloom Rd., Lafayette, Louisiana 70508, Attn: Corporate Secretary. The notice must be given not\nless than 30 days and no more than 65 days prior to the date of the annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the\nannual meeting is to be held on a date that is less than 40 days after the date on which the first public announcement of the date of\nthe annual meeting was made, notice may be given not later than the close of business on the 10th day following such public\nannouncement. In the case of a special meeting of shareholders (which is not also an annual meeting) called for the purpose of\nelecting directors, notice must be given not later than the close of business on the 15th day following the day on which the\nannouncement in respect of such special meeting was made. The Advance Notice Provisions also prescribe the proper written\nform for the notice. The Board may, in its sole discretion, waive any requirement of the Advance Notice Provisions. The\nforegoing description of the Advance Notice Provisions is intended as a summary only and does not purport to be complete and is\nsubject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all of the provisions of the Articles, which contain the full text of the\nAdvance Notice Provisions, and which are available on EDGAR at www.sec.gov/edgar and SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca/. In\naddition to satisfying the requirements of the Advance Notice Provisions, including the notice deadlines set out above and therein,\nto comply with the universal proxy rules, if you intend to solicit proxies in support of director nominees, other than the\nCorporation’s nominees, you must also comply with the additional requirements of Rule 14a-19 of the Exchange Act.\nPage 50\n21. SHAREHOLDERS SHARING THE SAME ADDRESS\nThe SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and Intermediaries to satisfy the delivery requirements for shareholder meeting\nmaterials with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single set of meeting materials\naddressed to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as “householding,” potentially means extra\nconvenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies.\nA number of brokers with account holders who are shareholders of the Corporation will be “householding” the Corporation’s\nproxy materials. A single set of meeting materials will be delivered to multiple shareholders sharing an address unless contrary\ninstructions have been received from the affected shareholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be\n“householding” communications to your address, “householding” will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you\nrevoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in “householding” and would prefer to receive a separate\nset of shareholder meeting materials, please notify your broker or the Corporation. Direct your written request to 625 E. Kaliste\nSaloom Rd., Lafayette, Louisiana 70508, Attn: Corporate Secretary. Shareholders who currently receive multiple copies of\nshareholder meeting materials at their addresses and would like to request “householding” of their communications should contact\ntheir brokers.\n22. PARTICULARS OF OTHER MATTERS TO BE ACTED UPON\nOther than the foregoing, management of the Corporation knows of no other matter to come before the Meeting other than those\nreferred to in the Notice of Meeting. However, if any other matters which are not known to the management should properly come\nbefore the Meeting, the accompanying form of proxy confers discretionary authority upon the persons named therein to vote on\nsuch matters in accordance with their best judgment.\n23. ANNUAL REPORT AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nA copy of the Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Annual Report”),\nincluding the financial statements and the financial statement schedules, if any, but not including exhibits, will be furnished at no\ncharge to a shareholder upon the written request of such person addressed by mail to 625 E. Kaliste Saloom Road, Lafayette,\nLouisiana 70508, Attention: Corporate Secretary or by email to investorinfo@viemed.com.

Any statements other than statements of\nhistorical information, including those that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives,\nassumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking and may involve estimates,\nassumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-\nlooking statements. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly\nupdate or revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events\nor otherwise, except as required by applicable law.\nForward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance and reflect the expectations or beliefs of management\nregarding future events, and include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: operating results; profitability; financial\ncondition and resources; anticipated needs for working capital; liquidity; capital resources; capital expenditures; milestones;\nlicensing milestones; information with respect to future growth and growth strategies; anticipated trends in our industry; our future\nfinancing plans; timelines; currency fluctuations; government regulation; unanticipated expenses; commercial disputes or claims;\nlimitations on insurance coverage or other reimbursement; and availability of cash flow to fund capital requirements.\nOften, but not always, forward-looking information can be identified by the use of words such as “plans”, “expects”, “is expected”,\n“budget”, “potential”, “scheduled”, “estimates”, “forecasts”, “intends”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “projects”, or the negatives thereof or\nvariations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results “will”, “should”, “may”, “could”, “would”,\n“might” or “will be taken”, “occur” or “be achieved” or the negative of these terms or comparable terminology.\nForward-looking statements are based on the reasonable assumptions, estimates, analysis and opinions of management made in\nlight of its experience and its perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments, as well as other factors that\nmanagement believes to be relevant and reasonable in the circumstances at the date that such statements are made, but which\nmay prove to be incorrect. We believe that the assumptions and expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are\nreasonable. We cannot assure you, however, that such statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events\ncould differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-\nlooking statements.\nBy their nature, forward-looking statements involve numerous assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and\nspecific, including those identified under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other\ndocuments we file with the SEC and with the securities regulatory authorities in certain provinces of Canada, which contribute to\nthe possibility that the predicted outcomes may not occur or may be delayed. The risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of\nwhich are beyond our control, that could influence actual results include, but are not limited to: the general business, market and\neconomic conditions in the regions in which the we operate; significant capital requirements and operating risks that we may be\nsubject to; our ability to implement business strategies and pursue business opportunities; volatility in the market price of our\ncommon shares; the state of the capital markets; the availability of funds and resources to pursue operations; inflation; reductions\nin reimbursement rates and audits of reimbursement claims by various governmental and private payor entities; dependence on\nfew payors; possible new drug discoveries; dependence on key suppliers; granting of permits and licenses in a highly regulated\nbusiness; competition; disruptions in or attacks (including cyber-attacks) on our information technology, internet, network access or\nother voice or data communications systems or services; the evolution of various types of fraud or other criminal behavior to which\nwe are exposed; difficulty integrating newly acquired businesses; the impact of new and changes to, or application of, current laws\nand regulations; the overall difficult litigation and regulatory environment; increased competition; increased funding costs and\nmarket volatility due to market illiquidity and competition for funding; critical accounting estimates and changes to accounting\nstandards, policies, and methods used by us; our status as an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company; and\nthe occurrence of natural and unnatural catastrophic events or health epidemics or concerns, and claims resulting from such\nevents or concerns, as well as other general economic, market and business conditions; and other factors beyond our control.\nCURRENCY\nReferences in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “$”, “US$” or “U.S. dollars” are to United States dollars.

Business\nCompany Overview\nViemed Healthcare, Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"Viemed\"), through its subsidiaries, is a provider of home medical equipment (\"HME\")\nand post-acute respiratory healthcare services in the United States. The Company’s service offerings are focused on effective in-\nhome treatment with clinical practitioners providing therapy and counseling to patients in their homes using cutting edge\ntechnologies. The Company currently serves patients in all 50 states of the United States.\nViemed’s primary objective is to focus on the growth of its business and thereby solidify its position as one of the largest providers\nof home therapy for patients suffering from respiratory diseases that require a high level of service, with such programs being\ndesigned specifically for payors to have the ability to treat patients in the home for less total cost and with a superior quality of care.\nViemed's services include respiratory disease management, neuromuscular care, in-home sleep testing and sleep apnea\ntreatment, oxygen therapy, respiratory equipment rentals, and healthcare staffing services.\nViemed expects to use a growth model whereby expansion is effectuated through existing service areas as well as in new regions\nthrough a cost efficient launch that reduces location expenses. Viemed expects that it will continue to employ more respiratory\ntherapists (\"RTs\") in order to assure the high service model is accomplished in the home. By focusing overhead costs to personnel\nthat service the patient rather than physical location costs, Viemed anticipates continuing to efficiently scale its business in regions\nthat are currently not being effectively serviced.\nThe continued trend of servicing patients in the home rather than in hospitals is aligned with Viemed’s business objectives and\nmanagement anticipates that this trend will continue to offer growth opportunities for the Company. Viemed expects to continue to\nbe a solution to the rising healthcare costs in the United States by offering more cost effective home based solutions while\nincreasing the quality of life for patients fighting serious respiratory diseases.\nViemed focuses on disease management and improving the quality of life for respiratory patients through clinical excellence,\neducation and technology. Its service offerings are based on effective home treatment with respiratory care practitioners providing\ntherapy and counseling to patients in their homes using cutting edge technologies. Viemed also provides in-home sleep testing for\nsleep apnea sufferers and health care staffing services for healthcare facilities.\nViemed is one of the largest independent non-invasive ventilator providers in the United States with a service coverage area of all\n50 states of the United States and intends to continue to grow rapidly through increased market penetration.\nCorporate Information\nViemed Healthcare, Inc. is a holding company incorporated in British Columbia under the Business Corporations Act in December\n2016. The common shares of Viemed trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the trading symbol \"VMD\". Viemed’s registered\nand records office is located at Suite 2800, Park Place, 666 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia V6C 2Z7 Canada and its\nprincipal executive office is located at 625 E. Kaliste Saloom Road, Lafayette, Louisiana 70508.\nCopies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to\nthose reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n\"Exchange Act\"), are available free of charge through our website (www.viemed.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after we\nelectronically file the material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports and other information\nare also available, free of charge, at www.sec.gov. Information contained on any website referred to in this Annual Report on Form\n10-K is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPage 5\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nProducts and Services\nViemed’s services include the following:\n• Home Medical Equipment: Viemed provides respiratory and other home medical equipment solutions (primarily through\nmonthly rental arrangements), including home ventilation (invasive and non-invasive), BiPAP (bi-level positive airway\npressure) and CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) devices, percussion vests, oxygen concentrators, and other\nmedical equipment. Revenue derived from the rental and sale of home medical equipment represented a combined 94.2%\nand 93.8%, respectively, of Viemed’s 2023 and 2022 traditional revenue, excluding COVID-19 response sales and\nservices. Viemed provides home medical equipment through the following service programs:\n◦ Respiratory disease management, including treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (“COPD”),\naims to improve quality of life and reduce hospital readmissions by using proven methodology and leading\ntechnologies, such as non-invasive ventilation (“NIV”), percussion vests, and other therapies. Viemed provides\nventilation (both invasive and non-invasive) and related equipment and supplies to patients suffering from COPD\nthrough a high-touch model.\n◦ Neuromuscular care is focused on helping neuromuscular patients breathe more comfortably while living an\nactive, healthier life and uses respiratory therapy treatments which can lessen the effort required to breathe.\n◦ Oxygen therapy provides patients with extra oxygen, which is sometimes used to manage certain chronic health\nproblems, including COPD. Oxygen therapy may be performed in the home or in another setting.\n◦ Sleep apnea management provides sleep solutions and/or equipment such as Positive Airway Pressure (“PAP”),\nthe AutoPAP (automatic continuous positive airway pressure), and BiPAP machines.\n• In-home sleep testing: Viemed provides in home sleep apnea testing services, which is an alternative to the traditional\nsleep lab testing environment.\n• Healthcare staffing: Viemed provides healthcare staffing and recruitment services to supplement the workforce needs of\nthird party healthcare facilities by utilizing its network of healthcare professionals.\nMonthly rental revenue from ventilators represented approximately 59% and 68%, respectively, of Viemed's 2023 and 2022\ntraditional revenue, excluding COVID-19 response sales and services. While Viemed plans to continue investigating and\nintroducing new complementary products and services and further expanding the coverage of existing products, home ventilation\n(both invasive and non-invasive) is expected to continue to represent the substantial majority of Viemed’s revenue.\nPatients suffering from neuromuscular or respiratory diseases experience severe difficulty in breathing and require assistance from\na ventilator to effectively move air in and out of their lungs. Invasive and non-invasive ventilation differ in how the air is delivered to\nthe person. Invasive ventilation delivers air via a tube inserted into the windpipe. Non-invasive ventilation delivers air through a\nsealed mask that can be placed over the mouth.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual stipulates that\nventilators are covered for the treatment of conditions associated with neuromuscular diseases, thoracic restrictive diseases, and\nchronic respiratory failure consequent to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Ventilators are also included in Medicare’s\nFrequently & Substantially Serviced payment category and are reimbursed under the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding\nSystem (“HCPCS”) codes E0465 (invasive ventilation), E0466 (non-invasive ventilation) and E0467 (multi-function ventilation).\nViemed’s patients are served by RTs who are each licensed members of the American Association for Respiratory Care (“AARC”).\nThe RT licensure and AARC membership ensure that Viemed is able to provide patients with in-home respiratory care services,\nequipment setup, training, and on-call services with state-of-the-art clinical protocols. Additionally, Viemed’s Chief Medical Officer,\nDr. William Frazier, is a board certified pulmonary disease specialist and oversees clinical protocols.\nViemed sources hardware from vendors and pairs them with industry leading respiratory therapy. The emerging nature of the\nmarket presents risks that vendors may not be able to provide equipment to satisfy demand. Viemed has historically funded patient\nrelated capital expenditures through cash generated from operations or financing through an affiliate of its primary vendors.\nAdditionally, Viemed patient related capital expenditures can be financed through its existing commercial credit facilities comprised\nof a revolving credit facility of up to $30.0 million, a delayed draw term loan facility of up to $30 million, and an accordion feature\nallowing the Company to increase the size of such facilities by up to an additional $30 million, subject to certain conditions, for a\ntotal borrowing capacity of up to $90 million.\nPage 6\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation, including numerous laws directed at regulating reimbursement of our products\nand services under various government and commercial programs and preventing fraud and abuse, as more fully described below.\nWe maintain certain safeguards intended to reduce the likelihood that we will engage in conduct or enter into arrangements in\nviolation of these restrictions. Federal and state laws require that we obtain facility and other regulatory licenses and that we enroll\nas a supplier with federal and state health programs. Notwithstanding these measures, due to changes in and new interpretations\nof such laws and regulations, and changes in our business, among other factors, violations of these laws and regulations may still\noccur, which could subject us to: civil and criminal enforcement actions; licensure revocation, suspension, or non-renewal; severe\nfines and penalties; and even the termination of our ability to provide services, including those provided under certain government\nprograms such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services\nCMS requires providers of products or services to attain and maintain accreditation in order to participate in federally funded\nhealthcare programs. To attain and maintain accreditation, companies are required to institute policies and procedures that, among\nother things, formalize the interaction of the company with patients. Accrediting bodies that are approved by CMS will perform\naudits of these policies and procedures every three years. Should a company fall out of compliance with the requirements of the\naccrediting body, expulsion from the Medicare program could follow. In December 2008, we became a Durable, Medical\nEquipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies accredited Medicare supplier by the Accreditation Commission for Health Care for\nour solutions. Our Medicare accreditation must be renewed every three years through passage of an on-site inspection. We last\nrenewed our accreditation with Medicare in August 2021. Maintaining our accreditation and Medicare enrollment requires that we\ncomply with numerous business and customer support standards. If we are found to be out of compliance with accreditation\nstandards, our enrollment status in the Medicare program could be jeopardized, up to and including termination.\nCMS also requires that all durable medical equipment (\"DME\") providers who bill the Medicare program maintain a surety bond of\n$50,000 per National Provider Identifier (“NPI”) number which Medicare has approved for billing privileges. We obtained surety\nbonds before the October 2009 deadline, and such bonds automatically renew annually.\nIn order to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries only receive medically necessary and appropriate items and services, the Medicare\nprogram has adopted a number of documentation requirements. For example, the DME Medicare Administrative Contractor\n(“MAC”) Supplier Manuals provide that clinical information from the “patient’s medical record” is required to justify the initial and\nongoing medical necessity for the provision of DME. Some DME MACs, CMS staff and government subcontractors have taken the\nposition, among other things, that the “patient’s medical record” refers not to documentation maintained by the DME supplier but\ninstead to documentation maintained by the patient’s physician, healthcare facility or other clinician, and that clinical information\ncreated by the DME supplier’s personnel and confirmed by the patient’s physician is not sufficient to establish medical necessity. It\nmay be difficult, and sometimes impossible, for us to obtain documentation from other healthcare providers. Moreover, auditors’\ninterpretations of these policies are inconsistent and subject to individual interpretation. This is then translated to individual supplier\nerror rates and aggregated into a Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (“DMEPOS”) industry error rate,\nwhich is significantly higher than other Medicare provider/supplier types. High error rates lead to further audit activity and regulatory\nburdens. DME MACs continue to conduct extensive pre-payment and post-payment reviews across the DME industry and have\ndetermined a wide range of error rates. DME MACs have repeatedly cited documentation insufficiencies as the primary reason for\nclaim denials. If these or other burdensome positions are generally adopted by auditors, DME MACs, other contractors or CMS in\nadministering the Medicare program, we would have the right to challenge these positions as being contrary to law. If these\ninterpretations of the documentation requirements are ultimately upheld, however, it could result in our making significant refunds\nand other payments to Medicare and our future revenues from Medicare may be significantly reduced. We have adjusted certain\noperational policies to address the current expectations of Medicare and its contractors. We cannot predict the adverse impact, if\nany, these interpretations of the Medicare documentation requirements or our revised policies might have on our operations, cash\nflow, and capital resources, but such impact could be material.\nCMS maintains a Master List of Items Frequently Subject to Unnecessary Utilization. This list identifies items that could potentially\nbe subject to prior authorization as a condition of Medicare payment. CMS has added home ventilators used with a non-invasive\ninterface to the Master List of Items Frequently Subject to Unnecessary Utilization. If CMS requires prior authorization requirements\nfor noninvasive home ventilation, it could materially impact our business.\nPage 7\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nCompetitive Bidding Process\nThe Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 required the Secretary of Health and Human\nServices (\"HHS\") to establish and implement programs under which competitive acquisition areas are established throughout the\nUnited States for purposes of awarding contracts for the furnishing of competitively priced items of durable medical equipment.\nCMS conducts a competition for each competitive acquisition area under which providers submit bids to supply certain covered\nitems of DME. Under the competitive bidding program, DME suppliers compete to become Medicare contract suppliers by\nsubmitting bids to furnish certain items in competitive bidding areas. As part of the competitive bidding process, single payment\namounts (“SPAs”) replace the current Medicare DME fee schedule payment amounts for selected items in certain areas of the\ncountry. The SPAs are determined by using bids submitted by DME suppliers. In 2019, CMS included non-invasive ventilator\nproducts on the list of products subject to the competitive bidding program in Round 2021. On March 9, 2020, CMS announced that\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States President's exercise of the Defense Production Act, public concern regarding\naccess to ventilators, and the non-invasive ventilators product category being new to the competitive bidding program, non-invasive\nventilators were removed as a product category from Round 2021. On October 27, 2020, CMS announced that it had removed 13\nof the 15 remaining product categories from Round 2021, including oxygen and PAP devices, because the payment amounts did\nnot achieve expected savings. As a result of these announcements, we retain the ability to continue to furnish non-invasive\nventilators and oxygen and PAP devices for all of our Medicare accredited areas. However, we are uncertain if non-invasive\nventilators and oxygen and PAP devices will be included in future competitive bidding programs. The current Round 2021 contracts\nexpired on December 31, 2023 and CMS has not announced a new round of competitive bidding. Historically, CMS announces\nnew rounds of competitive bidding and starts the process approximately 18 months prior to the contract start date. We cannot\npredict the outcome of the competitive bidding process for contracted supplier selection or the impact of the competitive bidding\nprocess on reimbursements to our existing customers.\nLicensure\nSeveral states require that DME providers be licensed in order to sell products to patients in that state. Certain of these states\nrequire that durable medical equipment providers maintain an in-state location. Most of our state licenses are renewed on an\nannual basis. Although we believe we are in compliance with all applicable state regulations regarding licensure requirements, if we\nwere found to be noncompliant, we could lose our licensure in that state, which could prohibit us from selling our current or future\nproducts to patients in that state. In addition, we are subject to certain state laws regarding professional licensure.\nAccreditation\nMany payors require accreditation under payor contracts. If we lose accreditation at any location, it could have an adverse impact\non our reimbursement under payor contracts.\nFraud and Abuse Regulations\nFederal Anti-Kickback and Self-Referral Laws. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, among other things, prohibits the knowing\nand willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration, whether directly or indirectly and overtly or covertly, in\nreturn for, or to induce the referral of an individual for the:\n• furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable in whole or in part under Medicare, Medicaid or\nother federal healthcare programs; or\n• purchase, lease, or order of, or the arrangement or recommendation of the purchasing, leasing, or ordering of any item or\nservice reimbursable in whole or in part under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs.\nThere are a number of narrow safe harbors to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Such safe harbors permit certain payments and\nbusiness practices that, although they would otherwise potentially implicate the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, are not treated as an\noffense under the same if all of the requirements of the specific applicable safe harbor are met.\nThe Federal Anti-Kickback Statute applies to certain arrangements with healthcare providers, product end users and other parties,\nincluding marketing arrangements and discounts and other financial incentives offered in connection with the sales of our products.\nAlthough we believe that we have structured such arrangements to be in compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute and other\napplicable laws, regulatory authorities may determine that our marketing, pricing, or other activities violate the Federal Anti-\nKickback Statute or other applicable laws. Noncompliance with the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in civil, administrative\nand/or criminal penalties, restrictions on our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions, and exclusion from participation in Medicare,\nMedicaid or other federal healthcare programs. In addition, to the extent we are found to not be in compliance, we may be required\nto curtail or restructure our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, exclusions, curtailment or restructuring of our operations\ncould adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nPage 8\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe Ethics in Patient Referrals Act, commonly known as the “Stark Law,” prohibits a physician from making referrals for certain\n“designated health services” payable by Medicare to an entity, including a company that furnishes DME, in which the physician or\nan immediate family member of such physician has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician has entered\ninto a compensation arrangement, unless a statutory exception applies. Violation of the Stark Law could result in denial of\npayment, disgorgement of reimbursements received under a noncompliance arrangement, civil penalties, damages and exclusion\nfrom Medicare or other governmental programs. Although we believe that we have structured our provider arrangements to comply\nwith current Stark Law requirements, these requirements are highly technical and there can be no guarantee that regulatory\nauthorities will not determine or assert that our arrangements are in violation of the Stark Law and do not otherwise meet applicable\nStark Law exceptions.\nAdditionally, because some of these laws continue to evolve, we lack definitive guidance as to the application of certain key\naspects of these laws as they relate to our arrangements with providers with respect to patient training. We cannot predict the final\nform that these regulations will take or the effect that the final regulations will have on us. As a result, our provider arrangements\nmay ultimately be found to be noncompliant with applicable federal law.\nFalse statements. The federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or omitting a material\nfact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of healthcare benefits, items, or services. In addition to\ncriminal penalties, violation of this statute may result in collateral administrative sanctions, including exclusion from participation in\nMedicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs.\nFederal False Claims Act and Civil Monetary Penalties Law. The Federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) provides, in part, that the\nfederal government or a private party on behalf of the government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has\nknowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who\nhas made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim paid or to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money\nto the federal government or who has knowingly retained an overpayment. In addition, amendments in 1986 to the Federal False\nClaims Act have made it easier for private parties to bring whistleblower lawsuits against companies. Further, on June 1, 2023, the\nUnited States Supreme Court issued a decision further clarifying the meaning of “knowingly” presenting a false claim for purposes\nof the FCA. This decision places newfound emphasis on the subjective beliefs of the person or entity making the claim, which may\ninvite closer scrutiny of health care providers’ subjective beliefs as to the compliance of claims submitted to governmental\nhealthcare programs.\nThe Civil Monetary Penalties Law provides, in part, that the federal government may seek civil monetary penalties against any\nperson who presents or causes to be presented claims to a Federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is\nfor an item or services that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent, or the person has made a false statement or used\na false record to get a claim paid. The federal government may also seek civil monetary penalties for a wide variety of other\nconduct, including offering remuneration to influence a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary’s selection of providers and violations of\nthe Federal Anti-Kickback Statute.\nAlthough we believe that we are in compliance with the Federal False Claims Act as well as the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, if we\nare found in violation of the same, we could be subject to various liabilities and penalties, including fines ranging from $13,946 to\n$27,894 for each false claim in violation of the Federal False Claims Act (as of 2023, and subject to annual adjustments for\ninflation) and varying amounts based on the type of violation of the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, plus up to three times the amount\nof damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person. In addition, the federal government may also\nseek exclusion from participation in all federal healthcare programs.\nIn addition, we bill Medicare Part B and other insurers directly for each sale to patients. As a result, we must comply with all laws,\nrules and regulations associated with filing claims with the Medicare program, including the Social Security Act, Medicare\nregulations, the Federal False Claims Act and the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, as well as a variety of additional federal and state\nlaws. During an audit, insurers typically expect to find explicit documentation in the medical record to support a claim. Physicians\nand other clinicians, who are responsible for prescribing our products for patients, are expected to create and maintain the medical\nrecords that form the basis for the claims we submit to Medicare and other insurers. Any failure by physicians and other clinicians\nto properly document the medical records for patients using our products could invalidate claims, impair our ability to collect\nsubmitted claims and subject us to overpayment liabilities, Federal False Claims Act liabilities and other penalties including\nexclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid or private insurance programs.\nTo the extent we are found to not be in compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations, we may be required to\ncurtail or restructure our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, exclusions, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could\nadversely affect our ability to operate our business, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nPage 9\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nState fraud and abuse provisions. Many states have also adopted some form of anti-kickback and anti-referral laws and false\nclaims acts that apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs.\nIn some states, these laws apply and we believe that we are in compliance with such laws. Nevertheless, a determination of liability\nunder such laws could result in fines and penalties, as well as restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Other Anti-Corruption Laws. We may be subject to a variety of domestic and\nforeign anti-corruption laws with respect to our regulatory compliance efforts and operations. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices\nAct (the “FCPA”) is a criminal statute that prohibits an individual or business from paying, offering, promising or authorizing the\nprovision of money (such as a bribe or kickback) or anything else of value (such as an improper gift, hospitality, or favor), directly or\nindirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision in order to assist the\nindividual or business in obtaining, retaining, or directing business or other advantages (such as favorable regulatory rulings). The\nFCPA also obligates companies with securities listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions. Those\nprovisions require a company such as ours to (i) maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions,\nexpenses and asset dispositions, and (ii) devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls sufficient to\nprovide reasonable assurances that transactions are properly authorized, executed and recorded. The FCPA is subject to broad\ninterpretation by the U.S. government. The past decade has seen a significant increase in enforcement activity. In addition to the\nFCPA, there are a number of other federal and state anti-corruption laws to which we may be subject, including, the U.S. domestic\nbribery statute contained in 18 USC § 201 (which prohibits bribing U.S. government officials) and the U.S. Travel Act (which in\nsome instances addresses private-sector or commercial bribery both within and outside the United States).\nWe could be held liable under the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws for the illegal activities of our employees, representatives,\ncontractors, collaborators, agents, subsidiaries, or affiliates, even if we did not explicitly authorize such activity. Although we will\nseek to comply with anti-corruption laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, representatives, contractors,\ncollaborators, agents, subsidiaries or affiliates will comply with these laws at all times. Violation of these laws could subject us to\nwhistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits,\nsignificant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and/or debarment from contracting with\ncertain governments or other persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage and other collateral\nconsequences. In addition, our directors, officers, employees, and other representatives who engage in violations of the FCPA and\ncertain other anti-corruption statutes may face imprisonment, fines and penalties. If any subpoenas or investigations are launched,\nor governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a\nmaterially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nEnforcement actions and sanctions could further harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHIPAA. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) established uniform standards governing the\nconduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of individually identifiable health\ninformation maintained or transmitted by healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses (collectively “covered\nentities”). The following standards have been promulgated under HIPAA’s regulations:\n• the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, which restrict the use and disclosure of\nindividually identifiable health information, or “protected health information”;\n• the Standards for Electronic Transactions, which establish standards for common healthcare transactions, such as claims\ninformation, plan eligibility, payment information and the use of electronic signatures;\n• the Security Standards, which require covered entities to implement and maintain certain security measures to safeguard\ncertain electronic health information, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect\nsuch information; and\n• the breach notification rules, which require covered entitles to provide notification to affected individuals, the HHS and the\nmedia in the event of a breach of unsecured protected health information.\nPage 10\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nIn 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) which included sweeping changes to\nHIPAA, including an expansion of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards. ARRA includes the Health Information Technology for\nEconomic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”) which, among other things, made HIPAA’s privacy and security standards\ndirectly applicable to business associates of covered entities. A business associate is a person or entity that performs certain\nfunctions or activities on behalf of a covered entity that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information. As a result,\nbusiness associates are now subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with applicable standards.\nMoreover, HITECH creates a new requirement to report certain breaches of unsecured, individually identifiable health information\nand imposes penalties on entities that fail to do so. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed\nagainst covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil\nactions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney fees and costs associated\nwith pursuing federal civil actions.\nThe 2013 final HITECH omnibus rule (the “HITECH Final Rule”) modifies the breach reporting standard in a manner that makes\nmore data security incidents qualify as reportable breaches. Any liability from a failure to comply with the requirements of HIPAA or\nthe HITECH Act could adversely affect our financial condition. The costs of complying with privacy and security related legal and\nregulatory requirements are burdensome and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The HITECH Final\nRule will continue to be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially\ncomplex compliance issues for us, as well as referring providers.\nIn addition to federal regulations issued under HIPAA, some states have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations that,\nin certain cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA. In those cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned\noperations and procedures to comply with the more stringent state laws. Most states have also adopted breach notification laws\nthat require notification to affected individuals and certain state agencies if there is a security breach of certain individually-\nidentifiable information. If we suffer a privacy or security breach, we could be required to expend significant resources to provide\nnotification to the affected individuals and address the breach, as well as reputational harm associated with the breach. If we fail to\ncomply with applicable state laws and regulations, we could be subject to additional sanctions. Any liability from failure to comply\nwith the requirements of HIPAA, HITECH or state privacy and security statutes or regulations could adversely affect our financial\ncondition. The costs of complying with privacy and security related legal and regulatory requirements are burdensome and could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral Regulatory Compliance and Health Care Reform\nThe evolving regulatory and compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different\ncompliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply\nfully with one or more of these requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws\ndescribed above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and\ncivil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government\nhealthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings and\nthe curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, financial\ncondition and our results of operations.\nIn March 2010, the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) was enacted into law in the United States. This healthcare reform, which included a\nnumber of provisions aimed at improving the quality and decreasing the cost of healthcare, has resulted in significant\nreimbursement cuts in Medicare payments to hospitals and other healthcare providers in the healthcare reimbursement system,\nevolving toward value- and outcomes-based reimbursement methodologies. It is uncertain what long-term consequences these\nprovisions will have on patient access to new technologies and what impact these provisions will have on Medicare reimbursement\nrates. Other elements of the ACA, including comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board and\npayment systems reform, including shared savings pilots and other reforms, may result in fundamental changes to federal\nhealthcare reimbursement programs. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"TCJA\") repealed penalties for noncompliance with the\nrequirement for insurance coverage known as the “individual mandate.” This change could affect whether individuals enroll in\nhealth plans and could impact insurers with which we contract. Other changes to the ACA could impact the number of patients who\nhave access to our products. Existing and additional legislative or administrative reforms, or any repeal of provisions, of the U.S.\nhealthcare reimbursement systems may significantly reduce reimbursement or otherwise impact coverage for our medical devices,\nor adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of such systems in coverage or reimbursement issues could have\nan adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nPage 11\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nThird-Party Reimbursement\nIn the United States and elsewhere, sales of medical devices depend in significant part on the availability of coverage and\nreimbursement to providers and patients from third-party payors. Third-party payors include private insurance plans and\ngovernmental programs. As with other medical devices, reimbursement for our products can differ significantly from payor to payor,\nand our products are not universally covered by third-party commercial payors. Further, third-party payors continually review\nexisting technologies for continued coverage and can, with limited notice, deny or reverse coverage for existing products.\nTwo principal governmental third-party payors in the United States are Medicare and Medicaid. Medicare is a federal program that\nprovides certain medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, certain disabled persons and others. In contrast, Medicaid\nis a medical assistance program jointly funded by federal and state governments to serve certain individuals and families with low\nincomes and who meet other eligibility requirements. Each state administers its own Medicaid program which determines the\nbenefits made available to the Medicaid recipients in that state. The Medicare and Medicaid statutory framework is subject to\nadministrative rulings, interpretations and discretion that affect the amount and timing of reimbursement made under Medicare and\nMedicaid.\nCMS, which is the agency within the HHS that administers both Medicare and Medicaid, has the authority to decline to cover\nparticular products or services if it determines that they are not “reasonable and necessary” for the treatment of Medicare\nbeneficiaries. A coverage determination for a product, which establishes the indications that will be covered, and any restrictions or\nlimitations, can be developed at the national level by CMS through a National Coverage Determination (“NCD”) or at the local level\nthrough a Local Coverage Determination (“LCD”) by a regional DME MAC. CMS could issue new NCDs or the regional DME MACs\ncould issue LCDs related to a full range of respiratory DME products. If such NCDs or LCDs are issued or revised, they could\nsignificantly alter the coverage under Medicare and materially impact our business.\nWith respect to our ventilator products, an NCD for the DME Reference List, which has been effective since April 1, 2003, indicates\nthat ventilators, including our products, are covered for the treatment of neuromuscular diseases, thoracic restrictive diseases, and\nchronic respiratory failure consequent to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. While the NCD for the DME Reference List has\nbeen updated, no separate NCD has been issued for ventilators. Monthly rental revenue from ventilators represented\napproximately 59% and 68%, respectively, of traditional revenue, excluding COVID-19 response sales and services, for 2023 and\n2022. Medicare Administrative Contractors responsible for processing durable medical equipment claims have issued LCDs for\nRespiratory Assist Devices (“RADs”) which contain language describing an overlap in conditions used to determine coverage for\nRADs and ventilator devices. These LCDs state that the treatment plan for any individual patient, including the determination to use\na ventilator or a BiPAP, may vary and will be made based upon the specifics of each individual beneficiary’s medical condition. Due\nto this variability, determinations of coverage for our ventilator products are subject to scrutiny of individual medical records and\nclaims. Revenues from Medicare and Medicaid accounted for 46% and 56%, respectively, of traditional revenue, excluding\nCOVID-19 response sales and services, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nBecause Medicare criteria is extensive, we have a team dedicated to educating prescribers to help them understand how Medicare\npolicy affects their patients and the medical record documentation needed to meet both NCD and LCD requirements. We maintain\nopen communication with physician key opinion leaders and with Medicare Administrative Contractors to provide data as it\nbecomes available that could potentially influence coverage decisions. We also continue to closely monitor our Medicare business\nto identify trends that could have a negative impact on certain Medicare patients’ access to our products, which in turn could have\nan adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCommercial payors that reimburse for our products do so in a variety of ways, depending on the insurance plan’s policies,\nemployer and benefit manager input, and contracts with their provider network. Moreover, Medicaid programs and some\ncommercial insurance plans, especially Medicare Advantage plans (commercial insurers that are administering Medicare benefits\nto certain beneficiaries), are frequently influenced by Medicare coverage determinations. In working with payors who follow\nMedicare criteria, we have focused on clear communications with insurers to ensure mutual understanding of criteria interpretation,\nwhich differs significantly among the plans from very restrictive to quite lenient, and we then work closely with prescribers to\neducate them accordingly. While this approach has had positive impact, we do not know if or when additional payors may adopt the\nLCD criteria nor do we know how they will choose to interpret it.\nWe believe a reduction or elimination of coverage or reimbursement of our products by Medicare would likely cause some\ncommercial third-party payors to implement similar reductions in their coverage or reimbursement of our products. If we are unable\nto expand coverage of our products by additional commercial payors, or if third-party payors that currently cover or reimburse for\nour products reverse or limit their coverage in the future, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nPage 12\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”). For as long as we\nare an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are\napplicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to\ncomply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations\nregarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding\nadvisory “say-on-pay” votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation. We\nwill remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of (i) the last day of our fiscal year in which we have total annual gross\nrevenues of $1.07 billion (as such amount is indexed for inflation every five years by the SEC to reflect the change in the Consumer\nPrice Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, setting the threshold to the nearest $1 million) or\nmore; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of common equity securities\npursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”); (iii) the date on\nwhich we have, during the prior three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; and (iv) the date on which\nwe are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the Exchange Act.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common shares less attractive to the extent we rely on the exemptions available to\nemerging growth companies. If some investors find our common shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active\ntrading market for our common shares and our share price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended\ntransition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An\nemerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise\napply to private companies. We may choose to take advantage of such extended transition period.\nCompetition\nThe respiratory care industry is highly competitive. While Viemed is one of the top providers of NIV and related services in the\nUnited States, its current competitors may gain market share, and any new entrants, with greater financial and technical resources,\nmay provide additional competition. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that Viemed will be able to grow its operations\norganically to meet the competitive environment.\nSignificant Customers\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Viemed had no customers that accounted for 10% or more of its consolidated\nrevenue streams.\nViemed earns revenues by seeking reimbursement from Medicare and private health insurance companies, with the Medicare\nprogram of the United States government being the primary entity making payments. If the Medicare program were to slow\npayments of Viemed receivables for any reason, Viemed would be adversely impacted.\nA majority of the Company’s revenues are derived from the fee-for-service pricing guidelines set by CMS. These pricing guidelines\nare subject to change at the discretion of CMS.\nEmployees\nAt December 31, 2023, Viemed had 996 permanent employees, in addition to temporary employees and independent contractors\nengaged through the Company's healthcare staffing and recruitment services to supplement the workforce needs of third party\nhealthcare facilities.\nPage 13\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Business\nWe compete against companies that have longer operating histories and greater resources, which may result in reduced\nprofit margins and loss of market share.\nThe respiratory care industry is highly competitive and dynamic and may become more competitive as new players enter the\nmarket. Certain competitors will be subsidiaries or divisions of larger, much better capitalized companies. Certain competitors will\nhave vertically integrated manufacturing and services sectors of the market. We may have less capital and may encounter greater\noperational challenges in serving the market. Better capitalized competitors may also be able to borrow money or raise debt to\npurchase equipment more easily than us. Potential competitors could have significantly greater financial, research and\ndevelopment, manufacturing, and sales and marketing resources than we have and could utilize their greater resources to acquire\nor develop new technologies or products that could effectively compete with our existing products. Additionally, demand for our\nhome monitoring services and other services could be diminished by equivalent or superior products and services developed by\ncompetitors. Competing in these markets could result in price-cutting, reduced profit margins and loss of market share, any of\nwhich would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nReductions in reimbursement rates may have a materially adverse impact on the profitability of our operations.\nReimbursement for our services primarily comes from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and\nprivate health insurance companies, and our ability to sell our products and services depends in large part on the extent to which\ncoverage and adequate reimbursement for our products and services are and will continue to be available. The reimbursement\nrates offered are outside of our control. The CARES Act previously introduced a blended rate for HME furnished in non-rural or\ncontiguous non-competitive bidding areas that is based on 75% of the adjusted fee schedule amount and 25% of the unadjusted\nfee schedule amount. The 75/25 blended Medicare reimbursement rate expired on December 31, 2023, reverting to rates in place\nprior to the implementation of the 75/25 blend, adjusted for inflation. This change may lead to reduced reimbursement for\ncompetitive bid products and services in specific markets where we operate.\nReimbursement rates for our services, like much of the United States healthcare market, are subject to reductions. We cannot\npredict the extent and timing of any reduction in reimbursement rates and we cannot assure you that coverage and reimbursement\nwill be available for our products or services, that reimbursement amounts will be adequate, or that reimbursement amounts, even\nif initially adequate, will not be subsequently reduced.\nReductions in reimbursement rates, if they occur, may have a material adverse impact on the profitability of our operations. A\nreduction in reimbursement without a concurrent decline in the cost of operations, may result in reduced profitability. Our costs of\noperations could increase, but we may be unable to pass on the cost increases to customers because reimbursement rates are set\nwithout regard to the cost of service, also resulting in reduced profitability.\nOur reliance on only a few sources of reimbursement for our services could result in delays in reimbursement, which\ncould adversely affect cash flow and revenues.\nWe earn revenues by seeking reimbursement for our products and services from governmental healthcare programs and private\nhealth insurance companies, primarily from the federal Medicare program. If the Medicare program were to slow payments of our\nreceivables for any reason, we would be adversely impacted. In addition, both governmental healthcare programs and private\nhealth insurance companies may seek ways to avoid or delay reimbursement, which could adversely affect our cash flow and\nrevenues.\nPage 14\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nOur dependence on key suppliers puts us at risk of interruptions in the availability of the equipment we need for our\nservices, which could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe require the timely delivery of a sufficient supply of equipment we use to perform our home treatment of patients. Our\ndependence on third-party suppliers involves several additional risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality and\ndelivery schedules. In addition, there are a limited number of manufacturers of the equipment used for home treatment of patients\nwith ventilation respiratory therapy, which has been further exacerbated by Philips Respironics' January 2024 decision to\ndiscontinue of many of its respiratory products. Dependence on only a few manufacturers presents risks that suppliers may not be\nable to provide or adequately provide sufficient equipment to satisfy demand. Demand may also outstrip supply, leading to\nequipment shortages that could adversely affect our operations. Inadequate supply could also impair our ability to attract new\nbusiness and could create upward pricing pressure on equipment and supplies, adversely affecting our margins. Conversely,\nincorrect demand forecasting could lead to excess inventory, which we may not be able to sell. If we fail to achieve certain volume\nof sales, prices of ventilators may increase, leading to reduced revenue and profitability. The industry is subject to a high level of\nregulatory scrutiny, and government or manufacturer recalls could adversely affect our ability to provide products and services and\nachieve revenue targets. Additionally, the market for financing ventilators and other supplies we need could be more difficult in the\nfuture.\nOn June 14, 2021, Royal Philips (“Philips”), one of our largest suppliers of BiPAP and CPAP and mechanical ventilator devices,\ninitiated a voluntary recall notification with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for certain Philips BiPAP and CPAP and\nmechanical ventilator devices that we distribute and sell. Philips initiated this recall to address potential health risks related to the\npolyester-based polyurethane (“PE-PUR”) sound abatement foam component in these devices. The PE-PUR sound abatement\nfoam, which is used to reduce sound and vibration in these affected devices, may break down and potentially enter the device’s air\npathway and may off-gas certain chemicals. If this occurs, black debris from the foam or certain chemicals released into the\ndevice’s air pathway may be inhaled or swallowed by the person using the device. In July 2021, the FDA identified the Philips recall\nas a Class I recall, the most serious type of recall. Patients using these devices have been instructed to contact their health care\nprovider and doctor about a suitable treatment for their condition. As of December 2023, Philips has announced remediation of\n99% of actionable sleep therapy device registrations.\nWe cannot predict the potential legal, regulatory, and financial risks that may arise out of the recall. For example, we may be asked\nto notify patients of the recall, retrieve recalled devices from patients, and/or provide replacement devices, resulting in additional\nunreimbursed costs. Some patients may discontinue use of their device, which could affect our ability to continue billing for service.\nViemed has been named in and may be subject to future litigation related to the recall, including individual and putative class action\nclaims related to personal injury for devices affected by the recall as well as claims regarding repair and replacement of devices\naffected by the recall. Viemed cannot predict what additional actions will be required of the Company by the FDA or other state or\nfederal agencies related to the recall.\nWe conduct all of our operations through our United States subsidiaries and our ability to extract value from these\nsubsidiaries may be limited.\nWe conduct all of our operations through our United States subsidiaries. Therefore, to the extent of these holdings, we (directly and\nindirectly) will be dependent on the cash flows of these subsidiaries to meet our obligations. The ability of such subsidiaries to\nmake payments to their parent companies may be constrained by a variety of factors, including, the level of taxation, particularly\ncorporate profits and withholding taxes, in the jurisdiction in which each subsidiary operates, and the introduction of exchange\ncontrols or repatriation restrictions or the availability of hard currency to be repatriated. Additionally, our subsidiaries are restricted\nfrom making distributions to us by our existing commercial credit facilities, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe failure to attract or to retain management or key operating personnel, including directors, could adversely affect\noperations.\nOur success to date has depended, and will continue to depend, largely on the skills and efforts of our management team,\nincluding our ability to interpret market data correctly and to interpret and respond to economic, market and other conditions in\norder to locate and adopt appropriate opportunities. We are also dependent on the services of key executives, including our\ndirectors and a small number of highly skilled and experienced executives and personnel. Due to our relatively small size, the loss\nof a key individual on our management team or our inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees and suitably\nqualified staff could have a material adverse impact on our business and future operations. No assurance can be given that\nindividuals with the required skills will continue employment with us or that replacement personnel with comparable skills can be\nfound.\nPage 15\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nWe have significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements. If we are unable to obtain necessary capital on favorable\nterms or at all, we may not be able to execute on our business plans and our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, cash flows and prospects may be adversely affected.\nOur development and the business (including acquisitions) may require additional financing, which may involve high transaction\ncosts, dilution to shareholders, high interest rates or unfavorable terms and conditions. Failure to obtain sufficient financing may\nresult in the delay or indefinite postponement of our business plans and our business, financial condition, results of operations and\nprospects may be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that additional capital or other types of financing will be available\nif needed or that, if available, the terms of such financing will be favorable to us.\nWe are subject to the risks of litigation and governmental proceedings, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are, and in the future may be, subject to legal and governmental proceedings and claims. The parties in such legal actions may\nseek amounts from us that may not be covered in whole or in part by insurance. Defending ourselves against such legal actions\ncould result in significant costs and could require a substantial amount of time and effort by our management team. We cannot\npredict the outcome of litigation or governmental proceedings to which we are a party or whether we will be subject to future legal\nactions. As a result, the potential costs associated with legal actions against us could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects.\nInsurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability.\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and hazards generally. Such occurrences could result in damage to property,\ninventory, facilities, personal injury or death, damage to our properties, or the properties of others, monetary losses and possible\nlegal liability. We may be subject to product liability and medical malpractice claims, which may adversely affect our operations. Our\nindustry is highly regulated, and may be subject to regulatory scrutiny for violations of regulations and laws. We could be adversely\naffected by the time and cost involved with regulatory investigations even if we have operated in compliance with all laws.\nInvestigations could also adversely affect the timely payment of receivables.\nAlthough we maintain insurance to protect against certain risks in such amounts as we consider to be reasonable, our insurance\nwill not cover all the potential risks associated with our operations. We may also be unable to maintain insurance to cover these\nrisks at economically feasible premiums. Insurance coverage may not continue to be available or may not be adequate to cover\nany resulting liability. We might also become subject to liability which may not be insured against or which we may elect not to\ninsure against because of premium costs or other reasons. Losses from these events may cause us to incur significant costs that\ncould have a material adverse effect upon our financial performance and results of operations.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that\ntechnology, including any cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we receive certain personal information, in both physical and electronic formats, about our\npatients, our employees, and our vendors. We maintain substantial security measures and data backup systems to protect, store,\nand prevent unauthorized access to such information. Nevertheless, it is possible that computer hackers and others (through\ncyberattacks, which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, or by other means) might defeat our security\nmeasures in the future and obtain the personal information of customers, their loved ones, our employees, and our vendors that we\nhold. If we fail to protect this information, we could experience significant costs and expenses as well as damage to our reputation.\nAdditionally, legislation relating to cybersecurity threats could impose additional requirements on our operations.\nOur ability to manage and maintain our internal reports effectively and integration of new business acquisitions depends\nsignificantly on our enterprise resource planning system and other information systems. Some of our information technology\nsystems may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with ongoing systems\nimplementation work. The failure of our systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security or\nother unauthorized access of these systems, may also result in reduced efficiency of our operations and could require significant\ncapital investments to remediate any such failure, problem or breach and to comply with applicable regulations, all of which could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruptions in the credit and financial markets may have an adverse impact on our ability to obtain capital and financing\nfor our operations.\nMarket events and conditions, including disruptions in the international credit markets and other financial systems and the\ndeterioration of global economic conditions, could impede our access to capital or increase the cost of capital. These disruptions\ncould, among other things, make it more difficult for us to obtain, or increase our cost of obtaining, capital and financing for our\noperations. Access to additional capital may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nPage 16\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nOur strategic growth plan, which involves the acquisition of other businesses, may not succeed.\nOur strategic growth plan calls for significant growth in our business over the next several years through an increase in our density\nin select markets where we are established as well as the expansion of our geographic footprint into new markets. This growth\nwould place (and has placed) significant demands on our management team, systems, internal controls and financial and\nprofessional resources. As a result, we could be required to incur (and have incurred) expenses for hiring additional qualified\npersonnel, retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems and expanding our information\ntechnology infrastructure. If we are unable to effectively manage growth, our financial results could be adversely impacted.Our\nstrategic growth plan contemplates continued growth from future acquisitions of home medical equipment and service providers.\nWe may face increased competition for attractive acquisition candidates, which may limit the number of acquisition opportunities\navailable to us or lead to the payment of higher prices for acquisitions. Without successful acquisitions, our future growth rate could\ndecline. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any future acquisitions, if consummated, will result in further growth.\nThe integration of acquisitions requires significant attention from management, may impose substantial demands on our operations\nor other projects and may impose challenges on us including, but not limited to, consistencies in business standards, procedures,\npolicies and business cultures. We cannot assure you that any future acquisitions, if consummated, will result in further growth.\nSpecific integration risks relating to our acquisition of other businesses may include: difficulties related to combining previously\nseparate businesses into a single unit, including patient transitions, product and service offerings, distribution and operational\ncapabilities and business cultures; availability of financing to the extent needed to fund acquisitions; customer loss and other\ngeneral business disruption; managing the integration process while completing other independent acquisitions or dispositions;\ndiversion of management’s attention from day-to-day operations; assumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including\nunforeseen or contingent liabilities or liabilities in excess of the amounts estimated; failure to realize anticipated benefits and\nsynergies, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; potentially substantial costs and expenses associated with\nacquisitions and dispositions; and failure to retain and motivate key employees difficulties in establishing and applying our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures to an acquired business.\nWe may be negatively impacted by inflation.\nCurrent and anticipated inflationary effects may have an adverse effect on our business and be influenced by various factors,\nincluding general cost increases, disruptions in our supply chain, and governmental stimulus or fiscal policies. The services and\nproducts we provide to patients are subject to fluctuations based on the costs of materials, labor, and transportation, including fuel\nexpenses. The rising costs of our services and products can be attributed, in part, to increased shipping expenses and general\ninflationary trends. Moreover, there is uncertainty regarding our ability to pass on these increased costs to customers to mitigate\ninflationary pressures. Sustained increases in inflation could impact the overall demand for our products and services, as well as\nour labor, equipment, and product costs, potentially affecting our profit margins. This, in turn, could have adverse consequences for\nour business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Despite recent inflationary trends, we cannot accurately\npredict whether these patterns will persist. Future volatility in general price inflation and its impact on material availability, shipping,\nwarehousing, and operational overhead could further impact financial results. We attempt to address these pressures through our\ninflation-linked reimbursement contracts, negotiation, leveraging our purchasing power and embracing technology, such as our\nproprietary clinical management platform.\nRisks Relating to Government Regulation\nHealthcare reform legislation may affect our business.\nHealthcare reform laws significantly affect the U.S. healthcare services industry. In recent years, many legislative proposals have\nbeen introduced or proposed in Congress and in some state legislatures that would affect major changes in the healthcare system,\neither nationally or at the state level. At the federal level, Congress has continued to propose or consider healthcare budgets that\nsubstantially reduce payments under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. See “Business–Government Regulation” in Item 1 for\nmore information. The ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation and the impact of potential legislation\non us is uncertain and difficult, if not impossible, to predict. That impact may be material to our business, financial condition or\nresults of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, and if we fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could\nsuffer severe criminal or civil sanctions or be required to make significant changes to our operations that could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe federal government and all states in which we currently operate regulate various aspects of our business. Our operations also\nare subject to state laws governing, among other things, distribution of medical equipment and certain types of home health\nactivities, and we are required to obtain and maintain licenses in each state to act as a DME supplier. Additionally, accreditation is\nrequired by many payors. If we fail to obtain or maintain any required accreditation, it could have an adverse impact on our\nbusiness.\nPage 17\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nAs a healthcare provider participating in governmental healthcare programs, we are subject to laws directed at preventing fraud,\nwaste, and abuse, which subject our marketing, billing, documentation and other practices to government scrutiny. These include\nspecific requirements imposed by the DME MAC Supplier Manuals. To ensure compliance with Medicare and Medicaid\nrequirements and other federal and state regulations, government agencies or their contractors often conduct routine audits and\nrequest customer records and other documents to support our claims submitted for payment of services rendered. Government\nagencies or their contractors also periodically open investigations and obtain information from healthcare providers. Violations of\nfederal and state regulations can result in severe criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, and sanctions, including\ndebarment, suspension or exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other government reimbursement programs, any of which would\nhave a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe expect the federal and state governments to continue their efforts to contain growth in Medicaid expenditures, which\ncould adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nMedicaid spending has increased rapidly in recent years, becoming a significant component of state budgets. This, combined with\nslower state revenue growth, has led both the federal government and many states to institute measures aimed at controlling the\ngrowth of Medicaid spending, and in some instances reducing aggregate Medicaid spending. We expect these state and federal\nefforts to continue for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, not all of the states in which we operate have elected to expand\nMedicaid coverage as part of federal healthcare reform legislation. There can be no assurance that any state Medicaid program, on\nthe current terms or otherwise, will continue for any particular period of time beyond the foreseeable future. If Medicaid\nreimbursement rates are reduced or fail to increase as quickly as our costs, or if there are changes in the rules governing the\nMedicaid program that are disadvantageous to our businesses, our business and results of operations could be materially and\nadversely affected.\nRevenue we receive from third-party payors as well as Medicare and Medicaid is subject to potential retroactive\nreduction.\nPayments we receive from governmental healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and private third-party payors\ncan be retroactively adjusted after examination during the claims settlement process or as a result of post-payment audits and\nsubsequent recoupment. Governmental healthcare programs and third-party payors may disallow, in whole or in part, our requests\nfor reimbursement, or recoup amounts previously reimbursed, based on determinations by the payors or their third-party audit\ncontractors that certain costs are not reimbursable because either adequate or additional documentation was not provided or\nbecause certain services were not covered or were deemed not to be medically necessary. Significant adjustments, recoupments\nor repayments of our Medicare or Medicaid revenue, and the costs associated with complying with investigative audits by\nregulatory and governmental authorities and private third-party payors, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition,\nresults of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, from time to time we become aware, based on information provided by third parties and/or the results of internal\naudits, of payments from such payor sources that were either wholly or partially in excess of the amount that we should have been\npaid for the service provided. Overpayments may result from a variety of factors, including insufficient documentation supporting\nthe services rendered or medical necessity or other failures to document satisfaction of the applicable conditions of payment. We\nare required by law in most instances to refund the full amount of the overpayment after becoming aware of it, and failure to do so\nwithin requisite time limits imposed by law could lead to significant fines and penalties being imposed on us.\nFurthermore, our initial billing of and payments for services that are unsupported by the requisite documentation and satisfaction of\nany other conditions of payment, regardless of our awareness of the failure at the time of the billing or payment, could expose us to\nsignificant fines and penalties. We could also be subject to exclusion from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid programs in\nsome circumstances as well, in addition to any monetary or other fines, penalties or sanctions that we may incur under applicable\nfederal and/or state law. Our repayment of any such amounts, as well as any fines, penalties or other sanctions that we may incur,\ncould be significant and could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time we are also involved in external governmental investigations, audits and reviews. Reviews, audits and\ninvestigations of this sort can lead to government actions, which can result in recoupment of reimbursement, civil or criminal fines\nor penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business, loss of licensure or exclusion\nfrom participation in government healthcare programs. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules could have a\nmaterial and adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, responding to\ngovernmental investigations, audits and reviews can also require us to incur significant legal and document production expenses,\nregardless of whether the particular investigation, audit or review leads to identification of underlying noncompliance or\nwrongdoing.\nPage 18\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nAs a result of increased post-payment reviews of claims we submit to Medicare and Medicaid for our services, we may\nincur additional costs and may be required to repay amounts already paid to us.\nWe are subject to regular post-payment inquiries, investigations and audits of claims we submit to Medicare and Medicaid for\npayment for our services. These post-payment reviews have increased as a result of government cost-containment initiatives.\nThese additional post-payment reviews may require us to incur costs to respond to requests for records and to pursue the reversal\nof payment denials, and ultimately may require us to refund amounts paid to us by Medicare or Medicaid that are determined to\nhave been overpaid.\nFor a further description of this and other laws and regulations involving governmental reimbursements, see “Business—\nGovernment Regulation” in Item 1.\nAn economic downturn, state budget pressures, sustained unemployment and continued deficit spending by the federal\ngovernment may result in a reduction in reimbursement and covered services.\nAn economic downturn could have a detrimental effect on our revenues. Historically, state budget pressures have translated into\nreductions in state spending. Given that Medicaid outlays are a significant component of state budgets, we can expect continuing\ncost containment pressures on Medicaid outlays for our services in the states in which we operate. In addition, an economic\ndownturn, coupled with sustained unemployment, may also impact the number of enrollees in managed care programs as well as\nthe profitability of managed care companies, which could result in reduced reimbursement rates.\nThe existing federal deficit, as well as deficit spending by federal and state governments as the result of adverse economic\ndevelopments or other reasons, can lead to continuing pressure to reduce governmental expenditures for other purposes, including\ngovernment-funded programs in which we participate, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Such actions in turn may adversely affect\nour operations and revenue.\nDelays in reimbursement due to state budget deficits may increase in the future, adversely affecting our liquidity.\nThere is a delay between the time that we provide services and the time that we receive reimbursement or payment for these\nservices. Many of the states in which we operate are operating with budget deficits for their current fiscal year. These and other\nstates may in the future delay reimbursement, which would adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, from time to time, procedural\nissues require us to resubmit claims before payment is remitted, which contributes to our aged receivables. Additionally,\nunanticipated delays in receiving reimbursement from state programs due to changes in their policies or billing or audit procedures\nmay adversely impact our liquidity and working capital. We fund operations primarily through the collection of accounts receivable.\nDelays in reimbursement due to claims submission reimbursement processes may cause liquidity problems.\nThere are delays in reimbursement from the time we provide services to the time we receive reimbursement or payment for these\nservices. Delays may result from changes by third-party payors to data submission requirements or requests by fiscal\nintermediaries for additional data or documentation, among other issues. If we have information system problems or issues that\narise with Medicare or Medicaid or private health insurers, we may encounter delays in our payment cycle. Such timing delays may\ncause working capital shortages. Working capital management, including prompt and diligent billing and collection, is an important\nfactor in our results of operations and liquidity. System problems, Medicare or Medicaid issues or industry trends may extend our\ncollection period, adversely impact our working capital. Our working capital management procedures may not successfully negate\nthis risk. There are often timing delays when attempting to collect funds from Medicaid programs. Delays in receiving\nreimbursement or payments from these programs may adversely impact our working capital.\nWe depend in part upon reimbursement by third-party payors.\nA substantial portion of our revenues are derived from private and governmental third-party payors. In 2023, approximately 54% of\nour revenues were derived collectively from managed care plans, commercial health insurers, workers’ compensation payors, and\nother private pay revenue sources while approximately 46% of our revenues were derived from Medicare and Medicaid. Initiatives\nundertaken by industry and government to contain healthcare costs affect our profitability. These payors attempt to control\nhealthcare costs by contracting with healthcare providers to obtain services on a discounted basis. We believe that this trend will\ncontinue and may limit reimbursement for healthcare services. Additionally, from time to time our contracts with payors are\nterminated, amended or renegotiated, sometime unilaterally through policies. If insurers or managed care companies from whom\nwe receive substantial payments were to terminate, amend or renegotiate contracts or reduce the amounts they pay for services,\nour profit margins may decline, or we may lose patients if we choose not to renew our contracts with these insurers at lower rates.\nPage 19\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nWe face inspections, reviews, audits and investigations under federal and state government programs and contracts.\nThese audits could have adverse findings that may negatively affect our business.\nAs a result of our participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, we are subject to various governmental inspections,\nreviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with these programs and applicable laws and regulations. Private health\ninsurers may also reserve the right to conduct audits. An adverse inspection, review, audit or investigation could result in:\n• refunding amounts we have been paid pursuant to the Medicare or Medicaid programs or from private health insurers;\n• state or federal agencies imposing fines, penalties and other sanctions on us;\n• temporary suspension of payment for new patients;\n• decertification or exclusion from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid programs or one or more managed care payor\nnetworks;\n• damage to our reputation; and\n• loss of certain rights under, or termination of, our contracts with private health insurers.\nIf adverse inspections, reviews, audits or investigations occur and any of the results noted above occur, it could have a material\nadverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations relating to the privacy and security of protected health\ninformation and failure to comply with such laws may increase our operational costs.\nHIPAA privacy and security regulations establish a complex regulatory framework governing the use and disclosure of protected\nhealth information (\"PHI\"), including, for example, the circumstances under which uses and disclosures of PHI are permitted or\nrequired without a specific authorization by the patient; a patient’s right to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain\ndisclosures of PHI; the content of notices of privacy practices describing how PHI is used and disclosed and individuals’ rights with\nrespect to their PHI; and implementation of administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect privacy and security of PHI.\nThe federal privacy regulations restrict our ability to use or disclose certain individually identifiable patient health information,\nwithout patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined by HIPAA), except\nfor disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. The HIPAA\nprivacy and security regulations do not supersede state laws that may be more stringent; therefore, we are required to comply with\nboth federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws and regulations.\nThe HIPAA privacy and security regulations also require healthcare providers like us to notify affected individuals, the HHS\nSecretary, and in some cases, the media, when PHI has been “breached”, as defined by HIPAA. Many states have similar breach\nnotification laws. We have established policies and procedures in an effort to ensure compliance with the HIPAA privacy and\nsecurity regulations and similar state laws. However, if there is a breach, we may be required to incur costs to mitigate and\nremediate the impact of the breach on affected individuals, and therefore could incur substantial operational and financial costs\nrelated to such mitigation and remediation. Additionally, HIPAA, and its implementing regulations provide for significant civil fines,\ncriminal penalties, and other sanctions for failure to comply with the privacy, security, and breach notification rules, including for\nwrongful or impermissible use or disclosure of PHI. Although HIPAA regulations do not expressly provide for a private right of action\nfor damages, we could incur damages under state laws to private parties for the wrongful or impermissible use or disclosure of\nconfidential health information or other private personal information. Additionally, HIPAA allows state Attorneys General to bring an\naction against a covered entity, such as us, for a violation of HIPAA. We insure some of our risk with respect to HIPAA security\nbreaches, but operational costs and penalties associated with HIPAA breaches easily could exceed our insured limits.\nHIPAA regulations impose additional requirements, restrictions and penalties on covered entities and their business associates to,\namong other things, deter breaches of security. Our electronic health records system is periodically modified to meet applicable\nsecurity standards. Despite the implementation of various security measures by us, our infrastructure may be vulnerable to\ncomputer viruses, break-ins and other disruptive problems inadvertently introduced by authorized users such as employees and\nclients, or purposefully targeted by hackers and other cybercriminals which could lead to interruption, delays or cessation in service\nto our clients. Further, such incidents, whether electronic or physical, could jeopardize the security of confidential information,\nincluding PHI and other sensitive information stored in our computer systems related to clients, patients, and other parties\nconnected through us, which may deter potential clients and give rise to uncertain liability to parties whose security or privacy has\nbeen infringed. A significant security breach could result in fines, loss of clients, damage to our reputation, direct damages, costs of\nrepair and detection, costs to remedy the breach, government penalties, and other expenses. We insure some of our risk with\nrespect to security breaches but the occurrence of any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations and our financial condition.\nPage 20\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nOur products may be subject to future rounds of Medicare's Competitive Bidding Program, which may negatively affect\nour business and financial condition.\nThe Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 required the HHS to establish and implement\nprograms under which competitive acquisition areas are established throughout the United States for purposes of awarding\ncontracts for the furnishing of competitively priced items of DME.\nCMS, the agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, conducts a competition for each competitive acquisition\narea under which providers submit bids to supply certain covered items of DME. Under the competitive bidding program, DME\nsuppliers compete to become Medicare contract suppliers by submitting bids to furnish certain items in competitive bidding areas.\nAs part of the competitive bidding process, SPAs replace the current Medicare DME fee schedule payment amounts for selected\nitems in certain areas of the country. The SPAs are determined by using bids submitted by DME suppliers.\nSuccessful bidders must meet certain program quality standards in order to be awarded a contract and only successful bidders can\nsupply the covered items to Medicare beneficiaries in the acquisition area. There are, however, regulations in place that allow non-\ncontracted providers to continue to provide products and services to their existing customers at the new competitive bidding\npayment amounts. The contracts are expected to be re-bid every three years. CMS is required to award contracts to multiple\nentities submitting bids in each area for an item or service, but has the authority to limit the number of contractors in a competitive\nacquisition area as necessary to meet projected demand.\nIn 2019, CMS announced the inclusion of non-invasive ventilator products on the list of products subject to the competitive bidding\nprogram in Round 2021 which covers the period of January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2023. Rental revenue from ventilator\nproducts represents a significant portion of our revenue (approximately 59.2% of total revenue in 2023). On March 9, 2020, CMS\nannounced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States President’s exercise of the Defense Production Act, public\nconcern regarding access to ventilators, and the non-invasive ventilators product category being new to the competitive bidding\nprogram, non-invasive ventilators were removed as a product category from Round 2021. On October 27, 2020, CMS announced\nthat it had removed 13 of the 15 remaining product categories from Round 2021, including oxygen and PAP devices, because the\npayment amounts did not achieve expected savings. As a result of these announcements, we retain the ability to continue to\nfurnish non-invasive ventilators and oxygen and PAP devices for all of our Medicare accredited areas. The current Round 2021\ncontracts expired on December 31, 2023 and CMS has not announced a new round of competitive bidding. Historically, CMS\nannounces new rounds of competitive bidding and starts the process approximately 18 months prior to the contract start date. We\ncannot predict at this time the full impact the competitive bidding program and the developments in the competitive bidding program\nwill have on our business and financial condition. In addition, we cannot assure you that non-invasive ventilators and oxygen and\nPAP devices will not be included on the list of products subject to the competitive bidding program in the future. If changes are\nmade to the competitive program in the future, it could affect our reimbursement and revenue.\nIf CMS requires prior authorization for our products, our revenue and cash flow could be negatively impacted.\nCMS maintains a Master List of Items Frequently Subject to Unnecessary Utilization. This list identifies items that could potentially\nbe subject to prior authorization as a condition of Medicare Payment. On April 22, 2019, CMS added home ventilators used with a\nnon-invasive interface to the Master List of Items Frequently Subject to Unnecessary Utilization. If CMS imposes prior authorization\nrequirements for non-invasive home ventilation, it could materially impact our business, revenue and cash flow.\nIf we fail to comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback laws, false claims acts, self-\nreferral prohibitions, and anti-inducement laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and\nfinancial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving\nremuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the\npurchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or any other federal healthcare program.\nThe Anti-Kickback Statute, and similar state laws prohibit payments intended to induce physicians or others to refer patients or to\nacquire or arrange for or recommend the acquisition of healthcare products or services. These laws restrict sales, marketing and\nother promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, which may be used with\nhospitals, physicians, and other potential purchasers or prescribers of our products. The statutory exceptions and regulatory safe\nharbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution are drawn narrowly, and any remuneration to or from a prescriber or\npurchaser of healthcare products or services may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Our\npractices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. However, practices that\ndo not fit into a safe harbor are not per se illegal, and are instead analyzed based on the particular facts and circumstances to\ndetermine whether the practice presents a low risk of fraud and abuse. Although we believe our practices are compliant with\napplicable safe harbors, we cannot assure you that a government regulator will not take the position that some of our practices do\nnot meet all of the narrow criteria of an applicable safe harbor and otherwise violate the Anti-Kickback Statute.\nPage 21\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe Federal False Claims Act prohibits, in part, any person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false claim for\npayment to the federal government, or knowingly making or causing to be made a false statement to get a false claim paid. The\nmajority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and Federal False Claims Act, which\napply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in certain states, apply regardless of payor.\nThese false claims acts allow any person to bring suit in the name of the government alleging false and fraudulent claims\npresented to or paid by the government (or for other violations of the statutes) and to share a certain portion of amounts paid by the\nentity to the government in fines or settlement. Such suits, often referred to as qui tam actions, have increased significantly in the\nhealthcare industry in recent years.\nSanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion from participation in the Medicare and\nMedicaid programs, criminal fines and imprisonment. In addition, the ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of\nthe Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity generally does not need to have actual\nknowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have criminal and/or civil exposure. In addition, the ACA\nprovides that the government may assert that a claim, including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-\nKickback Statute, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the Federal False Claims Act. Because of the breadth of\nthese laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors and exceptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be\nsubject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge, regardless of the outcome, could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, business relationships, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Ethics in Patient Referrals Act, commonly known as the \"Stark Law,\" prohibits a physician from making referrals for certain\n\"designated health services\" payable by Medicare to an entity, including a company that furnishes DME, in which the physician or\nan immediate family member of such physician has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician has entered\ninto a compensation arrangement, unless a statutory or regulatory exception applies. The majority of states also have statutes or\nregulations similar to the Stark Law, which apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in\nseveral states, apply regardless of payor. Violation of the Stark Law and similar state laws could result in denial of payment,\ndisgorgement of reimbursements received under a noncompliant arrangement, civil penalties, damages and exclusion from\nMedicare or other governmental and state programs. Although we believe that we have structured our provider arrangements to\ncomply with current Stark Law and state equivalent requirements, these requirements are highly technical and there can be no\nguarantee that regulatory authorities will not determine or assert that our arrangements are in violation of the Stark Law and state\nequivalents and do not otherwise meet applicable exceptions.\nThe Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes civil monetary penalties and potential exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs\non any person who offers or transfers remuneration to any patient who is a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary, when the person\nknows or should know that the remuneration is likely to induce the patient to receive medical services from a particular provider.\nThe Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law applies, among other things, to many kinds of inducements or benefits provided to\npatients, including complimentary items, services or transportation that are of more than nominal value. We have structured our\noperations and provision of services to patients in a manner that we believe complies with the law and its interpretation by\ngovernment authorities. We cannot assure you, however, that government authorities will not take a contrary view and impose civil\nmonetary penalties and exclude us from participation in Medicare and Medicaid for past or present practices related to patient\nincentive, coordination of care and need-based programs.\nThe scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare\nreform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of\nthe laws described above or any other government regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and\ncriminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment, restructuring, or restricting of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines,\ncurtailment or restructuring or our operations could harm our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Any action\nagainst us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses\nand divert our management’s attention from operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with\napplicable federal and state fraud laws may prove costly.\nThe implementation of alternative payment models and the transition of Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries to managed\ncare organizations may limit our market share and could adversely affect our revenues.\nMany government and commercial payors are transitioning providers to alternative payment models that are designed to promote\ncost-efficiency, quality and coordination of care. For example, accountable care organizations (“ACOs”) incentivize hospitals,\nphysician groups, and other providers to organize and coordinate patient care while reducing unnecessary costs. Several states\nhave implemented, or plan to implement, accountable care models for their Medicaid populations. We cannot predict how the\ncontinued establishment and implementation of these new business models will impact our business. There is the possibility that\nvalue-based payment models, such as ACOs, will drive down the utilization and/or reimbursement rates for our services. We may\nnot be able to gain access into certain ACOs. If we are not included in these programs, or if ACOs establish programs that overlap\nwith our services, we could experience an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nPage 22\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nWe may be similarly impacted by increased enrollment of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in managed care plans, shifting\naway from traditional fee-for-service models. Under the managed Medicare program, also known as Medicare Advantage, the\nfederal government contracts with private health insurers to provide Medicare benefits. Insurers may choose to offer supplemental\nbenefits and impose higher plan costs on beneficiaries. Approximately one half of Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in a\nMedicare Advantage plan in 2023; a figure that continues to grow. Similarly, enrollment in managed Medicaid plans is also growing,\nas states are increasingly relying on managed care organizations to deliver Medicaid program services as a strategy to control\ncosts and manage resources.\nWe may experience increased competition for managed care contracts due to state regulation and limitations. We cannot assure\nyou that we will be successful in our efforts to be included in plan networks, that we will be able to secure favorable contracts with\nall or some of the managed care organizations, that our reimbursement under these programs will remain at current levels, that\nauthorizations for services will remain at current levels or that our profitability will remain at levels consistent with past performance.\nIn addition, operational processes may not be well defined as a state transitions Medicaid beneficiaries to managed care. For\nexample, membership, new referrals and related authorizations for services may be delayed, which may result in delays in service\ndelivery to consumers or in payment for services rendered. Difficulties with operational processes may negatively affect our\nrevenue growth rates, cash flow and profitability for services provided.\nIn addition, other alternative payment models may be adopted by the government and commercial payors to control costs that\nsubject us to financial risk. We cannot predict at this time what alternative payment models may be presented and what effect such\nnew payment models may have on our operations or financial condition in the future.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern our employment practices, including minimum\nwage, living wage, and paid time-off requirements. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or changes to these\nlaws and regulations that increase our employment-related expenses, could adversely impact our operations.\nWe are required to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to employment, including\noccupational safety and health requirements, wage and hour and other compensation requirements, employee benefits, providing\nleave and sick pay, employment insurance, proper classification of workers as employees or independent contractors, immigration\nand equal employment opportunity laws. These laws and regulations can vary significantly among jurisdictions and can be highly\ntechnical. Costs and expenses related to these requirements are a significant operating expense and may increase as a result of,\namong other things, changes in federal, state or local laws or regulations, or the interpretation thereof, requiring employers to\nprovide specified benefits or rights to employees, increases in the minimum wage and local living wage ordinances, increases in\nthe level of existing benefits or the lengthening of periods for which unemployment benefits are available. We may not be able to\noffset any increased costs and expenses. Furthermore, any failure to comply with these laws requirements, including even a\nseemingly minor infraction, can result in significant penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect\non our business.\nIn addition, certain individuals and entities, known as excluded persons, are prohibited from receiving payment for their services\nrendered to Medicaid, Medicare and other federal and state healthcare program beneficiaries. If we inadvertently hire or contract\nwith an excluded person, or if any of our current employees or contractors becomes an excluded person in the future without our\nknowledge, we may be subject to substantial civil penalties, including up to $20,000 for each item or service furnished by the\nexcluded individual to a federal or state healthcare program beneficiary, an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed\nand exclusion from the program.\nEach of our subsidiaries that employ an average of at least 50 full-time employees in a calendar year are required to offer a\nminimum level of health coverage for 95% of our full-time employees in 2023 or be subject to an annual penalty.\nPage 23\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nRisks Related to our Common Shares\nWe are an \"emerging growth company\" and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \"emerging growth\ncompanies\" may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nAs an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain\ndisclosure requirements. We are an emerging growth company until the earliest of:\n• December 31, 2024, the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the first sale of common equity\nsecurities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act;\n• the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more;\n• the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or\n• the date on which we are deemed a “large accelerated filer” as defined under the federal securities laws.\nFor so long as we remain an “emerging growth company,” we will not be required to:\n• have an auditor report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n• include detailed compensation discussion and analysis in our filings under the Exchange Act and instead may provide a\nreduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation; or\n• hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments\nnot previously approved.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period for\ncomplying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period, which\nallows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards until those standards apply to private companies. As a\nresult of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to public companies that comply with new or revised\naccounting standards.\nThe exact implications of the JOBS Act are still subject to interpretations and guidance by the SEC and other regulatory agencies,\nand we cannot assure you that we will be able to take advantage of all of the benefits of the JOBS Act. In addition, investors may\nfind our common stock less attractive to the extent we rely on the exemptions available to emerging growth companies for so long\nas we qualify as such. If some investors find our common shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading\nmarket for our common shares and our share price may decline or become more volatile.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain proper disclosure or internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial\nstatements and supplemental information, or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs we grow, we may be subject to growth-related risks including capacity constraints and pressure on our internal systems and\ncontrols. Our ability to manage growth effectively will require us to continue to implement and improve our operational and financial\nsystems and to expend, train and manage our employee base.\nWe must maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures. We must also maintain effective internal control over financial\nreporting or, at the appropriate time, our independent auditors will be unwilling or unable to provide us with an unqualified report on\nthe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we fail\nto maintain effective controls, investors may lose confidence in our operating results, the price of our common shares could decline\nand we may be subject to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions.\nThe market price for our common shares may experience substantial volatility for reasons unrelated to our financial\nperformance. This volatility may impact the price at which shareholders can sell their common shares.\nOur common shares are listed and posted for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Securities of small-cap and healthcare\ncompanies have experienced substantial volatility in the past, often based on factors unrelated to the financial performance or\nprospects of the companies involved. These factors include macroeconomic developments in North America and globally, and\nmarket perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries. The price of our common shares is also likely to be significantly\naffected by short-term changes in the cost of goods, or in financial condition or results of our operations. Other factors unrelated to\nour performance that may have an effect on the price of our common shares include the following: the extent of analytical coverage\navailable to investors concerning our business may be limited if investment banks with research capabilities do not follow our\nsecurities; lessening in trading volume and general market interest in our securities may affect an investor’s ability to trade\nsignificant numbers of our common shares; the size of our public float may limit the ability of some institutions to invest in our\nsecurities; and a substantial decline in the price of our common shares that persists for a significant period of time could cause our\nsecurities, if listed on an exchange, to be delisted from such exchange, further reducing market liquidity.\nPage 24\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nAs a result of any of these factors, the market price of our common shares at any given point in time may not accurately reflect our\nlong-term value. Securities class-action litigation often has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the\nmarket price of their securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial\ncosts and damages and divert management’s attention and resources.\nThe failure of our common shares to be included in various stock indices could result in the market for our common\nshares to become limited and volatile and the price at which you can sell your shares to decrease.\nYour ability to sell or purchase our common shares depends upon the existence of an active trading market for our common\nshares. Additionally, a fair valuation of the purchase or sales price of our common shares also depends upon an active trading\nmarket, and thus the price you receive for a thinly-traded stock may not reflect its true value. A limited trading market for common\nshares may cause fluctuations in the market value of those common shares to be exaggerated, leading to price volatility in excess\nof that which would occur in a more active trading market.\nAlthough our common shares are quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the volume of trades on any given day has historically\nbeen limited. As a result, shareholders might not have been able to sell or purchase our common shares at the volume, price or\ntime desired. If our common shares are removed from various stock indices, the volume of trading in our shares may decrease\nmaterially as well as the prices at which our shares trade.\nFuture sales of our common shares in the public market could reduce our share price, and any additional capital raised\nby us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute the ownership of existing shareholders.\nWe will require additional funds in order to finance the further development of our business, which funds could be raised by, among\nother things, the issuance and sale of common shares. Sales of substantial amounts of our common shares (including shares\nissued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market\nprices of our common shares. The perception in the public market that major shareholders might sell substantial amounts of our\ncommon shares could also depress the market price of our common shares.\nIn the future, we may attempt to obtain financing or further increase our capital resources by issuing additional shares of our\ncommon shares or by offering debt or other equity securities, including senior or subordinated notes, debt securities convertible\ninto equity or shares of preferred stock. Issuing additional common shares or other equity securities or securities convertible into\nequity may dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common shares or\nboth. Upon liquidation, holders of such debt securities and preferred shares, if issued, and lenders with respect to other borrowings\nwould receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common shares. Debt securities convertible into\nequity could be subject to adjustments in the conversion ratio pursuant to which certain events may increase the number of equity\nsecurities issuable upon conversion. Preferred shares, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or\na preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common shares.\nOur decision to issue securities in any future offering will, in part, depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our\ncontrol, which may adversely affect the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common shares bear\nthe risk that future offerings may reduce the market price of our common shares and dilute their shareholdings. We cannot predict\nthe size of future issuances of our common shares or securities convertible into common shares or the effect, if any, that future\nissuances and sales of shares of our common shares will have on the market price of our common shares.\nWe will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a U.S. public reporting company, and our management is\nrequired to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a U.S. public reporting company, we will incur, particularly after we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” significant\nlegal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the\nSEC and NASDAQ have imposed various requirements on U.S. public companies, including establishment and maintenance of\neffective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. We may have to hire additional accounting, finance,\nand other personnel in connection with our efforts to comply with the requirements of being a U.S. public reporting company, and\nour management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time towards maintaining compliance with these\nrequirements. These requirements increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-\nconsuming and costly.\nPage 25\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nWe no longer qualify as a “smaller reporting company” and, subject to certain exemptions and relief from various\nreporting requirements that are applicable to emerging growth companies, we will be required to comply with larger\ncompany disclosure obligations beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March\n31, 2024, which may increase our costs and demands on management.\nAs of June 30, 2023, we determined that we no longer qualify as a “smaller reporting company” and, subject to certain exemptions\nand relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to emerging growth companies, we will be required to comply\nwith larger company disclosure obligations beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March\n31, 2024. The loss of smaller reporting company status and compliance with such larger company disclosure obligations (subject to\ncertain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to emerging growth companies) may increase\nour legal and financial compliance costs and cause management and other personnel to divert attention from operational and other\nbusiness matters to devote additional time to public company reporting requirements. In addition, if we are not able to comply with\nchanging requirements in a timely manner, the market price of our common shares could decline and we could be subject to\nsanctions or investigations by the stock exchanges on which our common shares are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities,\nwhich would require additional financial and management resources.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common shares, investors may not receive any return on\ntheir investment unless the value of our common shares appreciates.\nWe may retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and have no\ncurrent plans to pay any cash dividends on our common shares. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of\ncash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors (the “Board”) and will depend on then-existing conditions, including\nour financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and other factors\nthat the Board considers relevant. Accordingly, investors may only see a return on their investment if the value of our common\nshares appreciates.\nCanadian laws differ from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our\nsecurities.\nWe are a Canadian corporation and are subject to the Business Corporations Act and certain other applicable securities laws as a\nCanadian issuer, which laws may differ from those governing a company formed under the laws of a United States jurisdiction. The\nprovisions under Business Corporations Act and other relevant laws may affect the rights of shareholders differently than those of a\ncompany governed by the laws of a United States jurisdiction, and may, together with our notice of articles and articles (the\n“Articles”), have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging another party from acquiring control of our company by means of a\ntender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise, or may affect the price an acquiring party would be willing to offer in such an instance.\nPage 26\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe have implemented robust processes and policies dedicated to assessing, identifying, and effectively managing material risks\nassociated with cybersecurity threats. Our cybersecurity program is designed and evaluated based on recognized frameworks such\nas the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Center for Internet Security. These frameworks guide our focus on:\n(i) cultivating organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risks, (ii) implementing safeguards to fortify our systems, (iii)\npromptly detecting cybersecurity incidents, (iv) responding effectively to incidents, and (v) ensuring a swift recovery from any\ncybersecurity event. Where appropriate, these processes and policies are seamlessly integrated into our overarching risk\nmanagement systems.\nWe strive to continually improve our information technology systems, and we prioritize enhancing our defenses through employee\nawareness training, specifically targeting areas such as phishing, malware, and other cyber risks. To reinforce our cybersecurity\nposture, we enlist independent consultants and third-party experts to assist in the establishment and enhancement of our\ncybersecurity program. Regular tabletop exercises, conducted at least annually, test the effectiveness of our processes, with senior\nmanagement actively participating. Valuable insights gained from these exercises are incorporated to refine and bolster our\ncybersecurity measures.\nIdentification of critical third-party relationships vulnerable to cybersecurity threats is an integral part of our risk management\nprogram. Upon identification, we conduct thorough due diligence to fortify these relationships. Our comprehensive insurance\nportfolio includes cybersecurity insurance to provide an additional layer of protection.\nFor further insights into the cybersecurity risks we confront, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors – \"We rely significantly on\ninformation technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity\nincidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively\".\nGovernance\nThe Board oversees our risk management process, including cybersecurity risks, directly and through its committees. The\nCorporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board is responsible for the oversight of cybersecurity-related risks and\nregularly receives quarterly reports from management on our cybersecurity threat risk management and strategy processes. The\nCorporate Governance and Nominating Committee reviews issues concerning our data security posture, results from third-party\nassessments, progress towards pre-determined risk-mitigation-related goals, incident response plans, and cybersecurity threat\nrisks or incidents and developments, as well as the steps management has taken to respond to these risks.\nOur information systems management team, comprising the Chief Information Officer (CIO), Chief Technology Officer (CTO), and\nDirector of Information Security, collectively possesses over 50 years of extensive experience in Information Technology and\ncybersecurity. Prior to their current roles with the Company, our CIO, CTO, and Director of Information Security held various\ninformation technology and cybersecurity positions with other healthcare services and healthcare technology companies. They\nhave collectively obtained various industry-recognized certifications, including the Certified Security Compliance Specialist,\nCertified Cyber Security Architect, and Certified HIPAA Professional designations. The Director of Information Security holds the\nposition of the Information Security Officer and directs cybersecurity operations. To enhance governance and oversight, we have\nestablished a Security Oversight Committee, chaired by the Information Security Officer and joined by key stakeholders such as\nour Chief Information Officer and General Counsel. This committee convenes regularly, typically on a weekly basis, to foster\nalignment and cooperation on security-related issues.\nWe have adopted a comprehensive Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan to direct our responses to cybersecurity events in a\nprompt, effective, and well-coordinated manner. The plan designates a primary manager for each incident and outlines the\ncommunication processes, containment strategies, eradication measures, and recovery protocols. Depending on the severity of a\ncybersecurity incident, senior management and the Board are promptly notified and kept informed of mitigation and remediation\nefforts.\nWe have not identified any risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that\nhave materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our operations, business strategy, regulatory compliance,\nresults of operations, or financial condition.\nPage 27\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nItem 2.

We also own and occupy a 16,000 square foot office building and a 16,000 square foot climate controlled\nwarehouse located in Lafayette, Louisiana. We believe that our facilities are adequate for our needs for the immediate future and\nthat, should it be needed, additional space can be leased on commercially reasonable terms to accommodate any future growth.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to various ongoing or threatened legal actions and other proceedings, including those that\narise in the ordinary course of business, which may include employment matters, breach of contract disputes, as well as\ngovernmental and regulatory matters. Please read Note 9 to the Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for more information. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and to outcomes that are not\npredictable with assurance and that may not be known for extended periods of time.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our\nfinancial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report. The forward-looking statements include\nstatements that reflect management’s beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, anticipations and intentions with respect to our\nfuture development plans, capital resources and requirements, results of operations, and future business performance. Our actual\nresults could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements included in this discussion as a result of\ncertain factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed in the section entitled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements” immediately preceding Part I of this report.\nGeneral Matters\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" and \"our\" refer to\nViemed Healthcare, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nWe were incorporated on December 14, 2016 pursuant to the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). As of June 30, 2020,\nwe determined that we no longer qualify as a \"foreign private issuer,\" as defined in Rule 3b-4 of the Exchange Act, for the purposes\nof the informational requirements of the Exchange Act. As a result, effective January 1, 2021, we became subject to the proxy\nsolicitation rules under Section 14 of the Exchange Act and Regulation FD, and our officers, directors, and principal shareholders\nbecame subject to the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. We will\ncontinue to file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K with the SEC and\nwith the relevant Canadian securities regulatory authorities on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval\n(SEDAR).\nAs of June 30, 2023, we determined that we no longer qualify as a “smaller reporting company,” but we are not required to comply\nwith the larger company disclosure obligations (subject to certain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that\nare applicable to emerging growth companies) until our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31,\n2024. As a result, this Annual Report on Form 10-K is only required to comply with the smaller company disclosure obligations.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the JOBS Act, and as such, we have elected to comply with certain reduced\nU.S. public company reporting requirements.\nOverview\nWe provide an array of home medical equipment, services and supplies, specializing in post-acute respiratory care services in the\nUnited States. Our primary objective is to focus on the organic growth of the business and thereby solidify our position as one of\nthe United States’ largest providers of in-home therapy for patients suffering from respiratory diseases. Our respiratory care\nprograms are designed specifically for payors to have the ability to treat patients in the home for less total cost and with a superior\nquality of care. Our services include respiratory disease management (through the rental of various HME devices), neuromuscular\ncare, in-home sleep testing and sleep apnea treatment, oxygen therapy, and the sale of associated supplies.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue through the rental of non-invasive and invasive ventilators which represented 59.2% and\n67.9% of our traditional revenue, excluding COVID-19 response sales and services for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively. We combine the benefits of home ventilation support with licensed RTs to drive improved patient outcomes and\nreduce costly hospital readmissions.\nWe expect to grow through expansion of existing service areas as well as in new territories through a cost efficient launch that\nreduces location expenses. We currently serve patients in all 50 states. We expect to continue to employ more RTs in order to\nassure our high service model is accomplished in the home. As of December 31, 2023, we employed 372 licensed RTs,\nrepresenting approximately 37% of our company-wide employee count. By focusing overhead costs on personnel that service the\npatient rather than physical location costs, we anticipate that we will efficiently scale our business in regions that are currently not\nbeing effectively serviced.\nThe continued trend of servicing patients in the home rather than in hospitals is aligned with our business objective and we\nanticipate that this trend will continue to offer growth opportunities for us. We expect to continue to be a solution to the rising health\ncosts in the United States by offering more cost effective, home based solutions while increasing the quality of life for patients\nfighting serious respiratory diseases.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we generated revenues of $183.0 million and had net income of $10.2 million, compared\nto revenues of $138.8 million and net income of $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Excluding COVID-19 response\nsales and services, net revenue increased $46.5 million (or 34.0%) from the comparable period in 2022.\nPage 30\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nOur primary sources of capital to date have been from operating cash flows. Our existing commercial credit facilities provide\naccess to additional liquidity through a revolving credit facility of up to $30.0 million and a delayed draw term loan facility of up to\n$30.0 million. An accordion feature allows the Company to increase the size of such facilities by up to an additional $30.0 million,\nsubject to certain conditions, for a total borrowing capacity of up to $90 million.\nTrends Affecting our Business\nHome medical equipment markets are witnessing sustained expansion, with a notable focus on the complex respiratory and\nObstructive Sleep Apnea (\"OSA\") device segments. Analysts in the industry anticipate a consistent and robust growth trajectory,\nprojecting Compound Annual Growth Rates (\"CAGR\") of approximately 6% for respiratory devices and 8% for OSA devices. This\nupward trend underscores the increasing demand for innovative solutions in respiratory care and sleep apnea management,\nhighlighting the industry's responsiveness to evolving healthcare needs. As technological advancements and awareness drive the\nadoption of these specialized devices, we believe the HME markets, particularly in respiratory and OSA, are positioned for\ncontinuous expansion, offering promising opportunities for both providers and consumers alike.\nThe aging population remains a pivotal driver for the industry, as the elderly, constituting a substantial portion of HME patients, are\nexpected to represent a higher percentage of the overall population. Projections from industry analysts indicate a consistent annual\ngrowth in the number of Medicare beneficiaries, contributing to ongoing patient volume growth. A significant contributing factor to\nthe industry's growth is the rising incidence of chronic diseases. Factors such as increasing obesity rates, consequences of past\nsmoking prevalence, under-diagnosis of certain health conditions, and higher diagnosis rates for chronic diseases collectively\nshape the industry. There is a notable shift towards home-based treatment for these conditions.\nThe industry is undergoing a transition to value-based healthcare, with both government and commercial payors increasingly\nadopting models that emphasize the transition of patients from acute care settings to home care. We believe HME providers are\nwell-positioned to benefit from this industry shift. Advancements in technology and medical equipment have led to an increased\nprevalence of in-home treatments. The broader range of treatments administered in patient homes is expected to continue growing.\nProjections from industry analysts indicate that U.S. home healthcare spending will increase, reaching $250 billion by 2031, with a\nCAGR of approximately 7%.\nMarket consolidation is a notable trend favoring larger, financially stable players. The decline in the number of smaller regional\nplayers is attributed to the capital investment and scale required to compete effectively. This has led to a more consolidated and\ncompetitive landscape in the DME market.\nDespite these positive trends, the industry faces challenges such as cost containment efforts of payors. The consolidation of\nmanaged care payors into larger purchasing groups has increased negotiating power, resulting in pricing pressure on HME\nproviders. In addition to ongoing negotiations contract management with third party payors to secure fair reimbursement, HME\nproviders are engaging in value-based contracting, focusing on outcomes and patient satisfaction. These value-based contracts\nleverage data analytics to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and quality of durable medical goods and provide evidence-based\ndata to payors demonstrating the long-term benefits and cost savings associated with the use of certain medical goods.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe Company faces current and potential future inflationary pressures driven by factors such as general cost increases, supply\nchain disruptions, and governmental policies. The manufacturing and distribution costs of Viemed's patient equipment are affected\nby rising material, labor, and transportation expenses, including fuel costs. Persistent inflation may impact overall demand, increase\noperating costs, and affect profit margins, potentially adversely affecting Viemed's business and financial performance.\nIn its 2024 DMEPOS Fee Schedule, CMS announced the fee schedule adjustment based on the annual change to the Consumer\nPricing Index for all urban areas. Items that were subject to the competitive bidding program in former competitive bidding areas\nwill receive a 2.9% reimbursement rate increase. Items that were subject to the competitive bidding program in non-competitive\nbidding areas received a 3.0% reimbursement rate increase. Items not subject to the competitive bidding program received a 2.6%\nreimbursement rate increase.\nFuture volatility in general price inflation and its impact on material availability, shipping, warehousing, and operational overhead\ncould further impact financial results. Viemed attempts to address these pressures through its inflation-linked reimbursement\ncontracts, negotiation, leveraging its purchasing power and embracing technology, such as its proprietary clinical management\nplatform.\nPage 31\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe below table highlights summary financial and operational metrics for the last eight quarters.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except vent patients)\nDecember 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31,\nFor the quarter ended 2023 2023 2023 2023 2022 2022 2022 2022\nFinancial Information:\nRevenue $ 50,739 $ 49,402 $ 43,311 $ 39,556 $ 37,508 $ 35,759 $ 33,310 $ 32,255\nGross Profit 32,111 30,562 26,106 24,004 22,896 21,651 20,390 19,743\nGross Profit % 63 % 62 % 60 % 61 % 61 % 61 % 61 % 61 %\nNet Income 3,477 2,919 2,330 1,517 2,438 1,055 967 1,762\nCash and Cash Equivalents (As of) 12,839 10,078 10,224 23,544 16,914 21,478 21,922 29,248\nTotal Assets (As of) 154,895 149,400 149,117 124,634 117,043 119,419 115,904 119,007\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) 12,845 12,081 9,810 8,328 9,306 6,982 6,458 7,273\nOperational Information:\nVent Patients(2) 10,327 10,244 10,005 9,337 9,306 9,127 8,837 8,434\n(1) Refer to \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section below for definition of Adjusted EBITDA.\n(2) Vent Patients represents the number of active ventilator patients on recurring billing service at the end of each calendar quarter.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe are required to disclose “critical accounting estimates” which are estimates made in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and that have had or are reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the registrant.\nWe follow financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States. The more significant of these policies are summarized in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in\nPart II, Item 8 of this report. Not all significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex\njudgments. However, the policies noted below could be deemed to meet the SEC’s definition of a critical accounting estimate.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are presented at net realizable values that reflect the consideration we expect to receive which is inclusive of\nadjustments for price concessions. Due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate,\ncertain estimates are required in order to record revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values. Management’s\nevaluation takes into consideration such factors as historical realization data, including current and historical cash collections,\naccounts receivable aging trends, other operating trends and relevant business conditions.\nInherent in these estimates is the risk that they may have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. It\nis possible that management’s estimates could change, which could have an impact on operations and cash flows. Specifically, the\ncomplexity of many third-party billing arrangements, patient qualification for medical necessity of equipment and the uncertainty of\nreimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded. If the\npayment amount received differs from the estimated net realizable amount, an adjustment is made to the net realizable amount in\nthe period that these payment differences are determined.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business acquisitions. The results of operations of the businesses\nacquired by the Company are included as of the respective acquisition date. The acquisition-date fair value of the consideration\ntransferred, including the fair value of any contingent consideration, is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. To the extent the acquisition-date fair value of the\nconsideration transferred exceeds the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed,\nsuch excess is allocated to goodwill. Patient relationships, medical records and patient lists are not reported as separate intangible\nassets due to the regulatory requirements and lack of contractual agreements, but are part of goodwill. Customer related\nrelationships are not reported as separate intangible assets, but are also part of goodwill as authorizing physicians are under no\nobligation to refer the Company’s services to their patients, who are free to change physicians and service providers at any time.\nThe Company may adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, as it obtains more information regarding asset\nvaluations and liabilities assumed that existed but were not available at the acquisition date, which is generally up to one year after\nthe acquisition closing date. Acquisition related costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed\nas incurred.\nPage 32\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended December 31,\n% of Total % of Total $ %\n2023 Revenue 2022 Revenue Change Change\nRevenue $ 183,008 100.0 % $ 138,832 100.0 % $ 44,176 31.8 %\nCost of revenue 70,225 38.4 % 54,152 39.0 % 16,073 29.7 %\nGross profit 112,783 61.6 % 84,680 61.0 % 28,103 33.2 %\nSelling, general and administrative 87,884 48.0 % 68,161 49.1 % 19,723 28.9 %\nResearch and development 2,782 1.5 % 2,696 1.9 % 86 3.2 %\nStock-based compensation 5,849 3.2 % 5,202 3.7 % 647 12.4 %\nDepreciation and amortization 1,391 0.8 % 1,012 0.7 % 379 37.5 %\nLoss on disposal of property and equipment 645 0.4 % 346 0.2 % 299 86.4 %\nOther income, net (98) (0.1) % (989) (0.7) % 891 (90.1) %\nIncome from operations 14,330 7.8 % 8,252 5.9 % 6,078 73.7 %\nNon-operating income and expenses\nIncome from equity method investments 485 0.3 % 935 0.7 % (450) (48.1) %\nInterest expense, net (424) (0.2) % (197) (0.1) % (227) 115.2 %\nNet income before taxes 14,391 7.9 % 8,990 6.5 % 5,401 60.1 %\nProvision for income taxes 4,148 2.3 % 2,768 2.0 % 1,380 49.9 %\nNet income $ 10,243 5.6 % $ 6,222 4.5 % $ 4,021 64.6 %\nRevenue\nThe following table summarizes our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended December 31,\n% of Total % of Total $ %\n2023 Revenue 2022 Revenue Change Change\nNet revenue from rentals\nVentilator rentals, non-invasive and invasive $ 108,258 59.2 % $ 92,710 66.8 % $ 15,548 16.8 %\nOther home medical equipment rentals 38,315 20.9 % 21,446 15.4 % 16,869 78.7 %\nNet revenue from sales and services\nEquipment and supply sales 25,770 14.1 % 13,927 10.0 % 11,843 85.0 %\nCOVID-19 response sales and services — — % 2,278 1.6 % (2,278) (100.0) %\nService revenues 10,665 5.8 % 8,471 6.1 % 2,194 25.9 %\nTotal net revenue $ 183,008 100.0 % $ 138,832 100.0 % $ 44,176 31.8 %\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, revenue totaled $183.0 million, an increase of $44.2 million (or 31.8%) from the\ncomparable period in 2022. Excluding COVID-19 response sales and services, net revenue increased $46.5 million (or 34.0%)\nfrom the comparable period in 2022. The net revenue increase was comprised of increases in ventilator rental revenue of $15.5\nmillion (or 16.8%), rental revenue from other HME of $16.9 million (or 78.7%), equipment and supply sales of $11.8 million (or\n85.0%), and service revenues of $2.2 million (or 25.9%). The growth in other home medical equipment rentals has been primarily\ndriven by the continued national expansion of PAP, oxygen therapy, and percussion vest activities and the acquisition of Home\nMedical Products, Inc. (\"HMP\"). The increase in equipment sales and supplies is primarily driven by the success of our PAP\nresupply program and other sleep offerings.\nThe increase in service revenue is primarily due to the addition of our healthcare staffing offerings. While ventilator rentals continue\nto make up the majority of our revenue, the organic and acquired growth of PAP and oxygen related sales and services, as well as\nour healthcare staffing offerings, is contributing significantly to the diversity of our overall revenue mix. As we continue to expand\ngeographically into new territories and further expand our presence in our existing territories, we expect continued growth in our\nactive ventilator patient base and our other respiratory offerings.\nPage 33\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, cost of revenue totaled $70.2 million, an increase of $16.1 million (or 29.7%) from the\ncomparable period in 2022. Gross profit percentage increased from approximately 61.0% to approximately 61.6% from the year\nended December 31, 2022 to year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in gross profit percentage is primarily\nattributable to the migration of our revenue mix, which reflects our deliberate efforts towards product and service diversification,\naimed at further enhancing our market position. Gross profit percentage is expected to remain relatively stable in upcoming periods\ndue to subsiding inflationary cost pressures and the positive effects associated with reimbursement rates, offset by some\ndecreases associated with product and service diversification.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 48.0% for the year ended December 31,\n2023 compared to 49.1% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $87.9\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $19.7 million (or 28.9%) from the comparable period in 2022. The\noverall increase in selling, general and administrative expense as compared to the prior period is primarily due to additional\nemployee related expenses to accommodate the overall growth of the Company and transaction costs related to the acquisition of\nHMP. Our full time employee count increased from 743 on December 31, 2022 to 996 on December 31, 2023, an increase of 34%,\nwhich was partially due to the acquisition of HMP on June 1, 2023. Employee compensation expenses increased $10.4 million (or\n27%) as a result of the increase in our employee headcount and increases in incentive and volume based compensation. We\nexpect that selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will continue to improve in 2024 due to\nincreased efficiencies and costs stabilization relative to revenue growth.\nResearch and Development Costs\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, research and development costs totaled $2.8 million, an increase of $0.1 million (or 3.2%)\nfrom the comparable period in 2022. As we continue to invest in research and development related projects to support our\ntechnology initiatives, we expect that the associated costs will remain consistent in 2024 relative to 2023 costs.\nStock-Based Compensation\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, stock-based compensation totaled $5.8 million, an increase of $0.6 million (or 12.4%) from\nthe comparable period in 2022. This increase is attributed to the expense of additional stock-based awards during 2023. We\nanticipate that as we expand our workforce, incorporating stock-based awards as a component of employee compensation, stock-\nbased compensation expenses will correspondingly rise. Historically, revenue growth has outpaced the growth in stock-based\ncompensation, and as a result, the percentage of stock-based compensation relative to revenue is expected to continue declining.\nInterest Expense, Net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net interest expense totaled $0.4 million, an increase of $0.2 million from the comparable\nperiod in 2022. As a result of continued paydowns on debt issued to fund the acquisition of HMP, we expect net interest expense to\ndecrease in 2024 relative to 2023.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the provision for income taxes was a $4.1 million expense, compared to a $2.8 million\nexpense during the 2022 period. Our annual estimated effective tax rate for 2023 is 28.8%.\nNet Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net income was $10.2 million, an increase of $4.0 million (or 64.6%) from the comparable\nperiod in 2022. Net income as a percentage of net revenue increased from 4.5% for the year ended December 31, 2022 to 5.6%\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to improvements in selling, general, and administrative expenses associated\nwith increased efficiencies and stabilizing costs.\nPage 34\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company uses Adjusted EBITDA, which is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") to analyze its financial results and believes that it is useful to investors, as a\nsupplement to GAAP measures. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides helpful information with respect to the\nCompany’s operating performance as viewed by management, including a view of the Company’s business that is not dependent\non the impact of the Company’s capitalization structure and items that are not part of the Company’s day-to-day operations.\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA (i) to compare the Company’s operating performance on a consistent basis, (ii) to calculate\nincentive compensation for the Company’s employees, (iii) for planning purposes, including the preparation of the Company’s\ninternal annual operating budget, and (iv) to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the Company’s operational strategies.\nAccordingly, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information in understanding and evaluating the\nCompany’s operating performance in the same manner as management. In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, certain items (mostly\nnon-cash) are excluded from net income including net interest expense (income), taxes, stock based compensation, depreciation of\nproperty and equipment, and amortization of intangible assets. Beginning with financial results reported for periods in fiscal year\n2023, Adjusted EBITDA also excludes transaction costs and expenses related to acquisition and integration efforts associated with\nrecently announced or completed acquisitions. This modification enables investors to compare period-over-period results on a\nmore consistent basis without the effects of acquisitions. We have recast Adjusted EBITDA for prior periods when reported to\nconform to the modified presentation.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of Net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, on a\nhistorical basis for the periods indicated:\nDecember 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31,\nFor the quarter ended 2023 2023 2023 2023 2022 2022 2022 2022\nNet Income $ 3,477 $ 2,919 $ 2,330 $ 1,517 $ 2,438 $ 1,055 $ 967 $ 1,762\nAdd back:\nDepreciation & amortization 5,918 5,975 5,207 4,762 4,373 4,120 3,740 3,397\nInterest expense (income) 256 237 (20) (49) 32 42 59 64\nStock-based compensation(a) 1,534 1,453 1,471 1,391 1,317 1,309 1,271 1,305\nTransaction costs(b) 61 177 94 206 — — — —\nIncome tax expense 1,599 1,320 728 501 1,146 456 421 745\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 12,845 $ 12,081 $ 9,810 $ 8,328 $ 9,306 $ 6,982 $ 6,458 $ 7,273\n(a) Represents non-cash, equity-based compensation expense associated with option and RSU awards.\n(b) Represents transaction costs and expenses related to acquisition and integration efforts associated with recently announced or\ncompleted acquisitions.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in\naccordance with GAAP. It is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an\nalternative to revenue or net income, as applicable, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an\nalternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of the Company's liquidity, and may not be comparable to other\nsimilarly titled measures of other companies or businesses. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA does not\nreflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of ongoing operations; and other\ncompanies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023 was $12.8 million, compared to $16.9 million at December 31, 2022. The\nprimary non-recurring use of excess cash during the 2023 period was to fund the acquisition of HMP. Based on our current plan of\noperations, we believe this amount, when combined with expected cash flows from operations and amounts available under our\n2022 Senior Credit Facilities will be sufficient to fund our growth strategy and to meet our anticipated operating expenses, capital\nexpenditures, and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months from the date of this filing.

The Company acquired and cancelled 75,235 common shares\nat a cost of $0.6 million to satisfy employee income tax withholding associated with RSUs vestings while proceeds from the\nexercise of options during the year ended December 31, 2023 were $1.3 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 was $15.3 million, consisting of 1,794,163\nrepurchased and canceled common shares at a cost of $9.6 million pursuant to the share repurchase program authorized by the\nBoard on March 7, 2022 and terminated on September 30, 2023 (the \"2022 Share Repurchase Program\"), $1.3 million in principal\npayments on the term note under the prior Commercial Business Loan Agreement with Hancock Whitney Bank (the “Term Note”),\n$4.5 million in principal payments on the building term note under the prior Commercial Business Loan Agreement with Hancock\nWhitney Bank (the \"Building Term Note\"), and $0.1 million for shares repurchased and canceled for tax withholding in connection\nwith RSUs vested in the period, partially offset by $0.3 million proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nPage 36\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nSenior Credit Facilities\nOn November 29, 2022, the Company refinanced its existing borrowings under the prior Commercial Business Loan Agreement\nwith Hancock Whitney Bank and entered into a new credit agreement (the \"2022 Senior Credit Facilities\") with the lenders from\ntime to time party thereto, and Regions Bank, as administrative agent and collateral agent that provides for an up to $30.0 million\nrevolving credit facility (the \"2022 Revolving Credit Facility\") and an up to $30.0 million delayed draw term loan facility (the \"2022\nTerm Loan Facility\"), both maturing in November 2027.\nThe proceeds of the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility may be used to refinance existing indebtedness, for working capital purposes,\ncapital expenditures and other general corporate purposes (including permitted acquisitions), and to pay transaction fees, costs\nand expenses related to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities. The proceeds of the 2022 Term Loan Facility and any additional term\nloans established in accordance with the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities may be used to finance permitted acquisitions and to pay\ntransaction fees, costs and expenses related to such acquisitions. Outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Term Loan Facility and\n2022 Revolving Credit Facility were $4.9 million and $2.0 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023.\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are Term SOFR (as defined in the 2022 Senior Credit\nFacilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 2.625% to 3.375%, or, at the option of the Company, a Base Rate (as\ndefined in the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 1.625% to 2.375%.\nThe 2022 Senior Credit Facilities require the Company to comply with certain affirmative, as well as certain negative covenants\nthat, among other things, will restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur indebtedness, grant liens,\nmake investments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations and pay dividends and other restricted payments. The 2022\nSenior Credit Facilities also include certain financial covenants, which generally include, but are not limited to the following:\n• Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (defined generally as total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than (i) for\nany fiscal quarter ending during the period from the closing date to and including December 31, 2024, 2.75 to 1.0 and (ii)\nfor any fiscal quarter ending on and after March 31, 2025, 2.50 to 1.0, subject to certain adjustments following a material\nacquisition.\n• Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (defined generally as (a) adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditures minus\ncash taxes to (b) the sum of scheduled principal payments plus cash interest expense plus restricted payments) of not\nless than 1.25:1.0.\nThe Company was in compliance with all covenants under the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities in effect at December 31, 2023.\nSources of Funds\nCash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $45.2 million compared to $27.7 million\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $12.8 million.\nUse of Funds\nOur principal uses of cash are funding the purchase of rental assets and other capital purchases, the repayment of debt, funding of\nacquisitions, operations, and other working capital requirements. Our contractual obligations primarily relate to the repayment of\nexisting debt and contractual obligations for operating and finance leases. The following table presents our material contractual\nobligations and commitments to make future payments as of December 31, 2023:\nWithin 12 Months Beyond 12 Months\nDebt Obligations, including interest $ 1,617 $ 7,911\nLease Obligations 1,130 2,666\nTotal $ 2,747 $ 10,577\nExcept for the funding of potential acquisitions and investments, we anticipate that our operating cash flows will satisfy our material\ncash requirements for the 12 months after December 31, 2023. In addition to our operating cash flows, we may need to raise\nadditional funds to support our contractual obligations and investing activities beyond such 12 month period, and such funding may\nnot be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, our operations and\nability to execute our business strategy could be adversely affected. We may seek to raise additional funds through equity, equity-\nPage 37\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nlinked or debt financings. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness would have rights\nthat are senior to holders of our equity securities and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. Any additional equity\nfinancing may be dilutive to our stockholders.\nLeases\nLeases under which we assume substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon initial\nrecognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lesser of its fair value and the present value of the minimum\nlease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to\nthe asset. The associated lease liability is drawn down over the life of the lease by allocating a portion of each lease payment to the\nliability with the remainder being recognized as finance charges. Leases that do not transfer the risks and rewards of ownership to\nthe Company are treated as operating leases and are expensed as incurred.\nRetirement Plan\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) retirement plan for employees to which eligible employees can contribute a percentage of their\npre-tax compensation. Matching employer contributions to the 401(k) plan totaled $1.4 million and $1.1 million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has no material undisclosed off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or\nfuture effect on its results of operations or financial condition.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of\nrecently issued accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of\noperations, financial positions and cash flows.\nItem 7A.

(the Company) as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity and\ncash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the\n“consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\nfinancial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of\nthe two years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial\nreporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we\nexpress no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2019.\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\nMarch 6, 2024\nPage F-2\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except outstanding shares)\nAt At\nNote December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents 2 $ 12,839 $ 16,914\nAccounts receivable, net 2 18,451 15,379\nInventory 2 4,628 3,574\nIncome tax receivable — 26\nPrepaid expenses and other assets 2,449 3,849\nTotal current assets $ 38,367 $ 39,742\nLong-term assets\nProperty and equipment, net 4 73,579 67,743\nFinance lease right-of-use assets 401 —\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 2,872 694\nEquity investments 2 1,680 2,155\nDebt investment 2 2,219 2,000\nDeferred tax asset 10 4,558 3,119\nIdentifiable intangibles, net 567 —\nGoodwill 3 29,765 —\nOther long-term assets 9 887 1,590\nTotal long-term assets $ 116,528 $ 77,301\nTOTAL ASSETS $ 154,895 $ 117,043\nLIABILITIES\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade payables $ 4,180 $ 2,650\nDeferred revenue 6,207 4,624\nIncome taxes payable 2,153 —\nAccrued liabilities 5 17,578 11,092\nFinance lease liabilities, current portion 256 —\nOperating lease liabilities, current portion 6 678 495\nCurrent debt 6 1,072 —\nTotal current liabilities $ 32,124 $ 18,861\nLong-term liabilities\nAccrued liabilities 8 558 889\nFinance lease liabilities, less current portion 132 —\nOperating lease liabilities, less current portion 6 2,184 199\nLong-term debt 6 6,002 —\nTotal long-term liabilities $ 8,876 $ 1,088\nTOTAL LIABILITIES $ 41,000 $ 19,949\nCommitments and Contingencies — —\nSHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCommon stock -

Nature of Business and Operations\nViemed Healthcare, Inc. (the \"Company\"), through its subsidiaries, is a provider of home medical equipment and post-acute\nrespiratory healthcare services in the United States. The Company’s service offerings are focused on effective in-home treatment\nwith clinical practitioners providing therapy and counseling to patients in their homes using cutting edge technology. The Company\nserves patients in all 50 states of the United States. The Company was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (British\nColumbia) on December 14, 2016. The Company's registered and records office is located at Suite 2800, Park Place, 666 Burrard\nStreet, Vancouver, British Columbia V6C 2Z7 and its corporate office is located at 625 E. Kaliste Saloom Road, Lafayette,\nLouisiana 70508.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company determined that it no longer qualifies as a “smaller reporting company,” but the Company is not\nrequired to comply with the larger company disclosure obligations (subject to certain exemptions and relief from various reporting\nrequirements that are applicable to emerging growth companies) until our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period\nended March 31, 2024. As a result, this Annual Report on Form 10-K is only required to comply with the smaller company\ndisclosure obligations.\nThe Company is an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \"JOBS Act\"), and, as\nsuch, has elected to comply with certain reduced U.S. public company reporting requirements.\nThe Company’s common shares are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \"VMD\".\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and pursuant to the rules and\nregulations of the SEC.\nIn the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments that are necessary to present fairly\nthe financial position, results of operations, and cash flows have been made.\nReporting Currency\nAll values are in U.S. dollars ($ or \"USD\").\nBasis of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany\ntransactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date\nof the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nManagement bases these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience, existing and known circumstances, authoritative\naccounting pronouncements and other factors that management believes to be reasonable. Significant areas requiring the use of\nmanagement estimates relate to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, business combinations, income tax provisions, and fair\nvalue of financial instruments. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company’s chief operating decision-makers (\"CODMs\") are its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, who make\nresource allocation decisions and assess performance based on financial information presented on an aggregate basis. There are\nno segment managers who are held accountable by the chief operating decision-makers, or anyone else, for any planning, strategy\nand key decision-making regarding operations. The corporate office is responsible for contract negotiation with vendors and\npayors, corporate compliance with healthcare laws and regulations, and revenue cycle management, among other corporate\nsupporting functions. Accordingly, the Company has a single reportable segment and operating segment structure based on ASC\n280, Segment Reporting.\nPage F-7\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with an original maturity of three months or less that are\nreadily convertible to known amounts of cash that are subject to insignificant risk or change. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the\nCompany's cash was held primarily in checking and money market accounts. Cash and cash equivalents consist of the following at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nCash $ 7,182 $ 5,910\nMoney market accounts 5,657 11,004\nTotal cash and cash equivalents $ 12,839 $ 16,914\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable and net revenues are based on contractually agreed-upon rates for services provided, reduced by estimated\nadjustments, including variable consideration for implicit price concessions for sales revenue. Inherent in these estimates is the\nrisk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available. The complexity of third-party billing\narrangements and laws and regulations governing Medicare and Medicaid may result in adjustments to amounts originally\nrecorded.\nThe Company performs a periodic analysis to review the valuation of accounts receivable and collectability of outstanding\nbalances. These estimates are determined utilizing historical realization data under a portfolio approach which is then assessed by\nmanagement to evaluate whether adjustments should be made based on accounts receivable aging trends, other operating trends,\nand relevant business conditions such as governmental and managed care payor claims processing procedures.\nThe Company records a reserve for estimated probable losses as part of net rental revenue adjustments in order to report rental\nrevenue at an expected collectable amount based on the total portfolio of operating lease receivables for which collectability has\nbeen deemed probable. The accounts receivable are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of the adjustments.\nReceivables are considered past due when not collected by established due dates. Specific patient balances are written off after\ncollection efforts have been followed and the account has been determined to be uncollectible. Revisions in reserve estimates are\nrecorded as an adjustment to net revenue in the period of revision. The estimates of the allowance for uncollectible accounts was\n$11.1 million and $8.5 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIncluded in accounts receivable at December 31, 2023 are amounts due from Medicare and Medicaid representing 28% and 4%,\nrespectively, and 32% combined, of total outstanding net receivables. As of December 31, 2022, 48% of total outstanding\nreceivables were amounts due from Medicare and Medicaid.\nInventory\nInventory represents non-serialized supplies that consist of equipment parts, consumables, and associated product supplies and is\nexpensed at the time of sale or use. The Company values inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Obsolete and\nunserviceable inventories are valued at estimated net realizable value.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at historic cost less accumulated depreciation. Major\nrenewals and improvements that extend the useful life of assets are capitalized to the respective property accounts, while\nmaintenance and repairs, which do not extend the useful life of the respective assets, are expensed as incurred. Management has\nestimated the useful lives of equipment leased to customers. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the\nestimated useful lives of the respective assets. Property and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their\nestimated useful lives.\nPage F-8\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe estimated useful lives of the property and equipment are as follows:\nDescription Estimated Useful Lives\nMedical Equipment 1 - 10 Years\nComputer Equipment 5 Years\nOffice Furniture & Fixtures 5 - 10 Years\nLeasehold Improvements Shorter of Useful Life or Lease\nVehicles 5 Years\nBuildings 15 - 39 Years\nLand Indefinite Life\nDepreciation of medical equipment commences at the date of service, which represents the date that the asset has been delivered\nto a patient and is put in use and continues through the useful life of the asset. Property and equipment with definite useful lives are\ntested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nEquity Investments\nEquity investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are comprised of an investment accounted for under the equity method\nand equity investments without readily determinable fair values accounted for under the measurement alternative described in ASC\n321-10-35-2.\nThe following table details the Company’s equity investments:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nEquity method investments $ 320 $ 816\nOther equity investments 1,360 1,339\nBalance, end of period $ 1,680 $ 2,155\nThe Company's equity method investments include a 49% equity interest in Solvet Services, LLC, an entity which provides health\ncare support services to state and federal governments. Investments accounted for under the equity method are investments in\nunconsolidated entities over whose operating and financial policies the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence but\nnot control. Equity method investments are initially measured at cost in the Consolidated Balance Sheets with any subsequent\nadjustments made to the carrying amount of the investment for the Company’s proportionate share of income or loss. Distributions\nreceived from the investee reduce the Company’s carrying value of the investment. The Company has recognized its share of\nincome or loss on the gain (loss) from equity method investments within non-operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome and Comprehensive Income. Equity method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investments may exceed the fair value. No events or changes have occurred\nas of December 31, 2023 that would impair the carrying value of equity method investments.\nOther equity investments include an equity interest in VeruStat, Inc, a remote patient monitoring entity, and an equity interest in\nDMEscripts, LLC, an e-prescribing platform. Other equity investments are investments without a readily determinable fair value\nwhich do not qualify for the practical expedient in ASC 820. For these investments, the Company has elected the measurement\nalternative which measures the investment at cost, less any impairment. ASU 2019-04 clarifies that if an entity identifies observable\nprice changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer, it must measure its equity\ninvestment at fair value in accordance with ASC 820 as of the date that the observable transaction occurred. The Company was\nnot aware of any impairment or observable price change adjustments that needed to be made as of December 31, 2023 on its\ninvestments in equity securities without a readily determinable fair value.\nDebt Investment\nThe Company's debt investment is a variable rate secured convertible note issued by Healthcare DX, Inc. (d/b/a ModoHealth) on\nDecember 21, 2022, classified as an available-for-sale debt instrument. Accrued interest is due upon the 18 month maturity of the\nnote and is included in the amortized cost basis at each reporting period. At each financial statement date until a conversion event,\nthe debt instrument is required to be remeasured at fair value. Changes in unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated\nother comprehensive income, net of tax effect, until realized.\nPage F-9\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets include trade names and other identifiable intangible assets which are amortized on a straight-line basis over a\nperiod of their expected useful lives, generally five years.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $0.5 million in trade names and $0.1 million of other intangibles\nrelated to the acquisition of HMP (as defined below). Amortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets, which is\nincluded in depreciation and amortization in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income,\nwas $75,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The weighted average remaining useful life of intangible assets was 4.4 years\nas of December 31, 2023.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income reflects the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events\nand circumstances from non-owner sources. The Company's comprehensive income represents net income adjusted for unrealized\ngains and losses on derivative instruments, net of tax. Accumulated other comprehensive loss is presented on the accompanying\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as a component of shareholders' equity.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are principally derived from the rental and sale of HME products and services to patients.\nRental revenues\nRevenue generated from equipment that is rented to patients is recognized over the non-cancellable rental period (typically one\nmonth) and commences on delivery of the equipment to the patients. The lease agreements are evaluated at lease\ncommencement and the start of each monthly renewal period to determine if it is reasonably certain that the monthly renewal or\npurchase options would be exercised. The exercise of monthly renewal or purchase options by a patient has historically not been\nreasonably certain to occur at lease commencement or subsequent monthly renewal.\nRevenues are recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with third-party payors, including\nprivate insurers, prepaid health plans, Medicare, Medicaid and patients. Rental revenue, less estimated adjustments, is recognized\nas earned on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable lease term. Rental of patient equipment is billed on a monthly basis\nbeginning on the date the equipment is delivered. Since deliveries can occur on any day during a month, the amount of billings that\napply to the next month are deferred.\nThe Company's lease agreements generally contain lease components and non-lease components which primarily relate to\nsupplies. The Company has made the accounting policy election to account for a lease component of an agreement and its\nassociated non-lease components as a single lease component based on the Company's assessment of classification of the lease\nbased on the consideration in the contract for the combined component.\nSales and Services revenues\nRevenue related to sales of equipment and supplies is recognized on the date of delivery as this is when control of the promised\ngoods is transferred to patients and is presented net of applicable sales taxes. Revenues are recorded only to the extent it is\nprobable that a significant reversal will not occur in the future as amounts may include implicit price concessions under\nreimbursement arrangements with third-party payors, including private insurers, prepaid health plans, Medicare, Medicaid and\npatients. The sales transaction price is determined based on contractually agreed-upon rates, adjusted for estimates of variable\nconsideration. The expected value method is used in determining the variable consideration as part of determining the sales\ntransaction price using historical reimbursement experience, historical sales returns, and other operating trends. Payment terms\nand conditions vary by contract. The timing of revenue recognition, billing, and cash collection generally results in billed and\nunbilled accounts receivable.\nRevenues associated with external staffing services are accrued on an hourly basis and are recorded based on the determination\nof whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent. In arrangements in which the Company manages customers'\nsupplemental workforce needs utilizing its own network of healthcare professionals, the Company is determined to be a principal\nand includes the contractual gross billings in revenues with a corresponding increase to cost of revenues for worksite employee\npayroll costs associated with these services. Alternatively, when the Company acts as agent in the performance of workforce\nmanagement, revenue is recorded based on contractually agreed upon fees or commissions with no associated cost of revenues.\nPage F-10\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe revenues from each major source are summarized in the following table:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nRevenue from rentals\nVentilator rentals, non-invasive and invasive $ 108,258 $ 92,710\nOther durable medical equipment rentals 38,315 21,446\nRevenue from sales and services\nEquipment and supply sales 25,770 13,927\nCOVID-19 response sales and services — 2,278\nService revenues 10,665 8,471\nTotal revenues $ 183,008 $ 138,832\nRevenues from Medicare and Medicaid as percentages of the Company's traditional revenue streams, excluding COVID-19\nresponse sales and services, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nMedicare revenues 44 % 47 %\nMedicaid revenues 2 % 9 %\nTotal Medicare and Medicaid revenues 46 % 56 %\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for its stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, \"Compensation—Stock Compensation\",\nwhich establishes accounting for share-based awards exchanged for employee services and requires companies to expense the\nestimated fair value of these awards over the requisite employee service period. Stock–based compensation costs for stock\noptions are determined at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Stock-based compensation costs for RSUs\nare determined at the grant date based on the closing stock price. The expense of such stock-based compensation awards is\nrecognized using the graded vesting attribution method over the vesting period and the offsetting credit is recorded as an increase\nin additional paid-in capital. Forfeitures are recorded as incurred. Any excess tax benefit or deficiency is recognized as a\ncomponent of income taxes and within operating cash flows upon vesting of the share-based award.\nFor the Company’s phantom share units settled in cash, the Company computes the fair value of the phantom share units using the\nclosing price of the Company's stock at the end of each period and records a liability based on the percentage of requisite service.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nThe Company utilized an interest rate swap contract to reduce exposure to fluctuations in variable interest rates for future interest\npayments on the 2019 Term Note (as defined below).\nFor determining the fair value of the interest rate swap contract, the Company uses significant other observable market data or\nassumptions (Level 2 inputs) that market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities, including assumptions about\ncounterparty risk. These fair value estimates reflect an income approach based on the terms of the interest rate swap contract and\ninputs corroborated by observable market data including interest rate curves. The Company presents a positive ending period fair\nvalue of the interest rate swap contract in other long-term assets, as a component of long-term assets, and a negative ending\nperiod fair value of the interest rate swap contract in accrued liabilities, as a component of long-term liabilities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets.\nThe Company recognized any differences between the variable interest rate payments and the fixed interest rate settlements from\nits swap counterparty as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swap. If determined to be an effective cash flow\nhedge, the Company will record the changes in the estimated fair value of the swaps to accumulated other comprehensive income\nor loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. To the extent that interest rate swaps are determined to be ineffective, the Company\nwould recognize the changes in the estimated fair value of swaps in interest and other non-operating expenses, net in its\nConsolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company settled its interest rate swap in connection with the refinancing of its\ncredit facilities and recognized the realized gain of $0.2 million in Other Income.\nPage F-11\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in numerous U.S. jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the\nprovision for income taxes. The Company’s income tax provisions reflect management’s interpretation of country and state tax\nlaws. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course\nof business and may remain uncertain for several years after their occurrence. The Company recognizes assets and liabilities for\ntaxation when it is probable that the Company will receive refunds from or pay taxes to the relevant tax authority. Where the final\ndetermination of tax assets and liabilities is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the\ncurrent and deferred income taxes provision in the period in which such a determination is made. Changes in tax law or changes in\nthe way tax law is interpreted may also impact the Company’s effective tax rate as well as the Company's business and operations.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future income tax consequences attributable to temporary\ndifferences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases. Deferred\nincome tax assets or liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in\nwhich those temporary differences are expected to be settled. The calculation of current and deferred income taxes requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions and to exercise a certain amount of judgment concerning the carrying value of\nassets and liabilities. The current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are also impacted by expectations about future\noperating results and the timing of reversal of temporary differences as well as possible audits of tax filings by regulatory agencies.\nChanges or differences in these estimates or assumptions may result in changes to the current and deferred tax assets and\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and a charge to or recovery of income tax expense.\nDeferred tax is recognized on any temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated\nfinancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable earnings. The effect of a change in the\nenacted tax rates is recognized in net earnings and comprehensive income or in equity depending on the item to which the\nadjustment relates. At each reporting period end, deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability based on whether it is more\nlikely than not that sufficient taxable earnings will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business acquisitions. The results of operations of the business\nacquired by the Company are included as of the respective acquisition date. The acquisition-date fair value of the consideration\ntransferred, including the fair value of any contingent consideration, is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. To the extent the acquisition-date fair value of the\nconsideration transferred exceeds the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed,\nsuch excess is allocated to goodwill. Patient relationships, medical records and patient lists are not reported as separate intangible\nassets due to the regulatory requirements and lack of contractual agreements but are part of goodwill. Customer related\nrelationships are not reported as separate intangible assets but are part of goodwill as authorizing physicians are under no\nobligation to refer the Company’s services to their patients, who are free to change physicians and service providers at any time.\nThe Company may adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, as it obtains more information regarding asset\nvaluations and liabilities assumed that existed but were not available at the acquisition date, which is generally up to one year after\nthe acquisition closing date. Acquisition related costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed\nas incurred.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill resulting from business combinations is not amortized, rather, it is assessed for impairment annually and upon the\noccurrence of a triggering event or change in circumstances indicating a possible impairment. Such triggering events potentially\nwarranting an annual or interim goodwill impairment assessment include, among other factors, declines in historical or projected\nrevenue, operating income or cash flows, and sustained decreases in the Company’s stock price or market capitalization. Such\nchanges in circumstance can include, among others, changes in the legal environment, reimbursement environment, operating\nperformance, and/or future prospects.\nThe Company performs its annual impairment assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year. The impairment\nassessment can be performed on either a quantitative or qualitative basis. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to\ndetermine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. If determined necessary, the Company\napplies the quantitative impairment test to identify and measure the amount of impairment, if any. Fair value determinations require\nconsiderable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors, such as estimates of a reporting unit's\nfair value and judgment about impairment triggering events. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and\nassumptions made for purposes of the annual or interim goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future.\nPage F-12\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company performed an assessment of qualitative factors and determined that no\nevents or circumstances existed that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived\nassets were less than the carrying amount. As such, a quantitative analysis was not required to be performed and the Company did\nnot record any goodwill impairment charges.\nThe Company follows ASC Topic 360, which requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the asset group’s carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In performing the review for\nrecoverability, if future undiscounted cash flows (excluding interest charges) from the use and ultimate disposition of the assets are\nless than their carrying values, an impairment loss represented by the difference between its fair value and carrying value, is\nrecognized. When properties are classified as held for sale they are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or the expected\nsales price less costs to sell. There were no impairment charges recognized during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nNet Income per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nBasic net income per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding\nduring the period. Diluted net income per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of\ncommon stock plus the effect of dilutive stock-based awards outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.\nDilutive stock-based awards include outstanding common stock options and time-based RSUs.\nSee Note 11 for earnings per share computations.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nOn January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on\nFinancial Instruments. The standard replaces the current incurred loss impairment model that recognizes losses when a probable\nthreshold is met with a requirement to recognize lifetime expected credit losses immediately when a financial asset is originated or\npurchased. Further, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04 and ASU 2019-05 to provide additional guidance on the credit losses standard.\nWhile the adoption of ASC 326 could result in a higher allowance recorded in the future for credit losses on receivables within the\nscope of the standard due to the prescribed measurement principles, the impact of the adoption on the Company's consolidated\nfinancials statements was not material.\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, Liabilities — Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of\nSupplier Finance Program Obligations, which requires entities that use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase\nof goods and services to disclose the key terms of the programs and information about their obligations that are outstanding at the\nend of the reporting period. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022,\nincluding interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company adopted this standard during the year ended December 31, 2023, which\ndid not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company” as defined by the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth\ncompany can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can selectively\ndelay the adoption of all accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Company\nhas elected to utilize this exemption and, as a result, the consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to the financial\nstatements of issuers that are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are\napplicable to public companies. To date, however, the Company has not delayed the adoption of any accounting standards except\nas noted below. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that the Company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period at\nany time, which election is irrevocable.\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-09,\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which is intended to improve the transparency of income tax\ndisclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the effective tax rate reconciliation and\nincome taxes paid by jurisdiction. The ASU is effective for public business entities' annual periods beginning after December 15,\n2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nPage F-13\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\n3. Business Combinations\nOn June 1, 2023, Viemed, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the acquisition of Home Medical Products,\nInc. (“HMP”), which operates in Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi. The Company acquired 100% of the equity ownership of\nHMP in exchange for approximately $29 million in cash or cash payable, subject to customary post-closing net working capital and\nother adjustments. Approximately $16 million of the purchase consideration was funded by cash on hand, $8 million was funded by\na borrowing on the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, and $5 million was funded by a borrowing on the 2022 Term Loan Facility.\nThe results of HMP’s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. The\nCompany expensed $538,000 of acquisition and integration costs in conjunction with the acquisition for the year ended December\n31, 2023. These costs include system conversion and integrating operations charges, as well as legal and consulting expenses,\nand are included in selling, general, and administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and\nComprehensive Income.\nThe following table summarizes the consideration paid and estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at\nthe acquisition date.\nPurchase Price\nCash paid $ 29,417\nIdentifiable Assets\nCash and cash equivalents 829\nAccounts receivable 2,014\nInventory 582\nPrepaid expenses and other assets 498\nProperty and equipment 4,358\nLease assets 743\nIdentifiable intangibles 641\nOther long-term assets 25\nTOTAL ASSETS 9,690\nIdentifiable Liabilities\nTrade payables 1,985\nDeferred revenue 732\nAccrued liabilities 1,195\nCurrent portion of lease liabilities 536\nCurrent debt 4,558\nLong-term lease liabilities 196\nLong-term debt 836\nTOTAL LIABILITIES 10,038\nNet assets (liabilities) acquired (348)\nResulting goodwill $ 29,765\nPage F-14\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe fair value of accounts receivables acquired is $2.0 million, with the gross contractual amount being $2.9 million. The Company\nexpects $0.9 million to be uncollectible. The amounts of revenue and pre-tax income of HMP included in the Company's\nConsolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income from the acquisition date to December 31, 2023 was $16.2 million\nand $1.3 million, respectively. After the Company's June 30, 2023 financial statements were issued, management identified and\nrecorded immaterial measurement period adjustments to the provisional balances pertaining to the acquired cash and cash\nequivalents, prepaid expenses and other assets, trade payables, and long-term lease liability accounts. As a result of these\nadjustments, there was an increase in the provisional goodwill balance, which resulted in no impact on the current period's income\nor expenses. Also after the Company's June 30, 2023 financial statements were issued, the Company received a final valuation\nreport from a third-party valuation firm. After considering the results of that valuation report, the Company has estimated that the\nfair value of the identified intangible assets acquired as part of the business combination to be $641,000. As a result, the fair value\nof the identifiable intangibles were decreased by $47,000 on December 31, 2023, due to this new information, with a corresponding\nincrease to goodwill. In addition, the change to the provisional amount resulted in a decrease in amortization expense and\naccumulated amortization of $5,500.\nGoodwill resulted from a combination of synergies and cost savings, and further expansion into Tennessee, Alabama, and\nMississippi. All of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes. There are no contingent consideration arrangements included\nin the transaction.\n4. Property and Equipment\nThe Company’s fixed assets consist of its medical equipment held for rental, furniture and equipment, real property and related\nimprovements, and vehicles and other various small equipment.\nThe following table details the Company’s fixed assets:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nMedical equipment $ 110,920 $ 93,893\nFurniture and equipment 3,540 2,792\nLand 2,566 2,566\nBuildings 7,953 7,043\nLeasehold improvements 345 296\nVehicles 1,192 1,052\nLess: Accumulated depreciation (52,937) (39,899)\nProperty and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization $ 73,579 $ 67,743\nDepreciation in the amount of $20.5 million and $14.6 million is included in cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively. Medical equipment purchases with a cost of $1.4 million and $0.7 million were included in accounts\npayable at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n5.

Debt and Lease Liabilities\n2018 Senior Credit Facility\nOn February 20, 2018, the Company entered a Commercial Business Loan Agreement (the \"2018 Senior Credit Facility\") that\nprovided for Term Loans and Lines of Credit with Hancock Whitney Bank. Until November 29, 2022, the Company maintained a\nline of credit in the amount of $30.0 million under the 2018 Senior Credit Facility. On May 30, 2019, the Company entered into a\nterm note (“Building Term Note”) under the 2018 Senior Credit Facility in the principal amount of $4.8 million. The proceeds of the\nBuilding Term Note were used to purchase the Company's corporate headquarters. In connection with the Building Term Note, the\nCompany entered into an interest rate swap transaction (\"Interest Rate Swap Transaction\") with Hancock Whitney Bank effectively\nfixing the interest rate for the Building Term Note at 4.68%. On September 19, 2019, the Company entered into an additional loan\nagreement providing for a term note (the “2019 Term Note\") under the 2018 Senior Credit Facility in the principal amount of $5.0\nmillion and bearing an annual interest rate of 4.60%. The proceeds of the 2019 Term Note were utilized for general corporate\npurposes. The 2019 Term Note matured on September 19, 2022 at which time the entire unpaid balance of principal and interest\nwas repaid in full. In connection with the entry in to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities on November 29, 2022, the Company retired\nthe 2018 Senior Credit Facility, and repaid all outstanding interest and principal in full.\n2022 Senior Credit Facilities\nOn November 29, 2022, the Company refinanced its existing borrowings under the 2018 Senior Credit Facility and entered into a\nnew credit agreement (the \"2022 Senior Credit Facilities\") with the lenders from time to time party thereto, and Regions Bank, as\nadministrative agent (the \"Administrative Agent\") and collateral agent, that provides for an up to $30.0 million revolving credit facility\n(the \"2022 Revolving Credit Facility\") and an up to $30.0 million delayed draw term loan facility (the \"2022 Term Loan Facility\"),\nboth maturing in November 2027.\nThe proceeds of the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility may be used to refinance existing indebtedness, for working capital purposes,\ncapital expenditures and other general corporate purposes (including permitted acquisitions), and to pay transaction fees, costs\nand expenses related to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities. The proceeds of the 2022 Term Loan Facility and any additional term\nloans established in accordance with the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities may be used to finance permitted acquisitions and to pay\ntransaction fees, costs and expenses related to such acquisitions.\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are Term SOFR (as defined in the 2022 Senior Credit\nFacilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 2.625% to 3.375%, or, at the option of the Company, a Base Rate (as\ndefined in the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities) plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 1.625% to 2.375%.\nThe 2022 Senior Credit Facilities require the Company to comply with certain affirmative, as well as certain negative covenants\nthat, among other things, will restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to incur indebtedness, grant liens,\nmake investments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations and pay dividends and other restricted payments. The 2022\nSenior Credit Facilities also include certain financial covenants, which generally include, but are not limited to the following:\n• Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (defined generally as total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA) of not greater than (i) for\nany fiscal quarter ending during the period from the closing date to and including December 31, 2024, 2.75 to 1.0 and (ii)\nfor any fiscal quarter ending on and after March 31, 2025, 2.50 to 1.0, subject to certain adjustments following a material\nacquisition.\n• Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (defined generally as (a) adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditures minus\ncash taxes to (b) the sum of scheduled principal payments plus cash interest expense plus restricted payments) of not\nless than 1.25:1.0.\nThe Company was in compliance with all covenants under the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities in effect at December 31, 2023.\nThe 2022 Senior Credit Facilities include provisions permitting the Company from time to time to, subject to certain terms and\nconditions, increase the aggregate amount of commitments under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility and/or establish one or more\nadditional term loans under the 2022 Term Loan Facility, in each case, with additional commitments from existing lenders or new\ncommitments from financial institutions acceptable to the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion; provided, that, (a) the\naggregate principal amount of any increases in the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, and (b) the aggregate principal amount of all\nadditional term loans under the 2022 Term Loan Facility established after the closing date will not exceed $30.0 million.\nPage F-16\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nFinancing costs related to the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are capitalized and amortized over the term of the loans using the\neffective interest method. Upon the initial draw of debt under the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities during the year ended December 31,\n2023, the Company reclassified the deferred financing fees previously recorded in other long-term assets to long-term debt in the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nThe recorded balances associated with the 2022 Senior Credit Facilities are as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nOutstanding balance $ 6,875 $ —\nFinancing costs and commitment fees (594)\nLess:\nCurrent portion of notes payable (313) —\nNet long-term notes payable $ 5,968 $ —\nMedical Equipment Financing\nAs a result of the acquisition of HMP, the Company assumed equipment financing obligations consisting of installment payments\nfor medical equipment which secure the financing. The financing obligations are payable in monthly installments through 2026 and\ninclude interest at rates ranging from 0% to 7.99%. As of December 31, 2023, $0.8 million of the outstanding medical equipment\nfinancing obligations is presented on the consolidated balance sheets as short term debt based on the scheduled repayment\ndates.\nLeases\nThe Company has recognized finance lease liabilities for vehicles and operating leases for land and buildings that have terms\ngreater than twelve months, as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nLease liabilities $ 3,250 $ 694\nLess:\nCurrent portion of lease liabilities (934) (495)\nNet long-term lease liabilities $ 2,316 $ 199\nOperating Lease Liabilities\nThe Company has recognized operating lease liabilities that relate primarily to the lease of land and buildings. The exercise of\nlease renewal options is at the Company's sole discretion and is included in the lease term for calculations of its right-of-use assets\nand liabilities when it is reasonably certain that the Company plans to renew these leases. These lease liabilities are recorded at\npresent value based on a discount rate of 5.50%, which was based on the Company's incremental borrowing rate at the time of\nassessment. At December 31, 2023, the weighted average lease term was approximately 4.51 years.\nFuture maturities of the Company's operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023 are summarized as follows:\nLease Liability\n2024 $ 874\n2025 736\n2026 615\n2027 617\n2028 560\nThereafter 7\nTotal lease payments $ 3,409\nLess: imputed interest $ 547\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 2,862\nOperating rental expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 amounted to $355,000 and $539,000, respectively.\nPage F-17\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\n7. Fair Value Measurement\nUnder ASC Topic 820, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (i.e., an exit price). ASC Topic 820 establishes a\nhierarchy for inputs to valuation techniques used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and\nminimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. There are three\nlevels to the hierarchy based on the reliability of inputs, as follows:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or\nsimilar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value\nis greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3.\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe Company measures certain assets at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no transfers between fair value measurement\nlevels during any presented period.\nThe following tables summarize the Company's assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022:\nAt December 31, 2023\n(In thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements:\nMoney market mutual funds $ 5,657 $ — $ — $ 5,657\nAvailable for sale debt instrument — — 2,219 2,219\nTotal $ 5,657 $ — $ 2,219 $ 7,876\nAt December 31, 2022\n(In thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements:\nMoney market mutual funds $ 11,005 $ — $ — $ 11,005\nAvailable for sale debt instrument — — 2,000 2,000\nTotal $ 11,005 $ — $ 2,000 $ 13,005\nAvailable for Sale Debt Instrument\nThe fair value of the Company’s available for sale debt instrument approximates its amortized cost basis due to the short maturity\nand indexed interest rate terms. The fair value is classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as the Company evaluates\nadjustments using a combination of observable and unobservable inputs, such as operating results of the counterparty as well\nobservable prices in transactions of debt and equity instruments of the issuing counterparty when available. As of December 31,\n2023, the analysis resulted in no adjustments to the carrying value impacting unrealized gains or losses. All changes to measured\nfair value during the period were the result of accrued interest.\nPage F-18\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nThe Company measures certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets include equity method investments,\nother equity investments, and the fair value allocation related to the Company’s acquisitions.\nEquity method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\nvalue of the investments may exceed the fair value. The Company's other equity investments are holdings in privately-held\ncompanies without a readily determinable market value. The Company remeasures equity securities without readily determinable\nfair value at fair value when an orderly transaction is identified for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer in\naccordance with the measurement alternative under Topic 820. ASU 2019-04 states that the measurement alternative is a\nnonrecurring fair value measurement. Accordingly, other equity investments without readily determinable fair value are classified\nwithin Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because the Company estimates the value using a combination of observable and\nunobservable inputs, including valuation ascribed to the issuing company in subsequent financing rounds, volatility in the results of\noperations of the issuers and rights and obligations of the holdings the Company owns. The Company had no material adjustments\nof equity method investments or other equity investments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during any of the periods\npresented.\nThe fair value allocation related to the Company’s acquisitions are determined using a discounted cash flow approach, or a\nreplacement cost approach, which are based on significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). These valuation methods required\nmanagement to make various assumptions, including, but not limited to, future profitability, cash flows, replacement costs, and\ndiscount rates. The Company’s estimates are based upon historical trends, management’s knowledge and experience and overall\neconomic factors, including projections of future earnings potential. Developing discounted future cash flows in applying the income\napproach requires the Company to evaluate its intermediate to longer-term strategies, including, but not limited to, estimates of\nrevenue growth, operating margins, capital requirements, inflation and working capital management. The development of\nappropriate rates to discount the estimated future cash flows requires the selection of risk premiums, which can materially impact\nthe present value of future cash flows.\nThe Company estimated the fair value of acquired identifiable intangible assets using discounted cash flow techniques that\nincluded an estimate of future cash flows, consistent with overall cash flow projections used to determine the purchase price paid to\nacquire the business, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows. The Company estimated the fair\nvalue of certain acquired identifiable intangible assets based on the cost approach using estimated costs consistent with historical\nexperience. The Company believes the estimates and assumptions used in the valuation methods are reasonable.\nThere were no transfers between fair value measurement levels during any presented period.\n8. Shareholders' Equity\nAuthorized Share Capital\nThe Company’s authorized share capital consists of an unlimited number of common shares, with no stated par value.\nIssued and Outstanding Share Capital\nThe Company has only one class of stock outstanding, common shares. The authorized stock consists of an unlimited number of\ncommon shares with no stated par value, of which 38,506,161 and 38,049,739 shares were issued and outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company acquired and cancelled 75,235 common shares at a cost of $0.6 million to satisfy employee income tax withholding\nassociated with RSUs vesting during the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company’s retained earnings were reduced by the\namount paid for the shares repurchased and cancelled.\nPage F-19\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nStock-Based Compensation\nOn June 11, 2020 (the \"Effective Date\"), the Company’s shareholders approved the Company's 2020 Long Term Incentive Plan\n(the \"Omnibus Plan\") to provide an incentive to attract, retain and reward directors, officers, employees, and consultants who\nprovide services to the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Upon approval of the Omnibus Plan, no future awards are available to\nbe made under the Company's previous RSU and Option Plans (collectively, the \"Former Plan\"), and the common shares that were\nnot settled or awarded under the Former Plan as of the Effective Date are available for awards under the Omnibus Plan. The\nmaximum number of common shares that are available for awards under the Omnibus Plan and under any other security based\ncompensation arrangements adopted by the Company, including the Former Plan, may not exceed 7,758,211 shares (equal to 20%\nof the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company on the Effective Date). The maximum amount of the foregoing\ncommon shares that may be awarded under the Omnibus Plan as “incentive stock options” is 2,600,000 common shares.

The assumptions used to determine the grant date fair value of stock options include exercise price, risk-free interest\nrates, expected volatility, and average life of an option. The risk-free interest rates are based on the rates available at the time of\nthe grant for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the option’s expected life. The average life of an\noption is based on both historical and projected exercise and lapsing data. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from\ntraded options on the Company's common shares and historical volatility of the Company's common shares over the expected life\nof the option. There were no issuances of options during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe Company accounts for RSUs using fair value. The fair value of the RSUs has been charged to the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome and Comprehensive Income and credited to additional paid-in capital over the vesting period, based on the stock price on\nthe date of grant.

Phantom share units\ngranted under the plan are non-assignable and are settled in cash at vesting based on the fair value of the Company's common\nstock on the vesting date. Phantom share units vest annually over a three-year period. The cash-settled phantom share units are\naccounted for as liability awards and are re-measured at fair value each reporting period until they become vested with accrued\nliability and related expense being recognized over the requisite service period.\nThe following table summarizes phantom share unit activity for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nNumber of phantom Value of share\nshare units (000's) equivalents(1)\nBalance December 31, 2021 573 $ 2,991\nIssued 256 1,320\nVested (263) (1,383)\nExpired / Forfeited (53) (401)\nBalance December 31, 2022 513 3,878\nIssued 181 1,444\nVested (245) (2,354)\nExpired / Forfeited (31) (241)\nBalance December 31, 2023 418 3,281\n(1)The value of outstanding share equivalents at the beginning of the period is based on the market price of the Company’s common shares at that\ntime; the value of issued share equivalents is based on the market price of the Company’s common shares at issuance; the value of vested share\nequivalents is based on the cash paid at the time of vesting; and the values of expired/forfeited share equivalents and outstanding share\nequivalents at the end of the period are based on the market price of the Company's common shares at the end of the period. The market price of\nthe Company's common shares was $7.85 and $7.56 on December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nThe change in fair value of the phantom share units has been charged to the Consolidated Statements of Income and\nComprehensive Income and recorded as a liability included in accrued liabilities and long-term accrued liabilities.

Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company accrues estimates for resolution of any legal and other contingencies when losses are probable and reasonably\nestimable in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies (“ASC 450”). No less than quarterly, the Company reviews the status of\neach significant matter underlying a legal proceeding or claim and assess our potential financial exposure. The Company accrues a\nliability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any legal proceeding or claim is considered probable and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether\nthe amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable, and accruals are based only on the information available to the Company at\nthe time the judgment is made, which may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate or unanticipated events and circumstances may\noccur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, the outcome of legal proceedings is\ninherently uncertain, and we may incur substantial defense costs and expenses defending any of these matters.\nPage F-22\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nLegal Proceedings\nAs previously disclosed, the Company (through its subsidiary Sleep Management LLC) submitted a purchase order (the “Purchase\nOrder”) in March 2020 to Vyaire Medical, Inc. d/b/a CareFusion Respiratory Technologies (“Vyaire”) for respiratory equipment. The\nCompany ultimately prepaid $1.4 million towards the delivery of such respiratory equipment. Vyaire was unable or unwilling to\ndeliver the vast majority of the respiratory equipment referenced in the Purchase Order, and also refused to refund the prepayment\namount (less the amounts paid for equipment actually received). On July 29, 2020, the Company (through its subsidiary Sleep\nManagement LLC) filed a lawsuit against Vyaire in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana (the\n“Court”). This lawsuit was dismissed on December 8, 2020 in connection with the commencement of the lawsuit filed by the\nCompany (through its subsidiary Sleep Management) on November 5, 2020, against Vyaire in the 15th Judicial District Court for\nthe Parish of Lafayette, Louisiana (the “State Court”) seeking damages for breach of contract and seeking a declaratory judgment\nthat the Company is not required to pay any further funds to Vyaire. On December 28, 2020, Vyaire filed its Answer, Affirmative\nDefenses, and Reconventional Demand (“Reconventional Demand”) with the State Court alleging breach of contract and seeking\ndamages of $4.7 million purportedly for the improper cancellation of the Purchase Order. The Company filed its Answer to the\nReconventional Demand on February 12, 2021 and the parties completed discovery on July 17, 2023. The State Court issued an\norder on September 5, 2023 granting the Company Partial Summary Judgment finding that Vyaire breached the contract. The\nremaining issue of the damages suffered by the Company as a result of the breach will be determined at a non-jury trial pending\nresolution of Vyaire’s interlocutory appeal of the State Court’s partial summary judgment ruling.\nThe Company continues to believe that it has valid legal and equitable grounds to recover its outstanding prepayment as a result of\nVyaire’s failure to deliver the vast majority of the respiratory equipment referenced in the Purchase Order. The Company has\ndetermined that a loss related to the Reconventional Demand is not probable, and thus has not accrued a liability related to this\nclaim. Although a loss may be reasonably possible, the Company does not have sufficient information to determine the amount or\nrange of reasonably possible loss with respect to the Reconventional Demand given that the dispute is in the early stages of the\nlegal process. At December 31, 2023, outstanding funds in the amount of $0.9 million related to undelivered respiratory equipment\nare included within other long-term assets.\nGovernmental and Regulatory Matters\nFrom time to time the Company is involved in various external governmental investigations, audits and reviews. Reviews, audits\nand investigations of this sort can lead to government actions, which can result in the assessment of recoupment of\nreimbursement, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including restrictions or changes in the way the Company\nconducts business, loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs.\nIn May of 2021, a final report and recommendation (“Report”) was issued by the OIG regarding an audit by OIG of claims relating to\n100 of the Company’s non-invasive ventilation at home (“NIVH”) patients. The OIG asserted that most of the sampled Medicare\nclaims submitted for the monthly rental of non-invasive ventilators did not comply with Medicare requirements. The Company firmly\nbelieved that the Report ignored each patient’s diagnosis and supporting documentation of that diagnosis from treating and\nprescribing physicians and applied clinical guidelines that were contrary to CMS’s accepted standard of care. In late June of 2021,\nthe Company received initial request letters from DME Medicare Administrative Contractors (\"MACs\") referencing the Report and\nrequesting repayment of purported overpayments. The Company responded to each initial request by submitting a rebuttal and by\nfiling a redetermination appeal as prescribed by the initial request letters and by statute. In September 2021, the MACs informed\nthe Company of unfavorable decisions with respect to the redetermination appeals. In November 2021, the Company filed\nReconsideration Appeals with CMS's designated Qualified Independent Contractor (\"QIC\"). Based on its review, the QIC\ndetermined that approximately 77% of the claims it reviewed were medically necessary and properly payable under Medicare rules\nand regulations, overturning OIG’s and the MACs' initial recommendations and determinations. As a result of the QIC's\nreconsideration findings, reduced and recalculated principal overpayment requests totaling $1.1 million were issued by the MACs.\nIn order to limit the assessment of interest during the appeals period, the Company remitted the associated funds to the MACs. In\nDecember 2022, an Administrative Law Judge overturned all of the remaining appealed claims and instructed the MACs to refund\nall funds previously remitted by the Company. Accordingly, the funds remitted to the MACs were recorded in Prepaid expenses and\nother assets at December 31, 2022 and were received during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n10. Income Taxes\nIncome taxes are computed in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, which requires, among other things, a balance\nsheet approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected\nfuture tax consequences of events that have been recognized in its consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this\nmethod, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying\namounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in the years in which the differences are expected to\nreverse.\nPage F-23\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe Company is required to make certain estimates and judgments about the application of tax law, the expected resolution of\nuncertain tax positions and other matters. In the event that uncertain tax positions are resolved for amounts different than the\nCompany’s estimates, or the related statutes of limitations expire without the assessment of additional income taxes, the Company\nwill be required to adjust the amounts of related assets and liabilities in the period in which such events occur. Such adjustment\nmay have a material impact on the Company’s income tax provision and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no amounts recorded for uncertain tax positions and does not expect any\nmaterial changes in uncertain tax benefits during the next 12 months. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to\nincome tax matters in income tax expense. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in various\nstates. The Company is generally not subject to examination by taxing authorities for years prior to 2020.\nThe provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income\nbefore the provision for income taxes.

In assessing the\nrealizability of deferred income tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that all, or some portion, of the\ndeferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the\ngeneration of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management\nconsiders the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment.\nManagement evaluates the need for valuation allowances on the deferred income tax assets according to the provisions of FASB\nASC 740, Income Taxes. In making this determination, management assesses all available evidence, both positive and negative,\navailable at the balance sheet date. This includes, but is not limited to, recent earnings, internally prepared income projections, and\nhistorical financial performance.\nPage F-24\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nState fixed asset and net operating losses $ 1,043 $ 833\nGoodwill 7,977 9,384\nAllowance for doubtful accounts 2,874 2,200\nAccrued compensation and other 1,782 1,071\nAccrued phantom stock 628 672\nStock-based compensation 4,098 3,401\nCapitalized costs 1,137 628\nLease liability 842 180\nOther 170 —\nUNICAP 15 13\nTotal deferred tax assets $ 20,566 $ 18,382\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nRight-of-use asset $ (848) $ (180)\nProperty and equipment (15,141) (15,057)\nTotal deferred liabilities $ (15,989) $ (15,237)\nValuation allowance:\nNet deferred tax asset before valuation allowance $ 4,577 $ 3,145\nLess: valuation allowance (19) (26)\nNet deferred tax asset $ 4,558 $ 3,119\nPage F-25\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\n11. Earnings Per Share\nIncome per common share is calculated using earnings for the year divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding\nduring the year. Using the treasury stock method, diluted income per share amounts are calculated giving effect to the potential\ndilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to issue common shares were exercised or converted to common shares by\nassuming the proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs are used to purchase common shares\nat the prevailing market rate.\nThe following reflects the earnings and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNumerator - basic and diluted:\nNet income attributable to shareholders $ 10,243 $ 6,222\nDenominator:\nBasic weighted average number of common shares 38,354,071 38,655,403\nDiluted weighted average number of shares 40,378,922 39,807,434\nBasic earnings per share $ 0.27 $ 0.16\nDiluted earnings per share $ 0.25 $ 0.16\nDenominator calculation from basic to diluted:\nBasic weighted average number of common shares 38,354,071 38,655,403\nStock options and other dilutive securities 2,024,851 1,152,031\nDiluted weighted average number of shares 40,378,922 39,807,434\nAnti-dilutive shares excluded from the calculation consisted of dilutive employee stock options and RSUs that were de minimis in all\nperiods presented.\nPage F-26\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in\nRules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the\nperiod covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure\nthat information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated\nand communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosure.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that the Company's disclosures controls and procedures will detect or\nuncover all failures of persons within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries to disclose material information otherwise\nrequired to be set forth in the Company's periodic reports. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of\ndisclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and\nprocedures.\nManagement Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for\nthe Company. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, as a\nprocess designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by\nthe Board, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes\npolicies and procedures that:\n• Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the Company;\n• Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\n• Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of\nthe Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of\nany evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes\nin conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment,\nmanagement used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include, and we were not required to include, an attestation report of our independent\nregistered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for as long as we remain an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business\nStartups Act.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31,\n2023 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial\nreporting.\nPage 43\nVIEMED HEALTHCARE, INC.\n(Tabular dollar amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\nItem 9B.

The table above is a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA, on a historical basis for the periods indicated. In\ncalculating Adjusted EBITDA, certain items (mostly non-cash) are excluded from net income including depreciation and amortization of capitalized assets, net interest expense (income),\nstock-basedcompensation,transactioncosts,impairmentofassets,andtaxes.\nSlide 25"

(the “Company”). The Committee will assist the Board\nin discharging the Board’s oversight responsibilities relating to the compensation and retention of key senior\nmanagement employees, and in particular the Chief Executive Officer.\nThe Committee will assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by, among other things:\n(a) setting policies for senior officers’ remuneration;\n(b) reviewing and approving and then recommending to the Board salary, bonus, and other benefits,\ndirect or indirect, and any change-of-control packages of the Chief Executive Officer;\n(c) considering the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer and setting the terms and\nconditions of employment including, approving the salary, bonus, and other benefits, direct or\nindirect, and any change-of-control packages, of the key executives of the Company;\n(d) undertaking an annual review of the Chief Executive Officer goals for the coming year and\nreviewing progress in achieving those goals;\n(e) reviewing compensation of the Board on at least an annual basis;\n(f) overseeing the administration of the Company’s compensation plans, including stock option plans,\noutside directors compensation plans, and such other compensation plans or structures as are\nadopted by the Company from time to time;\n(g) reviewing and approving executive compensation disclosure to be made in the proxy\ncircular/statement prepared in connection with each Annual General Meeting of the Company; and\n(h) undertaking on behalf of the Board such other compensation initiatives as may be necessary or\ndesirable to contribute to the success of the Company and enhance shareholder value.\nComposition and Meetings\nComposition – The Committee will be comprised of at least three directors, each director being\n“independent” (as such term is defined from time to time under the requirements or guidelines for\ncompensation committee service under applicable securities laws and the rules of any stock exchange on\nwhich the Company’s securities are listed for trading). At least two members of the Committee must qualify\nas \"non-employee directors\" for the purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the “Exchange Act”).
