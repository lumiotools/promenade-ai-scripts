The full detailed presentation of Patria's third quarter 2024 results can be accessed on the Shareholders section of Patria’s website at [https://ir.patria.com/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4mulp7XQrB-n0Ftcafdj91l8tjEdFtVXFjioUCMPfw-noXDRg4vLpe1iUispYOjOITV28i2gkhEGXYmMRTxLXv9bOe38z7GFYMW6pnR3BAo=).\n\nAlex Saigh, Patria’s CEO, said: _“The third quarter of 2024 was another exciting quarter for Patria as Fee Earning AUM reached $34 billion representing year-over-year and sequential growth of 58% and 9% percent, respectively. We also delivered $34.9 million of distributable earnings or $0.23 per share and remain confident in reaching our 2024 FRE target of $170 million as well as our 2025 target of $200 million to $225 million. The highlight of the quarter was our robust organic fundraising of over $2 billion, led by our credit business and our GPMS platform, and we’ve raised more than $4.2 billion year to date through the end of 3Q, putting us on track to meet or exceed our $5 billion fundraising target for 2024. Over the last 12 months and as of 3Q, we raised over $5.6 billion, all organically. Our fundraising success, which is being driven by investment platforms that did not exist at the time of our IPO just under four years ago, highlights how the increased diversification of our platform and the investments we are making in distribution and new product development are translating into stronger and more diverse growth for the firm, leaving us very excited about what lies ahead. As we embark on our next chapter of growth, we look forward to sharing more details with you at our next investor day on December 9th in New York.”_\n\n_Financial Highlights (reported in $ USD)_\n\nIFRS results included $1.5 million of net income attributable to Patria in Q3 2024. Patria generated Fee Related Earnings of $40.6 million in Q3 2024, up 13% from $36.0 million in Q3 2023, with an FRE margin of 53%. Distributable Earnings were $34.9 million for Q3 2024, or $0.23 per share.\n\n_Dividends_\n\nPatria has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share to record holders of common stock at the close of business on November 18th, 2024, in accordance with our new capital management strategy. This dividend will be paid on December 9th, 2024.\n\n_Conference Call_\n\nPatria will host its third quarter 2024 earnings conference call via public webcast on November 5th, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. ET.

Fee Related Earnings reached $40 million dollars, representing a 17% increase from 2Q23._ _We delivered close to $34 million dollars of Distributable Earnings, or 22 cents per share.

As previously announced, during the quarter we closed on the acquisition of abrdn’s private equity solutions business, and since the end of the quarter we completed the transition of the Credit Suisse real estate business in Brazil, closed on the acquisition of Nexus Capital which further strengthened our real estate platform in Colombia, and just today concluded our acquisition of the 50% of VBI we did not already own. Of note, we are excited to announce an important update to our capital management strategy and our intention to repurchase up to 1.8 million shares over the next twelve months as we look to maximize returns to shareholders. Overall, I am even more confident that we will reach our 2024 target for Fee Related Earnings of at least $170 million dollars, on the way to generating $200 to $225 million of FRE in 2025.”_\n\n_Financial Highlights (reported in $ USD)_\n\nIFRS results included $0.8 million of net income attributable to Patria in Q2 2024.
