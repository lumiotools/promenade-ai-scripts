In connection with the transaction, an amount equal to approximately EUR 26.6 million (equal to approximately $28.1 million as of November 21, 2024), including interest accrued through the closing date, owed by the Company to the EIB under the amended Finance Contract between the parties was converted into 1,000 preferred shares, no par value per share, of the Company (the \"Preferred Shares\") convertible into a fixed number of ADSs, calculated at the closing date to represent 19.5% of the then fully diluted outstanding capital stock of the Company (364 thousand ADSs). The Preferred Shares do not contain any anti-dilution provisions, do not accrue dividends, and are not subject to mandatory redemption, but are redeemable at the election of the Company at a cumulative redemption value of $34 million. Under the terms of the agreement, EIB may not convert its Preferred Shares into ADSs for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of issuance of the Preferred Shares. In addition, EIB may not convert its Preferred Shares into ADSs if at the time of conversion, the aggregate number of ADSs EIB will receive or would have been entitled to receive within the twelve months prior to such conversion would exceed 4.99% of the ADSs issued and outstanding at the time of such conversion.\n\nFollowing the conversion, the total outstanding amount owed by the Company to the EIB was reduced to EUR 250,000 (equal to approximately $264,000 as of November 21st, 2024). This remaining outstanding amount has a maturity date of December 31, 2031, is not prepayable in advance, and no interest accrues or is due and payable on such amount.\n\nOn August 29, 2024, the Company announced that on August 27, 2024, it had received formal notification from the Listing Qualification Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market that the Company had regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the \"Rule\") that requires listed companies to maintain stockholders' equity of at least $2.5 million. Regaining compliance with the Rule was facilitated by the closing of the Loan Restructuring Agreement with the EIB and the concomitant conversion of the EIB loan as described above.\n\n**CDMO business unit**\n\nSince Jan 2024, the Company has received CDMO work orders valued at approximately $600K, and the Company is in advanced contract discussions with several other potential clients. The Company's sales guidance for 2024 is at $600,000 in expected revenues. The Company has also received $575,000 in grants from the Israeli Innovation Authority in support of its CDMO business unit creation. The Company applied for a grant extension that, if granted, would provide reimbursement for 66% of approved CDMO costs covering up to NIS 1.5 million (approximately $400,000 as of November 21, 2024) of costs. As the Company's CDMO unit is new, and the Company is focused on rapidly growing, acquiring new clients and building its reputation and brand awareness of its CDMO services, the Company expects revenues from the CDMO business to increase materially in the coming years. This is also coupled with growing demand for boutique CDMO services from early-stage biotech companies looking for fast project onset at competitive pricing without compromising on meeting the most stringent scientific and quality standards.\n\nIn addition, in 2024 the Company has been pursuing extensive targeted marketing activities, including online advertisements, direct outreach campaigns and participation in major pharmaceutical conferences, such as BIO Europe Spring in Barcelona (March 2024), the BioMed Israel conference in Tel Aviv, Israel (May 2024), and Bio Europe in Stockholm Sweden (November 2024) at which the Company marketed its CDMO services and met with prospective clients for its CDMO business unit, potential partners for its R&D pipeline and potential investors.\n\nThe Company's CDMO unit is currently focused both on executing drug development projects for its clients and on validating its processes and facilities as required by cGMP standards.\n\n**R &D business unit - Pipeline Development**\n\nOn June 4, 2024, the Company met for a scientific advisory meeting with the Paul Erlich Institute (the PEI) of Germany, the scientific advice of which is considered acceptable guidance for IMPD filing with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and is also considered the European comparable to a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in the U.S. Consequently, on July 23, 2024, the Company announced the receipt of positive regulatory feedback from the PEI for its drug development program towards Phase 1/2a clinical trial of its anti-IL-17A/F nanoAb (SCN-1) in Plaque Psoriasis. The Phase 1/2a study is expected to include approximately 24 plaque psoriasis patients and is expected to commence in the second half of 2025 with readout in 2026. \n\nOn July 15, 2024, the Company announced promising results from its pre-clinical, in-vivo proof of concept study in plaque psoriasis, conducted by the team of Prof. Amos Gilhar at the internationally renowned Skin Research Laboratory at the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa. The statistical analysis of psoriasis markers measured in the study confirmed that the effect of Scinai's nanoAb was similar to that of the two comparator drugs. This supports the hypothesis that intralesional injection of a nanoAb blocking the IL-17 cytokine can positively impact the inflammatory cytokine cascade, leading to a reduction in psoriatic lesion severity and improvement in skin integrity. By delivering a biological treatment directly into psoriatic lesions, the Company aims to improve disease management for patients suffering from mild to moderate plaque psoriasis and those with psoriatic lesions in hard-to-treat areas (such as the scalp, genitals, palms of hands, and soles of feet). This approach offers the high potency and specificity advantages of biologic drugs while providing a safer and more convenient treatment option compared to existing therapies for this patient category. On September 26, 2024, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a Current Report on Form 6-K disclosing that it had entered into a license agreement with an unaffiliated U.S. private company (\"Licensee\"), pursuant to which Scinai has granted Licensee exclusive global rights to certain patents and know-how under Scinai's agreement with the Max Planck Society and the University Medical Center Göttingen for the development and commercialization of licensed products in exchange for an up-front license fee payable by the Licensee's completion of specified pre-clinical work, as well as other contingent development milestone payments across several indications and royalties on net sales of licensed products.\n\nAdditional nanoAbs for the treatment of additional autoimmune diseases, such as asthma, atopic dermatitis and wet AMD, have been discovered and characterized at the Max Planck Institute in Gottingen and the University Medical Center Göttingen, both in Germany as part of their research collaboration agreement with Scinai. Scinai holds exclusive options for exclusive, world-wide licenses to develop and commercialize these nanoAbs at pre-agreed financial terms.\n\nThe Company is pursuing strategic partnerships and sublicensing options for its anti-IL-17 nanoAb for the treatment of plaque psoriasis and other potential indications and also is looking for partners to co-develop or sub license the additional nanoAbs that have been discovered and characterized. Parties interested in discussing partnering opportunities should contact the company at BD@scinai.com\n\n**Nine (9) Months of 2024 Financial Summary**\n\n  * **Revenues** for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to $452 thousands, compared to no revenues for the period of nine months ended September 30, 2023.The increase is due to the CDMO starting to generate revenues for the first time in 2024.\n\n  * **R &D expenses** for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, amounted to $4,195 thousands compared to $4,583 thousands for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

On August 21, 2024, the Company announced the closing of the Loan Restructuring Agreement with European Investment Bank converting approximately $29 million of debt to preferred equity and leaving a debt balance of €250,000 (approximately $273,000), as a result of which the Company has stockholders' equity in excess of $2.5 million. The Company is now back in full compliance with all Nasdaq listing requirements.\n\nAmir Reichman, the Company's CEO, stated: \"After quite a bit of heavy lifting we have cleaned up our balance sheet through the conversion of almost $29 million of debt into equity and regained full compliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements. This clears the path for us to focus on our promising R&D programs and our new CDMO business unit to build shareholder value. Our thanks to all who participated in this turnaround and the patience, cooperation and support shown by our stakeholders.\"\n\nAs is the policy at Nasdaq when a listed company regains compliance with the shareholders' equity rule, the Staff stated in the Notification that the Company is subject to a Mandatory Panel Monitor for a period of one year from the date of the Notification. If within that one-year monitoring period the Staff finds the Company again out of compliance with the Rule, the Company will not be permitted to provide the Staff with a plan of compliance with respect to that deficiency and the Staff will not be permitted to grant additional time for the Company to regain compliance with respect to that deficiency, and the Company will not be afforded an applicable cure or compliance period pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3).

Accordingly, on June 18, 2024, the Company presented its plan to get back into compliance with the equity requirement with the Nasdaq Hearing Panel. The plan presented to the panel included a debt-to-equity loan restructuring deal between the Company and the European Investment Bank (the \"EIB\").\n\nOn July 3rd, the Company announced that the Hearings Panel had determined to grant the Company's request to continue its listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market, subject to the Company meeting certain conditions, including filing on or before August 14, 2024, a public disclosure demonstrating compliance with the Equity Requirement. \n\nOn August 13, 2024, the Company announced that it had signed a Loan Restructuring Agreement, which included an amendment and restatement to the amended Finance Contract with the EIB. The closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. In connection with the transaction, an amount equal to approximately EUR 26.6 million (equal to approximately $29 million), including interest accrued to date, owed by the Company to the EIB under the amended Finance Contract between the parties will be converted into 1,000 preferred shares, no par value per share, of the Company (the \"Preferred Shares\"). Following such conversion, the total outstanding amount owed by the Company to the EIB will be EUR 250,000 (equal to approximately $273,000). The outstanding amount will have a maturity date of December 31, 2031, will not be prepayable in advance, and no interest accrues or is due and payable on such amount. \n\nAs a result of the transactions under the Restructuring Agreement the Company believes that not only it now has stockholders' equity substantially above the $2.5 million as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) but that, based on its unaudited proforma analysis, it will be able to maintain compliance for at least 12 months going forward.\n\nOn August 14th, the Company submitted the required documents to demonstrate compliance with the Equity requirement to the Nasdaq Hearing Panel and is now awaiting notification from the Staff.\n\n### **CDMO business unit**\n\nSince Jan 2024 we received CDMO work orders valued at approximately $600K, and we are in advanced contract discussions with several other potential clients. We maintain confidence in our sales guidance for 2024 of $1.25 million in expected revenues. As our CDMO unit is new and we are in a rapid growth stage, acquiring new clients and building our reputation and brand awareness of our CDMO services, we expect revenues from the CDMO business to increase materially in the coming years. This is also coupled with growing demand for boutique CDMO services from early-stage biotech companies looking for fast project onset at competitive pricing without compromising on meeting the most stringent scientific and quality standards.\n\nIn addition, in 2024 we have been pursuing extensive targeted marketing activities, including online advertisements, direct outreach campaigns and participation in major pharmaceutical conferences, such as BIO Europe Spring in Barcelona (March 2024), and the BioMed Israel conference in Tel Aviv, Israel (May 2024), at which we marketed our CDMO services and met potential partners for our R&D pipeline and potential investors. \n\nOur CDMO unit is currently focused both on executing drug development projects for our clients and on validating our processes and facilities to be ready for cGMP inspection by the Israeli Ministry of Health.\n\nIn June, we held a first of its kind, hands on aseptic processing course at our facility in Jerusalem in collaboration with key figures in the industry including Ms. Rachel Shimonovitz, Head of GMP inspectorate of the Israeli Ministry of Health, and ADRES Int'l Biotech, a leading Israeli regulatory and quality consulting services firm. The course attracted many senior role holders from the Israeli biotech industry who came to our facility for this two-day education and training course.\n\n**Pipeline Development**\n\nWe are aggressively advancing the NanoAb preclinical development. At the end of April 2024, we concluded an in-vivo proof of concept animal study in collaboration with Prof. Amos Gilhar, a world-renowned dermatologist of the prestigious Technion Israel Institute of Technology.\n\nOn July 15th we announced promising results as the statistical analysis of psoriasis markers measured in the study confirmed that the effect of Scinai's NanoAb was similar to that of the two comparator drugs, supporting the hypothesis that intralesional injection of a nanoAb blocking the IL-17 cytokine can positively impact the inflammatory cytokine cascade, and lead to reduction in psoriatic lesion severity and improvement of the skin's integrity. By delivering a biological treatment directly into psoriatic lesions, Scinai aims to improve disease management for patients suffering from mild to moderate plaque psoriasis by offering the high potency and specificity advantages reserved for biologic drugs while providing a safer and more convenient treatment option compared to existing therapies currently offered to this patient category.\n\nOn June 4, 2024, we met for a scientific advisory meeting with the Paul Erlich Institute (the PEI) of Germany, the scientific advice of which is considered acceptable guidance for IMPD filing with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and is also considered the European comparable to a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in the U.S. \n\nConsequently, on July 23rd we announced the receipt of positive regulatory feedback from the PEI for our drug development program towards Phase 1/2a clinical trial of our anti-IL-17A/F nanoAb (SCN-1) in Plaque Psoriasis. The minutes of meeting clarified our preclinical toxicology and clinical program for Plaque Psoriasis with intralesional injections for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate Plaque Psoriasis. The PEI had requested to see data of efficacy in blocking IL-17F and this data became available as per the Company's announcement on July 15th describing the positive in vivo proof of concept results. The PEI accepted the Company's position that toxicology studies can be conducted in pigs rather than in Non-Human Primates. The PEI also accepted the Company's position to compare the SCN-1 to placebo directly in patients with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis while skipping the need for testing in healthy volunteers, resulting in a phase 1/2a clinical trial, which will assess both safety and efficacy in the same trial. Moreover, the PEI agreed to compare SCN-1 to placebo on the same human subject, a strategy that could significantly reduce the number of patients required for the clinical trial. Last, the PEI commented that the manufacturing process looks well developed and that controls and specifications presented are acceptable.\n\nThe Phase 1/2a study is expected to include approximately 24 plaque psoriasis patients and is expected to commence in the second half of 2025 with readout in 2026 \n\nAdditional NanoAbs for treatment of additional autoimmune diseases, such as asthma, atopic dermatitis and wet AMD, have been discovered and characterized at Max Planck and University Medical Center Göttingen as part of their research collaboration agreement with Scinai. Scinai holds exclusive options for exclusive licenses at pre-agreed financial terms for each of the resulting NanoAbs.\n\nWe are pursuing strategic partnerships and sublicensing options for both our COVID-19 self-administered inhaled NanoAb, which demonstrated highly promising in vivo results in animals as both a therapeutic and prophylactic treatment, and our anti-IL-17 nanoAb for the treatment of plaque psoriasis and other potential indications.\n\n### **Q2 2024 Financial Summary**\n\n  * **R &D expenses** for the six months ended June 30, 2024, amounted to $2,788 thousand, compared to $3,449 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2023.

The Company will hold a webinar covering its Q2 2024 financial results and business update on August 20th at 11AM EDT/18:00 Israel time. Registration for the webinar can be done using the following [LINK](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/4017234746971/WN_R5vbIHBGQlCqtVNUl1Sqxg#/registration).\n\n[ ![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6422f142b82fea6c2b59c10b/c68c408b-eeb0-4e40-8674-e39a1dc6f187/Scinai_Amir_Q2+Financial+Results_linkedin+event.jpg) ](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/4017234746971/WN_R5vbIHBGQlCqtVNUl1Sqxg)\n\n[ Register to the webinar ](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/4017234746971/WN_R5vbIHBGQlCqtVNUl1Sqxg)\n\n### **Business Update & Recent Highlights****Conversion of EIB Loan into Equity and Regaining Nasdaq Compliance**\n\nOn June 7, 2024, the Company announced that on June 5, 2024, it had received formal notification from the Listing Qualification Department (the \"Staff\") of the Nasdaq Stock Market (\"Nasdaq\") that the Company remains non-compliant with the requirement in Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) that a company have stockholders' equity of at least $2.5 million, or any of the alternative requirements under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b). Accordingly, on June 18, 2024, the Company presented its plan to get back into compliance with the equity requirement with the Nasdaq Hearing Panel. The plan presented to the panel included a debt-to-equity loan restructuring deal between the Company and the European Investment Bank (the \"EIB\").\n\nOn July 3rd, the Company announced that the Hearings Panel had determined to grant the Company's request to continue its listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market, subject to the Company meeting certain conditions, including filing on or before August 14, 2024, a public disclosure demonstrating compliance with the Equity Requirement. \n\nOn August 13, 2024, the Company announced that it had signed a Loan Restructuring Agreement, which included an amendment and restatement to the amended Finance Contract with the EIB. The closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. In connection with the transaction, an amount equal to approximately EUR 26.6 million (equal to approximately $29 million), including interest accrued to date, owed by the Company to the EIB under the amended Finance Contract between the parties will be converted into 1,000 preferred shares, no par value per share, of the Company (the \"Preferred Shares\"). Following such conversion, the total outstanding amount owed by the Company to the EIB will be EUR 250,000 (equal to approximately $273,000). The outstanding amount will have a maturity date of December 31, 2031, will not be prepayable in advance, and no interest accrues or is due and payable on such amount. \n\nAs a result of the transactions under the Restructuring Agreement the Company believes that not only it now has stockholders' equity substantially above the $2.5 million as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) but that, based on its unaudited proforma analysis, it will be able to maintain compliance for at least 12 months going forward.\n\nOn August 14th, the Company submitted the required documents to demonstrate compliance with the Equity requirement to the Nasdaq Hearing Panel and is now awaiting notification from the Staff.\n\n### **CDMO business unit**\n\nSince Jan 2024 we received CDMO work orders valued at approximately $600K, and we are in advanced contract discussions with several other potential clients. We maintain confidence in our sales guidance for 2024 of $1.25 million in expected revenues. As our CDMO unit is new and we are in a rapid growth stage, acquiring new clients and building our reputation and brand awareness of our CDMO services, we expect revenues from the CDMO business to increase materially in the coming years. This is also coupled with growing demand for boutique CDMO services from early-stage biotech companies looking for fast project onset at competitive pricing without compromising on meeting the most stringent scientific and quality standards.\n\nIn addition, in 2024 we have been pursuing extensive targeted marketing activities, including online advertisements, direct outreach campaigns and participation in major pharmaceutical conferences, such as BIO Europe Spring in Barcelona (March 2024), and the BioMed Israel conference in Tel Aviv, Israel (May 2024), at which we marketed our CDMO services and met potential partners for our R&D pipeline and potential investors. \n\nOur CDMO unit is currently focused both on executing drug development projects for our clients and on validating our processes and facilities to be ready for cGMP inspection by the Israeli Ministry of Health.\n\nIn June, we held a first of its kind, hands on aseptic processing course at our facility in Jerusalem in collaboration with key figures in the industry including Ms. Rachel Shimonovitz, Head of GMP inspectorate of the Israeli Ministry of Health, and ADRES Int'l Biotech, a leading Israeli regulatory and quality consulting services firm. The course attracted many senior role holders from the Israeli biotech industry who came to our facility for this two-day education and training course.\n\n**Pipeline Development**\n\nWe are aggressively advancing the NanoAb preclinical development. At the end of April 2024, we concluded an in-vivo proof of concept animal study in collaboration with Prof. Amos Gilhar, a world-renowned dermatologist of the prestigious Technion Israel Institute of Technology.\n\nOn July 15th we announced promising results as the statistical analysis of psoriasis markers measured in the study confirmed that the effect of Scinai's NanoAb was similar to that of the two comparator drugs, supporting the hypothesis that intralesional injection of a nanoAb blocking the IL-17 cytokine can positively impact the inflammatory cytokine cascade, and lead to reduction in psoriatic lesion severity and improvement of the skin's integrity. By delivering a biological treatment directly into psoriatic lesions, Scinai aims to improve disease management for patients suffering from mild to moderate plaque psoriasis by offering the high potency and specificity advantages reserved for biologic drugs while providing a safer and more convenient treatment option compared to existing therapies currently offered to this patient category.\n\nOn June 4, 2024, we met for a scientific advisory meeting with the Paul Erlich Institute (the PEI) of Germany, the scientific advice of which is considered acceptable guidance for IMPD filing with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and is also considered the European comparable to a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in the U.S. \n\nConsequently, on July 23rd we announced the receipt of positive regulatory feedback from the PEI for our drug development program towards Phase 1/2a clinical trial of our anti-IL-17A/F nanoAb (SCN-1) in Plaque Psoriasis. The minutes of meeting clarified our preclinical toxicology and clinical program for Plaque Psoriasis with intralesional injections for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate Plaque Psoriasis. The PEI had requested to see data of efficacy in blocking IL-17F and this data became available as per the Company's announcement on July 15th describing the positive in vivo proof of concept results. The PEI accepted the Company's position that toxicology studies can be conducted in pigs rather than in Non-Human Primates. The PEI also accepted the Company's position to compare the SCN-1 to placebo directly in patients with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis while skipping the need for testing in healthy volunteers, resulting in a phase 1/2a clinical trial, which will assess both safety and efficacy in the same trial. Moreover, the PEI agreed to compare SCN-1 to placebo on the same human subject, a strategy that could significantly reduce the number of patients required for the clinical trial. Last, the PEI commented that the manufacturing process looks well developed and that controls and specifications presented are acceptable.\n\nThe Phase 1/2a study is expected to include approximately 24 plaque psoriasis patients and is expected to commence in the second half of 2025 with readout in 2026 \n\nAdditional NanoAbs for treatment of additional autoimmune diseases, such as asthma, atopic dermatitis and wet AMD, have been discovered and characterized at Max Planck and University Medical Center Göttingen as part of their research collaboration agreement with Scinai. Scinai holds exclusive options for exclusive licenses at pre-agreed financial terms for each of the resulting NanoAbs.\n\nWe are pursuing strategic partnerships and sublicensing options for both our COVID-19 self-administered inhaled NanoAb, which demonstrated highly promising in vivo results in animals as both a therapeutic and prophylactic treatment, and our anti-IL-17 nanoAb for the treatment of plaque psoriasis and other potential indications.\n\n### **Q2 2024 Financial Summary**\n\n  * **R &D expenses** for the six months ended June 30, 2024, amounted to $2,788 thousand, compared to $3,449 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2023.

The Company will hold a webinar covering its Q2 2024 financial results and business update on August 20th at 11AM EDT/18:00 Israel time.

Accordingly, on June 18, 2024, the Company presented its plan to get back into compliance with the equity requirement with the Nasdaq Hearing Panel. The plan presented to the panel included a debt-to-equity loan restructuring deal between the Company and the European Investment Bank (the \"EIB\").\n\nOn July 3rd, the Company announced that the Hearings Panel had determined to grant the Company's request to continue its listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market, subject to the Company meeting certain conditions, including filing on or before August 14, 2024, a public disclosure demonstrating compliance with the Equity Requirement. \n\nOn August 13, 2024, the Company announced that it had signed a Loan Restructuring Agreement, which included an amendment and restatement to the amended Finance Contract with the EIB. The closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. In connection with the transaction, an amount equal to approximately EUR 26.6 million (equal to approximately $29 million), including interest accrued to date, owed by the Company to the EIB under the amended Finance Contract between the parties will be converted into 1,000 preferred shares, no par value per share, of the Company (the \"Preferred Shares\"). Following such conversion, the total outstanding amount owed by the Company to the EIB will be EUR 250,000 (equal to approximately $273,000). The outstanding amount will have a maturity date of December 31, 2031, will not be prepayable in advance, and no interest accrues or is due and payable on such amount. \n\nAs a result of the transactions under the Restructuring Agreement the Company believes that not only it now has stockholders' equity substantially above the $2.5 million as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) but that, based on its unaudited proforma analysis, it will be able to maintain compliance for at least 12 months going forward.\n\nOn August 14th, the Company submitted the required documents to demonstrate compliance with the Equity requirement to the Nasdaq Hearing Panel and is now awaiting notification from the Staff.\n\n### **CDMO business unit**\n\nSince Jan 2024 we received CDMO work orders valued at approximately $600K, and we are in advanced contract discussions with several other potential clients. We maintain confidence in our sales guidance for 2024 of $1.25 million in expected revenues. As our CDMO unit is new and we are in a rapid growth stage, acquiring new clients and building our reputation and brand awareness of our CDMO services, we expect revenues from the CDMO business to increase materially in the coming years. This is also coupled with growing demand for boutique CDMO services from early-stage biotech companies looking for fast project onset at competitive pricing without compromising on meeting the most stringent scientific and quality standards.\n\nIn addition, in 2024 we have been pursuing extensive targeted marketing activities, including online advertisements, direct outreach campaigns and participation in major pharmaceutical conferences, such as BIO Europe Spring in Barcelona (March 2024), and the BioMed Israel conference in Tel Aviv, Israel (May 2024), at which we marketed our CDMO services and met potential partners for our R&D pipeline and potential investors. \n\nOur CDMO unit is currently focused both on executing drug development projects for our clients and on validating our processes and facilities to be ready for cGMP inspection by the Israeli Ministry of Health.\n\nIn June, we held a first of its kind, hands on aseptic processing course at our facility in Jerusalem in collaboration with key figures in the industry including Ms. Rachel Shimonovitz, Head of GMP inspectorate of the Israeli Ministry of Health, and ADRES Int'l Biotech, a leading Israeli regulatory and quality consulting services firm. The course attracted many senior role holders from the Israeli biotech industry who came to our facility for this two-day education and training course.\n\n**Pipeline Development**\n\nWe are aggressively advancing the NanoAb preclinical development. At the end of April 2024, we concluded an in-vivo proof of concept animal study in collaboration with Prof. Amos Gilhar, a world-renowned dermatologist of the prestigious Technion Israel Institute of Technology.\n\nOn July 15th we announced promising results as the statistical analysis of psoriasis markers measured in the study confirmed that the effect of Scinai's NanoAb was similar to that of the two comparator drugs, supporting the hypothesis that intralesional injection of a nanoAb blocking the IL-17 cytokine can positively impact the inflammatory cytokine cascade, and lead to reduction in psoriatic lesion severity and improvement of the skin's integrity. By delivering a biological treatment directly into psoriatic lesions, Scinai aims to improve disease management for patients suffering from mild to moderate plaque psoriasis by offering the high potency and specificity advantages reserved for biologic drugs while providing a safer and more convenient treatment option compared to existing therapies currently offered to this patient category.\n\nOn June 4, 2024, we met for a scientific advisory meeting with the Paul Erlich Institute (the PEI) of Germany, the scientific advice of which is considered acceptable guidance for IMPD filing with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and is also considered the European comparable to a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in the U.S. \n\nConsequently, on July 23rd we announced the receipt of positive regulatory feedback from the PEI for our drug development program towards Phase 1/2a clinical trial of our anti-IL-17A/F nanoAb (SCN-1) in Plaque Psoriasis. The minutes of meeting clarified our preclinical toxicology and clinical program for Plaque Psoriasis with intralesional injections for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate Plaque Psoriasis. The PEI had requested to see data of efficacy in blocking IL-17F and this data became available as per the Company's announcement on July 15th describing the positive in vivo proof of concept results. The PEI accepted the Company's position that toxicology studies can be conducted in pigs rather than in Non-Human Primates. The PEI also accepted the Company's position to compare the SCN-1 to placebo directly in patients with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis while skipping the need for testing in healthy volunteers, resulting in a phase 1/2a clinical trial, which will assess both safety and efficacy in the same trial. Moreover, the PEI agreed to compare SCN-1 to placebo on the same human subject, a strategy that could significantly reduce the number of patients required for the clinical trial. Last, the PEI commented that the manufacturing process looks well developed and that controls and specifications presented are acceptable.\n\nThe Phase 1/2a study is expected to include approximately 24 plaque psoriasis patients and is expected to commence in the second half of 2025 with readout in 2026 \n\nAdditional NanoAbs for treatment of additional autoimmune diseases, such as asthma, atopic dermatitis and wet AMD, have been discovered and characterized at Max Planck and University Medical Center Göttingen as part of their research collaboration agreement with Scinai.
