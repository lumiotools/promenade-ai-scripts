(Nasdaq: BMRN) today announced positive and consistent results from multiple real-world evidence studies of VOXZOGO® (vosoritide) in children with achondroplasia. These results, as well as data from the investigational research program for VOXZOGO in hypochondroplasia, were presented at the 62nd Annual European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE) Meeting in Liverpool, England, Nov. 16-18, 2024. \n\n[ ![BioMarin Pharmaceutical logo \\(PRNewsfoto/BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/534018/BioMarin_Pharmaceutical_Inc_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/534018/BioMarin_Pharmaceutical_Inc_Logo.html)\n\n\"The extensive clinical data supporting VOXZOGO in children with achondroplasia are well-known, and at ESPE, we shared further results in children who greatly benefited from the medicine in a real-world setting,\" said Klaus Mohnike, M.D., Ph.D., pediatric endocrinologist at Children's Hospital, Otto-von-Guericke-University in Magdeburg, Germany. \"Furthermore, the breadth of clinical and real-world evidence underscores why we continue to advocate for treatment with VOXZOGO as early as possible.\"\n\nReal-world longitudinal data from the achondroplasia module of the European CrescNet registry involving 452 children at 30 centers across eight countries showed outcomes of treatment with VOXZOGO were consistent with previously reported clinical trials. The median age at time of enrollment was 6.12 years. Among 143 participants treated with VOXZOGO for 12 months, the average height increase was 6.36 centimeters (cm), with a height Z-score improvement of 0.7 compared to an achondroplasia reference population. For 73 participants treated for 24 months, the average height increase was 11.86 cm, with a height Z-score improvement of 1.15 compared to the same reference population.\n\nIn addition, in a real-world study in France that included 62 children, results from 17 children above the age of 5 (for whom data is available for 18 months after initial treatment) showed continued efficacy of VOXZOGO. The children who received VOXZOGO experienced an 8.76 cm increase in height, on average, and experienced a mean 0.56 improvement in Z-score compared to an untreated natural history population with achondroplasia and a 0.44 improvement in Z-score compared to a general U.S. population, indicating progress in height compared to the untreated population. The average annualized growth velocity was 5.85 cm/year, representing a substantial improvement in growth-related development over time. There were no discontinuations, and longer-term safety and effectiveness will continue to be monitored.\n\n\"These real-world data further reinforce the value of VOXZOGO as the first and only approved treatment for children, including infants, with achondroplasia,\" said Greg Friberg, M.D., executive vice president and chief research & development officer at BioMarin. \"We have now collected more than 6,000 patient-years of safety data through our industry-leading CANOPY clinical program, providing the scientific basis for the rapid development of VOXZOGO in new indications such as hypochondroplasia, where we hope to replicate our success in achondroplasia.\"\n\nKey presentations for VOXZOGO in achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia at ESPE, including two oral presentations and four poster presentations, are listed below, with all times in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT):\n\n**_Oral Presentations_****Phase 2 Trial of Vosoritide Use in Patients with Hypochondroplasia: Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis from 12 Month Data** Abstract #FC5.5Saturday, Nov. 16 at 3:35 p.m. \n\n**Expansion of the CrescNet Registry Achondroplasia Module: Real-World Demographic Data and Outcomes After Up to 2 Years of Vosoritide Treatment** Abstract #FC2.6Saturday, Nov. 16 at 3:45 p.m.\n\n**_Poster Presentations_**\n\n**Real-World Effectiveness of Vosoritide in Children with Achondroplasia: Results from 18 Months Follow-Up in France** Abstract #P2-56\n\n**Patient-Centered Data Collection Provides Comprehensive Insights into Healthcare Resource Use in Achondroplasia: Data From the Pilot Phase of the VIrtual STudy in Achondroplasia (VISTA)** Abstract #P1-118\n\n**Design and Objectives of Study 111-902: a Multicenter, Prospective and Retrospective Observational Study of Children with Hypochondroplasia** Abstract #P3-164\n\n**Comparison of the Diagnostic Yield of Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) and Targeted Panel Sequencing for Children with Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS)** Abstract #P1-61\n\n**About the CANOPY Clinical Program**\n\nThe CANOPY clinical program was designed to evaluate the potential of VOXZOGO (vosoritide) in children with various genetic skeletal conditions, including achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, Noonan syndrome, SHOX deficiency, Turner syndrome and idiopathic short stature, with the goal of addressing the unmet needs of and expanding treatment options for children and families impacted by these conditions.\n\nStudies underway as part of the CANOPY program beyond achondroplasia include:\n\n  * CANOPY HCH-OS, a multinational observational study in children with hypochondroplasia.\n  * CANOPY HCH-3, a Phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind multicenter study in children with hypochondroplasia.\n  * CANOPY ISS-OS, a multinational observational study in children with idiopathic short stature.\n  * CANOPY ISS-2, a Phase 2 randomized, controlled, multicenter study in children with idiopathic short stature.\n  * CANOPY NS, TS, SHOX-D-2, a Phase 2 study in multiple genetic skeletal conditions including Noonan syndrome, Turner syndrome and SHOX deficiency.\n\n\n\n**About VOXZOGO**\n\nIn children with achondroplasia, endochondral bone growth, an essential process by which bone tissue is created, is negatively regulated due to a gain of function mutation in _FGFR3_. VOXZOGO, a C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) analog, acts as a positive regulator of the signaling pathway downstream of FGFR3 to promote endochondral bone growth.\n\nVOXZOGO is approved in the U.S., Japan and Australia to increase linear growth in children of all ages with achondroplasia with open epiphyses, and VOXZOGO is indicated in the EU for the treatment of achondroplasia in children 4 months of age and older whose epiphyses are not closed, as confirmed by appropriate genetic testing. In the U.S., this indication is approved under accelerated approval based on an improvement in annualized growth velocity. Continued approval may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s). To fulfill this post-marketing requirement, BioMarin intends to use the ongoing open-label extension studies compared to available natural history.\n\nTo date, approximately 3,800 infants and children with achondroplasia around the world have received VOXZOGO.\n\n**Patient Support Accessing VOXZOGO**\n\nTo reach a BioMarin RareConnections® Case Manager, please call, toll-free, 1-833-VOXZOGO (1-833-869-9646) or e-mail VOXZOGOSupport@biomarin-rareconnections.com.

For additional information regarding this product, please contact BioMarin Medical Information at medinfo@bmrn.com.\n\n**About Achondroplasia**\n\nAchondroplasia is a rare genetic skeletal condition caused by a variation in the _FGFR3_ gene. It is characterized by disproportionate short stature and a potentially high burden of complications related to impaired endochondral bone growth.\n\nApproximately 80% of children with achondroplasia are born to parents of average stature as a result of a spontaneous variation in the _FGFR3_ gene. The worldwide incidence of achondroplasia is around one in 25,000 live births.\n\n**VOXZOGO U.S. Important Safety Information**\n\n**_What is VOXZOGO used for?_**\n\n  * VOXZOGO is a prescription medicine used to increase linear growth in children with achondroplasia and open growth plates (epiphyses).\n  * VOXZOGO is approved under accelerated approval based on an improvement in annualized growth velocity. Continued approval may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.\n\n\n\n**_What is the most important safety information about VOXZOGO?_**\n\n  * VOXZOGO may cause serious side effects including a temporary decrease in blood pressure in some patients. To reduce the risk of a decrease in blood pressure and associated symptoms (dizziness, feeling tired, or nausea), patients should eat a meal and drink 8 to 10 ounces of fluid within 1 hour before receiving VOXZOGO.\n\n\n\n**_What are the most common side effects of VOXZOGO?_**\n\n  * The most common side effects of VOXZOGO include injection site reactions (including redness, itching, swelling, bruising, rash, hives, and injection site pain), high levels of blood alkaline phosphatase shown in blood tests, vomiting, joint pain, decreased blood pressure, and stomachache. These are not all the possible side effects of VOXZOGO. Ask your healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects, and about any side effects that bother the patient or that do not go away.\n\n\n\n**_How is VOXZOGO taken?_**\n\n  * VOXZOGO is taken daily as an injection given under the skin, administered by a caregiver after a healthcare provider determines the caregiver is able to administer VOXZOGO. Do not try to inject VOXZOGO until you have been shown the right way by your healthcare provider. VOXZOGO is supplied with Instructions for Use that describe the steps for preparing, injecting, and disposing VOXZOGO. Caregivers should review the Instructions for Use for guidance and any time they receive a refill of VOXZOGO in case any changes have been made.\n  * Inject VOXZOGO 1 time every day, at about the same time each day. If a dose of VOXZOGO is missed, it can be given within 12 hours from the missed dose. After 12 hours, skip the missed dose and administer the next daily dose as usual.\n  * The dose of VOXZOGO is based on body weight. Your healthcare provider will adjust the dose based on changes in weight following regular check-ups.\n  * Your healthcare provider will monitor the patient's growth and tell you when to stop taking VOXZOGO if they determine the patient is no longer able to grow. Stop administering VOXZOGO if instructed by your healthcare provider.\n\n\n\n**_What should you tell the doctor before or during taking VOXZOGO?_**\n\n  * Tell your doctor about all of the patient's medical conditions including\n    * If the patient has heart disease (cardiac or vascular disease), or if the patient is on blood pressure medicine (anti-hypertensive medicine).\n    * If the patient has kidney problems or renal impairment.\n    * If the patient is pregnant or plans to become pregnant. It is not known if VOXZOGO will harm the unborn baby.\n    * If the patient is breastfeeding or plans to breastfeed. It is not known if VOXZOGO passes into breast milk.\n  * Tell your doctor about all of the medicines the patient takes, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.\n\n\n\nYou may report side effects to BioMarin at 1-866-906-6100. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

(NASDAQ: BMRN) today announced financial results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n[ ![BioMarin Pharmaceutical logo \\(PRNewsfoto/BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/534018/BioMarin_Pharmaceutical_Inc_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/534018/BioMarin_Pharmaceutical_Inc_Logo.html)\n\n\"The strategic and operational decisions we have made over the last nine months are driving strong performance, reflected in year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of 28% and accelerated profitability,\" said Alexander Hardy, President and Chief Executive Officer of BioMarin. \"We are executing on our new corporate strategy, focused on Innovation, Growth, and Value Commitment, as demonstrated by another quarter of strong financial performance and clinical progress as we advance potential new medicines for the patients we serve.\"\n\nMr. Hardy added, \"Strong global demand for VOXZOGO led to over 3,800 infants and children receiving treatment as of the end of the third quarter. In the U.S., the majority of new patient starts in the third quarter were for children under 5 years of age, reflecting strong adoption from families seeking VOXZOGO therapy for their infants and young children. Our Enzyme Therapies portfolio also delivered impressive results, with third quarter revenue growth of 27% year-over-year, evidence of the continued growth potential of this portfolio,\" added Mr. Hardy. \"Additionally, we made good progress advancing all of our innovative therapies under development. Within our CANOPY clinical program, we advanced our studies in five new indications with VOXZOGO. For hypochondroplasia, we are on track to complete enrollment in the Phase 3 registration-enabling study in the first half of 2025.\"\n\n**_Financial Highlights:_**\n\n  * **Total Revenues** for the third quarter of 2024 were $746 million, an increase of 28%, compared to the same period in 2023, driven by strong VOXZOGO contributions from new patient starts in all regions. In the quarter, revenues from BioMarin's Enzyme Therapies (VIMIZIM®, NAGLAZYME®, ALDURAZYME®, BRINEURA® and PALYNZIQ®) increased 27% compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase was driven by a combination of the timing of order fulfillment to Sanofi as the company recognizes ALDURAZYME revenues when the product is released and control is transferred to Sanofi, increased patient demand, and the timing of large government orders in certain regions outside the U.S. Partially offsetting the increase were lower KUVAN® product revenues attributed to continued generic competition as a result of the loss of market exclusivity in 2022. \n  * **GAAP Net Income** increased by $66 million to $106 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher gross profit driven by the factors noted above. The increase was partially offset by higher spend in Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A), primarily due to severance and other restructuring costs associated with organizational redesign efforts executed during the third quarter of 2024, higher income tax expense and the impact of ROCTAVIAN® inventory reserves on Cost of Sales.\n\n\n  * **Non-GAAP Income** increased by $89 million to $178 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in Non-GAAP Income was primarily due to higher gross profit and lower SG&A expenses primarily related to sales and marketing activities for ROCTAVIAN outside of the U.S., Germany and Italy as the company executes on its updated strategy to focus commercial launch efforts on those three countries. The increase was partially offset by higher income tax expense and the impact of ROCTAVIAN inventory reserves on Cost of Sales.\n\n\n\n**_3Q'24 Execution on New Corporate Strategy: Innovation, Growth, and Value Commitment_**\n\n**Innovation**\n\n  * **Skeletal Conditions:** During the quarter, BioMarin advanced development across its CANOPY clinical program with VOXZOGO (vosoritide) in idiopathic short stature, Noonan syndrome, Turner syndrome, and SHOX deficiency, with the pivotal study in hypochondroplasia expected to complete enrollment in the first half of 2025. BioMarin's long-acting C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), BMN 333, remains on track for initiation of the first-in-human study in early 2025.\n\n\n\nAt the 16th International Skeletal Dysplasia Society meeting (ISDS) in September, BioMarin and its external research partners contributed to eight presentations (including four orals) discussing the value of vosoritide and the burden of illness in achondroplasia and related disorders. These data included showing that children with achondroplasia treated with VOXZOGO experienced meaningful improvements in addition to height, such as gains in health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and increased bone length while maintaining bone strength. Researchers also presented encouraging data from ongoing investigator-led studies of treatment in children with other genetic skeletal conditions, including hypochondroplasia and Noonan syndrome, as well as those with genetic variants often associated with idiopathic short stature such as aggrecan (ACAN) deficiency and heterozygous NPR2 mutations.\n\n  * **Other Clinical Pipeline Programs:** With BMN 351, BioMarin's next generation oligonucleotide for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, the program has completed enrollment into the first dose cohort and initial proof-of-concept data is expected in 2025 (including muscle dystrophin levels after 25 weeks of dosing). With BMN 349, an oral therapeutic for Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)-associated liver disease, the program completed the single-ascending dose (SAD) phase of the first-in-human study and is expected to start dosing the multiple-ascending dose (MAD) phase of the study by end of the year. Enrollment is complete in the phase 3 study with PALYNZIQ in adolescents ages 12-17, and the study is on track for data readout in 2025 to support a potential U.S. Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) in the second half of the year.\n\n\n  * **Pre-clinical Programs:** With BMN 390, a compound for phenylketonuria which may lower hypersensitivity and enhance exposure, an IND is expected to be submitted in the second half of 2025. With BMN 370, a targeted nanobody for the prevention of bleeding in patients with low levels of von Willebrand factor levels, the company is progressing with pre-clinical work and targeting a potential IND submission for the second half of 2025.\n\n\n\n**Growth**\n\n  * As of the end of the third quarter, over 3,800 children globally, many from infancy, were receiving VOXZOGO for the treatment of achondroplasia. VOXZOGO's broad label has been especially important to those families pursuing maximum therapeutic benefit by beginning therapy at an early age.\n\n\n  * In the U.S., the largest single market opportunity, the majority of new patient starts in the quarter were for children under the age of 5 years. VOXZOGO's extensive safety and efficacy profile led more families to begin therapeutic intervention early to potentially impact craniofacial volume, foramen magnum area, body proportionality and quality of life, in addition to durable increases in growth velocity.\n\n\n  * Achondroplasia represents a global 24,000 total addressable patient population (TAPP). While the U.S. is the largest single market opportunity, markets outside of the U.S. represent approximately 90% of eligible patients. BioMarin is in the process of pursuing VOXZOGO access into more than 20 additional countries by 2027, providing the opportunity for even more children of all ages to benefit from the only approved medicine for the treatment of achondroplasia.\n\n\n  * Enzyme Therapies continue to be a significant driver of growth, with revenues increasing 13% year-to-date, compared to the same period in 2023. As outlined at Investor Day, BioMarin is implementing new initiatives to drive sustained growth of the Enzyme Therapies across the approximately 80 countries where these medicines are available.\n\n\n\n**Value Commitment**\n\n  * During the quarter, the company made significant progress executing its financial strategy to deliver on its value commitment to stakeholders. Year-to-date, BioMarin's GAAP Operating Margin of 15.3% expanded 6.4 percentage points Y/Y and Non-GAAP Operating Margin of 27.7% expanded 7.6 percentage points Y/Y while GAAP Diluted EPS of $1.56 increased 103% Y/Y and Non-GAAP Diluted EPS of $2.60 increased 63% Y/Y. These measures of profitability increased at rates faster than revenue growth, representing the company's focus on operational efficiency.\n\n\n  * During the quarter, the company continued to benefit from its ongoing $500 million cost transformation program announced at Investor Day through the impact of prioritized program decisions and ongoing execution of the enterprise-wide reorganization.\n\n\n  * The company generated operating cash flows totaling $221 million in the third quarter, an increase of 63% compared to the same period last year. Total cash and investments at the end of the third quarter were approximately $1.5 billion, and with its increasing profitability, BioMarin is positioned to generate increasing operating cash flow into the future. In addition, BioMarin settled $495 million of convertible debt in cash during the quarter as planned, resulting in the retirement of approximately four million potentially dilutive shares. This was the first time that BioMarin retired a convertible note without issuing a new convertible instrument, thereby returning value to shareholders.\n\n\n  * Today, BioMarin increased full-year 2024 guidance for Total Revenues, Non-GAAP Operating Margin, and Non-GAAP Diluted EPS. The updated guidance highlights the sustained strong demand for VOXZOGO and growth trajectory of Enzyme Therapies, as well as BioMarin's commitment to expand profitability while investing in innovation.\n\n\n  * During the quarter, BioMarin reaffirmed long-term guidance and outlook previously provided at Investor Day on September 4, 2024, targeting:\n\n\n  *     * Approximately $4 billion in Total Revenues in 2027;\n\n\n  *     * 40% Non-GAAP Operating Margin(1) starting in 2026 and growing to the low- to mid-40% range over time;\n\n\n  *     * More than $1.25 billion operating cash flow per year starting in 2027;\n\n\n  *     * Mid-teen compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for total revenues through 2034; and\n\n\n  *     * Treatments for Skeletal Conditions to represent a greater than $5 billion revenue opportunity over time.\n\n\n\n(1) | Refer to Non-GAAP Information beginning on page 10 of this press release for a complete discussion of the company's Non-GAAP financial information.

Non-GAAP Income is defined by the company as GAAP Net Income excluding amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and, in certain periods, certain other specified items, as detailed below when applicable. The company also includes a Non-GAAP adjustment for the estimated tax impact of the reconciling items. Non-GAAP Operating Margin percentage is defined by the company as GAAP Income from Operations, excluding amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and, in certain periods, certain other specified items, divided by GAAP Total Revenues. Non-GAAP Diluted EPS is defined by the company as Non-GAAP Income divided by Non-GAAP Weighted-Average Diluted Shares Outstanding. Non-GAAP Weighted-Average Diluted Shares Outstanding is defined by the company as GAAP Weighted-Average Diluted Shares Outstanding, adjusted to include any common shares issuable under the company's equity plans and convertible debt in periods when they are dilutive under Non-GAAP. The company's presentation of percentage changes in total revenues at Constant Currency rates, which is computed using current period local currency sales at the prior period's foreign exchange rates, is also a Non-GAAP financial measure. This measure provides information about growth (or declines) in the company's total revenue as if foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior period and the current period.\n\nBioMarin regularly uses both GAAP and Non-GAAP results and expectations internally to assess its financial operating performance and evaluate key business decisions related to its principal business activities: the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing and sale of innovative biologic therapies. Because Non-GAAP Income, Non-GAAP Operating Margin percentage, Non-GAAP Diluted EPS, Non-GAAP Weighted-Average Diluted Shares Outstanding and Constant Currency are important internal measurements for BioMarin, the company believes that providing this information in conjunction with BioMarin's GAAP information enhances investors' and analysts' ability to meaningfully compare the company's results from period to period and to its forward-looking guidance, and to identify operating trends in the company's principal business. BioMarin also uses Non-GAAP Income internally to understand, manage and evaluate its business and to make operating decisions, and compensation of executives is based in part on this measure.\n\nNon-GAAP Income and its components are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to comparable GAAP measures and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors should note that the Non-GAAP information is not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and does not reflect all of the amounts associated with the company's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors should also note that these Non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. In addition, from time to time in the future there may be other items that the company may exclude for purposes of its Non-GAAP financial measures; likewise, the company may in the future cease to exclude items that it has historically excluded for purposes of its Non-GAAP financial measures. Because of the non-standardized definitions, the Non-GAAP financial measure as used by BioMarin in this press release and the accompanying tables may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nThe following tables present the reconciliation of GAAP reported to Non-GAAP adjusted financial information:\n\n**Reconciliation of GAAP Reported Net Income to Non-GAAP Income(1)** **(In millions of U.S. dollars)** **(unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended** **September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**GAAP Reported Net Income** | **$ 106** | **$ 40** | **$ 302** | **$ 147**  \nAdjustments  \nStock-based compensation expense - COS | 5 | 4 | 12 | 13  \nStock-based compensation expense - R&D | 11 | 14 | 45 | 49  \nStock-based compensation expense - SG&A | 27 | 30 | 93 | 90  \nAmortization of intangible assets | 5 | 16 | 34 | 47  \nGain on sale of nonfinancial assets (2) | — | — | (10) | —  \nSeverance and restructuring costs (3) | 44 | (1) | 86 | (1)  \nLoss on investments (4) | — | — | 5 | 13  \nIncome tax effect of adjustments | (20) | (16) | (61) | (48)  \nNon-GAAP Income | $ 178 | $ 89 | $ 506 | $ 310  \n  \n**Reconciliation of Certain GAAP Reported Information to Non-GAAP Information(1)** **(in millions of U.S. dollars, except per share data)** **(unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended** **September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2024**  \n**Dollar** | **Percentage** | **Dollar** | **Percentage**  \n**GAAP Change in Total Revenues** | **$ 165** | **28 %** | **$ 334** | **19 %**  \nAdjustment for unfavorable impact of foreign currency  exchange rates on product sales denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars | 23 | 75  \nNon-GAAP change in Total Revenues at Constant Currency | $ 188 | 32 % | $ 409 | 23 %  \n  \n**Three Months Ended** **September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **Percent** **of GAAP** **Total** **Revenue** | **2023** | **Percent** **of****GAAP** **Total** **Revenue** | **2024** | **Percent** **of****GAAP** **Total** **Revenue** | **2023** | **Percent** **of****GAAP** **Total** **Revenue**  \n**GAAP Income from Operations** | **$ 114** | **15.3 %** | **$ 31** | **5.3 %** | **$ 323** | **15.3 %** | **$ 158** | **8.9 %**  \nAdjustments  \nStock-based compensation expense | 43 | 5.7 | 48 | 8.3 | 150 | 7.2 | 152 | 8.6  \nAmortization of intangible assets | 5 | 0.7 | 16 | 2.8 | 34 | 1.6 | 47 | 2.7  \nGain on sale of nonfinancial assets (2) | — | — | — | — | (10) | (0.5) | — | —  \nSeverance and restructuring costs (3) | 45 | 6.0 | (1) | (0.2) | 87 | 4.1 | (1) | (0.1)  \nNon-GAAP Income from Operations | $ 207 | 27.7 % | $ 94 | 16.2 % | $ 583 | 27.7 % | $ 357 | 20.1 %  \n  \n**Three Months Ended** **September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**GAAP Diluted EPS** | **$ 0.55** | **$ 0.21** | **$ 1.56** | **$ 0.77**  \nAdjustments  \nStock-based compensation expense | 0.22 | 0.24 | 0.76 | 0.76  \nAmortization of intangible assets | 0.03 | 0.08 | 0.17 | 0.24  \nGain on sale of nonfinancial assets (2) | — | — | (0.05) | —  \nSeverance and restructuring costs (3) | 0.22 | — | 0.44 | —  \nLoss on investments (4) | — | — | 0.03 | 0.06  \nIncome tax effect of adjustments | (0.11) | (0.07) | (0.31) | (0.23)  \nNon-GAAP Diluted EPS | $ 0.91 | $ 0.46 | $ 2.60 | $ 1.60  \n  \n(1) | Certain amounts may not sum or recalculate due to rounding.  \n---|---  \n(2) | Represents a payment triggered by a third party's attainment of a regulatory approval milestone related to previously sold intangible assets.  \n(3) | These amounts were included in SG&A and represent severance and restructuring costs related to the company's 2024 portfolio strategy review and the associated organizational redesign efforts announced in the second and third quarters of 2024.

(NASDAQ: BMRN) today announced financial\nresults for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n“The strategic and operational decisions we have made over the last nine months are driving strong performance,\nreflected in year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of 28% and accelerated profitability,” said Alexander\nHardy, President and Chief Executive Officer of BioMarin. “We are executing on our new corporate strategy, focused\non Innovation, Growth, and Value Commitment, as demonstrated by another quarter of strong financial performance\nand clinical progress as we advance potential new medicines for the patients we serve.”\nMr. Hardy added, “Strong global demand for VOXZOGO led to over 3,800 infants and children receiving treatment as\nof the end of the third quarter. In the U.S., the majority of new patient starts in the third quarter were for children under\n5 years of age, reflecting strong adoption from families seeking VOXZOGO therapy for their infants and young\nchildren. Our Enzyme Therapies portfolio also delivered impressive results, with third quarter revenue growth of 27%\nyear-over-year, evidence of the continued growth potential of this portfolio,” added Mr. Hardy. “Additionally, we made\ngood progress advancing all of our innovative therapies under development. Within our CANOPY clinical program, we\nadvanced our studies in five new indications with VOXZOGO. For hypochondroplasia, we are on track to complete\nenrollment in the Phase 3 registration-enabling study in the first half of 2025.”\n1\nFinancial Highlights:\n• Total Revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were $746 million, an increase of 28%, compared to the same\nperiod in 2023, driven by strong VOXZOGO contributions from new patient starts in all regions. In the quarter,\nrevenues from BioMarin’s Enzyme Therapies (VIMIZIM®, NAGLAZYME®, ALDURAZYME®, BRINEURA® and\nPALYNZIQ®) increased 27% compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase was driven by a combination\nof the timing of order fulfillment to Sanofi as the company recognizes ALDURAZYME revenues when the\nproduct is released and control is transferred to Sanofi, increased patient demand, and the timing of large\ngovernment orders in certain regions outside the U.S. Partially offsetting the increase were lower KUVAN®\nproduct revenues attributed to continued generic competition as a result of the loss of market exclusivity in\n2022.\n• GAAP Net Income increased by $66 million to $106 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same\nperiod in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher gross profit driven by the factors noted above. The\nincrease was partially offset by higher spend in Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A), primarily due to\nseverance and other restructuring costs associated with organizational redesign efforts executed during the\nthird quarter of 2024, higher income tax expense and the impact of ROCTAVIAN® inventory reserves on Cost\nof Sales.\n• Non-GAAP Income increased by $89 million to $178 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the\nsame period in 2023. The increase in Non-GAAP Income was primarily due to higher gross profit and lower\nSG&A expenses primarily related to sales and marketing activities for ROCTAVIAN outside of the U.S.,\nGermany and Italy as the company executes on its updated strategy to focus commercial launch efforts on\nthose three countries. The increase was partially offset by higher income tax expense and the impact of\nROCTAVIAN inventory reserves on Cost of Sales.\n3Q’24 Execution on New Corporate Strategy: Innovation, Growth, and Value Commitment\nInnovation\n• Skeletal Conditions: During the quarter, BioMarin advanced development across its CANOPY clinical\nprogram with VOXZOGO (vosoritide) in idiopathic short stature, Noonan syndrome, Turner syndrome, and\nSHOX deficiency, with the pivotal study in hypochondroplasia expected to complete enrollment in the first half\nof 2025. BioMarin’s long-acting C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), BMN 333, remains on track for initiation of\nthe first-in-human study in early 2025.\nAt the 16th International Skeletal Dysplasia Society meeting (ISDS) in September, BioMarin and its external\nresearch partners contributed to eight presentations (including four orals) discussing the value of vosoritide\nand the burden of illness in achondroplasia and related disorders. These data included showing that children\nwith achondroplasia treated with VOXZOGO experienced meaningful improvements in addition to height,\nsuch as gains in health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and increased bone length while maintaining bone\nstrength. Researchers also presented encouraging data from ongoing investigator-led studies of treatment in\nchildren with other genetic skeletal conditions, including hypochondroplasia and Noonan syndrome, as well as\nthose with genetic variants often associated with idiopathic short stature such as aggrecan (ACAN) deficiency\nand heterozygous NPR2 mutations.\n• Other Clinical Pipeline Programs: With BMN 351, BioMarin’s next generation oligonucleotide for Duchenne\nMuscular Dystrophy, the program has completed enrollment into the first dose cohort and initial proof-of-\nconcept data is expected in 2025 (including muscle dystrophin levels after 25 weeks of dosing). With BMN\n349, an oral therapeutic for Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)-associated liver disease, the program\ncompleted the single-ascending dose (SAD) phase of the first-in-human study and is expected to start dosing\nthe multiple-ascending dose (MAD) phase of the study by end of the year. Enrollment is complete in the\nphase 3 study with PALYNZIQ in adolescents ages 12-17, and the study is on track for data readout in 2025\nto support a potential U.S. Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) in the second half of the year.\n2\n• Pre-clinical Programs: With BMN 390, a compound for phenylketonuria which may lower hypersensitivity\nand enhance exposure, an IND is expected to be submitted in the second half of 2025. With BMN 370, a\ntargeted nanobody for the prevention of bleeding in patients with low levels of von Willebrand factor levels,\nthe company is progressing with pre-clinical work and targeting a potential IND submission for the second half\nof 2025.\nGrowth\n• As of the end of the third quarter, over 3,800 children globally, many from infancy, were receiving VOXZOGO\nfor the treatment of achondroplasia. VOXZOGO’s broad label has been especially important to those families\npursuing maximum therapeutic benefit by beginning therapy at an early age.\n• In the U.S., the largest single market opportunity, the majority of new patient starts in the quarter were for\nchildren under the age of 5 years. VOXZOGO's extensive safety and efficacy profile led more families to\nbegin therapeutic intervention early to potentially impact craniofacial volume, foramen magnum area, body\nproportionality and quality of life, in addition to durable increases in growth velocity.\n• Achondroplasia represents a global 24,000 total addressable patient population (TAPP). While the U.S. is the\nlargest single market opportunity, markets outside of the U.S. represent approximately 90% of eligible\npatients. BioMarin is in the process of pursuing VOXZOGO access into more than 20 additional countries by\n2027, providing the opportunity for even more children of all ages to benefit from the only approved medicine\nfor the treatment of achondroplasia.\n• Enzyme Therapies continue to be a significant driver of growth, with revenues increasing 13% year-to-date,\ncompared to the same period in 2023. As outlined at Investor Day, BioMarin is implementing new initiatives to\ndrive sustained growth of the Enzyme Therapies across the approximately 80 countries where these\nmedicines are available.\nValue Commitment\n• During the quarter, the company made significant progress executing its financial strategy to deliver on its\nvalue commitment to stakeholders. Year-to-date, BioMarin’s GAAP Operating Margin of 15.3% expanded 6.4\npercentage points Y/Y and Non-GAAP Operating Margin of 27.7% expanded 7.6 percentage points Y/Y while\nGAAP Diluted EPS of $1.56 increased 103% Y/Y and Non-GAAP Diluted EPS of $2.60 increased 63% Y/Y.\nThese measures of profitability increased at rates faster than revenue growth, representing the company’s\nfocus on operational efficiency.\n• During the quarter, the company continued to benefit from its ongoing $500 million cost transformation\nprogram announced at Investor Day through the impact of prioritized program decisions and ongoing\nexecution of the enterprise-wide reorganization.\n• The company generated operating cash flows totaling $221 million in the third quarter, an increase of 63%\ncompared to the same period last year. Total cash and investments at the end of the third quarter were\napproximately $1.5 billion, and with its increasing profitability, BioMarin is positioned to generate increasing\noperating cash flow into the future. In addition, BioMarin settled $495 million of convertible debt in cash during\nthe quarter as planned, resulting in the retirement of approximately four million potentially dilutive shares. This\nwas the first time that BioMarin retired a convertible note without issuing a new convertible instrument,\nthereby returning value to shareholders.\n3\n• Today, BioMarin increased full-year 2024 guidance for Total Revenues, Non-GAAP Operating Margin, and\nNon-GAAP Diluted EPS. The updated guidance highlights the sustained strong demand for VOXZOGO and\ngrowth trajectory of Enzyme Therapies, as well as BioMarin's commitment to expand profitability while\ninvesting in innovation.\n• During the quarter, BioMarin reaffirmed long-term guidance and outlook previously provided at Investor Day\non September 4, 2024, targeting:\n◦ Approximately $4 billion in Total Revenues in 2027;\n◦ 40% Non-GAAP Operating Margin(1) starting in 2026 and growing to the low- to mid-40% range over\ntime;\n◦ More than $1.25 billion operating cash flow per year starting in 2027;\n◦ Mid-teen compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for total revenues through 2034; and\n◦ Treatments for Skeletal Conditions to represent a greater than $5 billion revenue opportunity over time.\n(1) Refer to Non-GAAP Information beginning on page 10 of this press release for a complete discussion of the company’s Non-\nGAAP financial information.

Non-GAAP\nIncome is defined by the company as GAAP Net Income excluding amortization of intangible assets, stock-based\ncompensation expense and, in certain periods, certain other specified items, as detailed below when applicable. The\ncompany also includes a Non-GAAP adjustment for the estimated tax impact of the reconciling items. Non-GAAP\nOperating Margin percentage is defined by the company as GAAP Income from Operations, excluding amortization of\nintangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and, in certain periods, certain other specified items, divided by\nGAAP Total Revenues. Non-GAAP Diluted EPS is defined by the company as Non-GAAP Income divided by Non-\nGAAP Weighted-Average Diluted Shares Outstanding. Non-GAAP Weighted-Average Diluted Shares Outstanding is\ndefined by the company as GAAP Weighted-Average Diluted Shares Outstanding, adjusted to include any common\nshares issuable under the company’s equity plans and convertible debt in periods when they are dilutive under Non-\nGAAP. The company’s presentation of percentage changes in total revenues at Constant Currency rates, which is\ncomputed using current period local currency sales at the prior period’s foreign exchange rates, is also a Non-GAAP\nfinancial measure. This measure provides information about growth (or declines) in the company’s total revenue as if\nforeign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior period and the current period.\nBioMarin regularly uses both GAAP and Non-GAAP results and expectations internally to assess its financial\noperating performance and evaluate key business decisions related to its principal business activities: the discovery,\ndevelopment, manufacture, marketing and sale of innovative biologic therapies. Because Non-GAAP Income, Non-\nGAAP Operating Margin percentage, Non-GAAP Diluted EPS, Non-GAAP Weighted-Average Diluted Shares\nOutstanding and Constant Currency are important internal measurements for BioMarin, the company believes that\nproviding this information in conjunction with BioMarin’s GAAP information enhances investors’ and analysts’ ability to\nmeaningfully compare the company’s results from period to period and to its forward-looking guidance, and to identify\noperating trends in the company’s principal business. BioMarin also uses Non-GAAP Income internally to understand,\nmanage and evaluate its business and to make operating decisions, and compensation of executives is based in part\non this measure.\nNon-GAAP Income and its components are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior\nto comparable GAAP measures and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial information\nprepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors should note that the Non-GAAP information is not prepared under any\ncomprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and does not reflect all of the amounts associated with the\ncompany’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors should also note that these Non-\nGAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their\nusefulness to investors. In addition, from time to time in the future there may be other items that the company may\nexclude for purposes of its Non-GAAP financial measures; likewise, the company may in the future cease to exclude\nitems that it has historically excluded for purposes of its Non-GAAP financial measures. Because of the non-\nstandardized definitions, the Non-GAAP financial measure as used by BioMarin in this press release and the\naccompanying tables may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly\ntitled measures used by other companies.\nThe following tables present the reconciliation of GAAP reported to Non-GAAP adjusted financial information:\n10\nReconciliation of GAAP Reported Net Income to Non-GAAP Income (1)\n(In millions of U.S. dollars)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nGAAP Reported Net Income $ 106 $ 40 $ 302 $ 147\nAdjustments\nStock-based compensation expense - COS 5 4 12 13\nStock-based compensation expense - R&D 11 14 45 49\nStock-based compensation expense - SG&A 27 30 93 90\nAmortization of intangible assets 5 16 34 47\nGain on sale of nonfinancial assets (2) — — (10) —\nSeverance and restructuring costs (3) 44 (1) 86 (1)\nLoss on investments (4) — — 5 13\nIncome tax effect of adjustments (20) (16) (61) (48)\nNon-GAAP Income $ 178 $ 89 $ 506 $ 310\nReconciliation of Certain GAAP Reported Information to Non-GAAP Information(1)\n(in millions of U.S. dollars, except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2024\nDollar Percentage Dollar Percentage\nGAAP Change in Total Revenues $ 165 28 % $ 334 19 %\nAdjustment for unfavorable impact of foreign currency\nexchange rates on product sales denominated in currencies\n23 75\nother than U.S. dollars\nNon-GAAP change in Total Revenues at Constant Currency $ 188 32 % $ 409 23 %\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nPercent Percent Percent Percent\nof GAAP of GAAP of GAAP of GAAP\nTotal Total Total Total\n2024 Revenue 2023 Revenue 2024 Revenue 2023 Revenue\nGAAP Income from Operations $ 114 15.3 % $ 31 5.3 % $ 323 15.3 % $ 158 8.9 %\nAdjustments\nStock-based compensation\nexpense 43 5.7 48 8.3 150 7.2 152 8.6\nAmortization of intangible assets 5 0.7 16 2.8 34 1.6 47 2.7\nGain on sale of nonfinancial\nassets (2) — — — — (10) (0.5) — —\nSeverance and restructuring\ncosts (3) 45 6.0 (1) (0.2) 87 4.1 (1) (0.1)\nNon-GAAP Income from Operations $ 207 27.7 % $ 94 16.2 % $ 583 27.7 % $ 357 20.1 %\n11\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nGAAP Diluted EPS $ 0.55 $ 0.21 $ 1.56 $ 0.77\nAdjustments\nStock-based compensation expense 0.22 0.24 0.76 0.76\nAmortization of intangible assets 0.03 0.08 0.17 0.24\nGain on sale of nonfinancial assets (2) — — (0.05) —\nSeverance and restructuring costs (3) 0.22 — 0.44 —\nLoss on investments (4) — — 0.03 0.06\nIncome tax effect of adjustments (0.11) (0.07) (0.31) (0.23)\nNon-GAAP Diluted EPS $ 0.91 $ 0.46 $ 2.60 $ 1.60\n(1) Certain amounts may not sum or recalculate due to rounding.\n(2) Represents a payment triggered by a third party's attainment of a regulatory approval milestone related to previously sold intangible\nassets.\n(3) These amounts were included in SG&A and represent severance and restructuring costs related to the company's 2024 portfolio\nstrategy review and the associated organizational redesign efforts announced in the second and third quarters of 2024.

(BioMarin), including, without limitation, statements about: future financial performance, including the\nexpectations of Total Revenues, Non-GAAP Operating Margin percentage, and Non-GAAP Diluted EPS for the full-year 2024 and the underlying\ndrivers of those results, such as the revenue opportunity represented by treatments for skeletal conditions, as well as the expectations relating to\noperating cash flow per year starting in 2027 and BioMarin’s compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for total revenues through 2034; BioMarin’s\nnew corporate strategy and belief that such strategy will build on BioMarin’s legacy of innovation to deliver even greater value to the patients it\nserves around the world and position BioMarin for significant growth; BioMarin’s commitment to expand profitability while investing in innovation;\nBioMarin’s ability to accelerate the VOXZOGO opportunity; the continued growth potential of BioMarin’s Enzyme Therapies portfolio; the anticipated\nbenefits from its organizational redesign efforts; BioMarin’s updated strategy for ROCTAVIAN and its anticipated benefits; the timing of orders for\ncommercial products; BioMarin’s ability to meet product demand; the timing of BioMarin’s clinical development and commercial prospects, including\nannouncements of data from clinical studies and trials; the clinical development and commercialization of BioMarin’s product candidates and\ncommercial products, including (i) the potential to leverage VOXZOGO in conditions beyond achondroplasia, such as hypochondroplasia, idiopathic\nshort stature, Noonan syndrome, Turner syndrome, SHOX deficiency and other genetic short stature pathway conditions, (ii) the expected\ncompletion of enrollment for the pivotal study of VOXZOGO in hypochondroplasia in the first half of 2025, (iii) the expected expansion of VOXZOGO\nin the U.S. and BioMarin’s ability to enable VOXZOGO access into more than 20 additional countries by 2027, (iv) BioMarin’s expectation to initiate\nthe first-in-human study for BMN 333 in early 2025, (v) BioMarin’s expectation to receive initial proof-of-concept data regarding BMN 351 in 2025,\n(vi) BioMarin’s expectation to start dosing the multiple-ascending dose phase of the study for BMN 349 by the end of the year, (vii) BioMarin’s\nexpectation to receive data from the phase 3 study with PALYNZIQ in adolescents ages 12-17 in 2025 to support a potential U.S. Supplemental\nBiologics License Application in the second half of the year, (viii) BioMarin’s expectations to submit an IND for BMN 390 in the second half of 2025,\nand (ix) BioMarin’s expectation to potentially submit an IND for BMN 370 during the second half of 2025; the expected benefits and availability of\nBioMarin’s commercial products and product candidates; and potential growth opportunities and trends, including BioMarin’s plans to drive growth\nof its Enzyme Therapies across the 80 countries in which they are available. These forward-looking statements are predictions and involve risks and\nuncertainties such that actual results may differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, among others, those\nfactors detailed in BioMarin’s press release issued October 29, 2024 and BioMarin's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,\nincluding, without limitation, the factors contained under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in BioMarin’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023 as such factors may be updated by any subsequent reports including BioMarin’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the\nquarter ended June 30, 2024. You are urged not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.\nBioMarin is under no obligation, and expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new\ninformation, future events or otherwise.\n33\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis presentation includes both GAAP information and Non-GAAP information. Non-GAAP Income is defined by the company as GAAP Net Income\nexcluding amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, and, in certain periods, certain other specified items, as detailed\nbelow when applicable. The company also includes a Non-GAAP adjustment for the estimated tax impact of the reconciling items. Non-GAAP\nOperating Margin percentage is defined by the company as GAAP Income from Operations, excluding amortization of intangible assets, stock-\nbased compensation expense, and, in certain periods, certain other specified items, divided by GAAP Total Revenues. Non-GAAP Diluted EPS is\ndefined by the company as Non-GAAP Income divided by Non-GAAP Weighted-Average Diluted Shares Outstanding. Non-GAAP Weighted-\nAverage Diluted Shares Outstanding is defined by the company as GAAP Weighted-Average Diluted Shares Outstanding, adjusted to include any\ncommon shares issuable under the company’s equity plans and convertible debt in periods when they are dilutive under Non-GAAP.\nBioMarin regularly uses both GAAP and Non-GAAP results and expectations internally to assess its financial operating performance and evaluate\nkey business decisions related to its principal business activities: the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing and sale of innovative\nbiologic therapies. Because Non-GAAP Income, Non-GAAP Operating Margin percentage, Non-GAAP Diluted EPS, and Non-GAAP Weighted-\nAverage Diluted Shares Outstanding are important internal measurements for BioMarin, the company believes that providing this information in\nconjunction with BioMarin’s GAAP information enhances investors’ and analysts’ ability to meaningfully compare the company’s results from period\nto period and to its forward-looking guidance, and to identify operating trends in the company’s principal business. BioMarin also uses Non-GAAP\nIncome internally to understand, manage and evaluate its business and to make operating decisions, and compensation of executives is based in\npart on this measure.\nNon-GAAP Income and its components are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, comparable GAAP\nmeasures and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors should note\nthat the Non-GAAP information is not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and does not reflect all of the\namounts associated with the company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Investors should also note that these Non-\nGAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. In\naddition, from time to time in the future there may be other items that the company may exclude for purposes of its Non-GAAP financial measures;\nlikewise, the company may in the future cease to exclude items that it has historically excluded for purposes of its Non-GAAP financial measures.\nBecause of the non-standardized definitions, the Non-GAAP financial measure as used by BioMarin in this presentation may be calculated\ndifferently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n44\nDuring Q3’24, BioMarin\nexecuted on its new\n$746M\ncorporate strategy,\n+28%\ndelivering strong\nTotal\nrevenue growth and\nRevenues Enzyme Therapies(1)\nQ3’24 VOXZOGO\nprofitability expansion;\nOther\nfull year guidance\nraised at mid-point\n$190M $509M 27.7% $0.91\n+54% +27% +11.5 ppts +98%\nVOXZOGO Enzyme Non-GAAP Non-GAAP Diluted\nRevenues Therapies Operating Earnings per\nRevenues Margin(2) Share(2)\nAll figures represent thethirdquarter 2024;

gains and losses on investments; and other unusual gains and losses without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a\nmaterial impact on GAAP reported results for the guidance period.

BioMarin does not provide guidance for GAAP reported financial measures (other than revenue) or a reconciliation of\nforward-looking Non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP reported financial measures because the companyis unable to predict with reasonable certainty the financial impact of changes\nresulting from its strategic portfolio and business operating model reviews; potential future asset impairments; gains and losses on investments; and other unusual gains and losses without unreasonable effort.

Discussion of the risks listed below, and other risks that we face, are discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\n• If we fail to obtain and maintain an adequate level of coverage and reimbursement for our products by third-party payers, the sales of our\nproducts would be adversely affected or there may be no commercially viable markets for our products.\n• As compared to our other, more traditional products, gene therapy products may present additional challenges with respect to the pricing,\ncoverage, reimbursement, and acceptance of the product.\n• Because the target patient populations for our products are relatively small, we must achieve significant market share and maintain high per-\npatient prices for our products to achieve and maintain profitability.\n• If we fail to compete successfully with respect to product sales, we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to recover our expenses\nrelated to the development of a product program or to justify continued marketing of a product and our revenues could be adversely\naffected.\n• Changes in methods of treatment of disease could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect revenues.\n• If we fail to develop new products and product candidates or compete successfully with respect to acquisitions, joint ventures, licenses or\nother collaboration opportunities, our ability to continue to expand our product pipeline and our growth and development would be impaired.\n• The sale of generic versions of KUVAN by generic manufacturers has adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our revenues\nand may cause a decline in KUVAN revenues faster than expected.\n• If we do not achieve our projected development goals in the timeframes we announce or fail to achieve such goals, the commercialization of\nour product candidates may be delayed or never occur and the credibility of our management may be adversely affected and, as a result,\nour stock price may decline.\nTable of Contents\nRegulatory Risks\n• If we fail to obtain regulatory approval to commercially market and sell our product candidates, or if approval of our product candidates is\ndelayed, we will be unable to generate revenues from the sale of these product candidates, our potential for generating positive cash flow\nwill be diminished, and the capital necessary to fund our operations will increase.\n• Any product for which we have obtained regulatory approval, or for which we obtain approval in the future, is subject to, or will be subject to,\nextensive ongoing regulatory requirements by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Commission (EC), the European\nMedicines Agency (EMA) and other comparable international regulatory authorities, and if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if\nwe experience unanticipated problems with our products, we may be subject to penalties, we will be unable to generate revenues from the\nsale of such products, our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished, and the capital necessary to fund our operations will\nbe increased.\n• To obtain regulatory approval to market our products, preclinical studies and costly and lengthy clinical trials are required and the results of\nthe studies and trials are highly uncertain. Likewise, preliminary, initial or interim data from clinical trials should be considered carefully and\nwith caution because the final data may be materially different from the preliminary, initial or interim data, particularly as more patient data\nbecome available.\n• Government price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our current and\nfuture products, which would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\n• Government healthcare reform could increase our costs and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nFinancial and Financing Risks\n• If we incur operating losses or are unable to sustain positive cash flows for a period longer than anticipated, we may be unable to continue\nour operations at planned levels and may be forced to reduce our operations.\nManufacturing Risks\n• If we fail to comply with manufacturing regulations, our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected.\n• If we are unable to successfully develop and maintain manufacturing processes for our product candidates to produce sufficient quantities at\nacceptable costs, we may be unable to support a clinical trial or be forced to terminate a program, or if we are unable to produce sufficient\nquantities of our products at acceptable costs, we may be unable to meet commercial demand, lose potential revenue, have reduced\nmargins or be forced to terminate a program.\n• Supply interruptions may disrupt our inventory levels and the availability of our products and product candidates and cause delays in\nobtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, or harm our business by reducing our revenues.\nRisks Related to International Operations\n• We conduct a significant amount of our operations and generate a significant percentage of our sales outside of the U.S., which subjects us\nto additional business risks that could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\n• A significant portion of our international sales are made based on special access programs, and changes to these programs could adversely\naffect our product sales and revenues in these countries.\n• Our international operations pose currency risks, which may adversely affect our operating results and net income.\nIntellectual Property Risks\n• If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may not be able to compete effectively or preserve our market shares.\n• Competitors and other third parties may have developed intellectual property that could limit our ability to market and commercialize our\nproducts and product candidates, if approved.\nTable of Contents\nBIOMARIN PHARMACEUTICAL INC.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage\nPART I.

disclosed)\n(1) BUSINESS OVERVIEW AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nNature of Operations\nBioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (the Company or BioMarin) is a global biotechnology company dedicated to translating the promise of genetic discovery\ninto medicines that make a profound impact on the life of each patient. The San Rafael, California-based company, founded in 1997, has a proven track record\nof innovation with eight commercial therapies and a strong clinical and preclinical pipeline. Using a distinctive approach to drug discovery and development,\nBioMarin pursues treatments that offer new possibilities for patients and families around the world navigating rare or difficult to treat genetic conditions.\nBasis of Presentation\nThese Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and\nthe rules and regulations of the SEC for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. GAAP\nfor complete financial statements, although management believes that the disclosures herein are adequate to ensure that the information presented is not\nmisleading. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes\nthereto for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The results of\noperations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2024 or any other period.\nChange in Presentation\nEffective January 1, 2024, the Company changed its presentation for foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from remeasurement and\nidle plant costs within its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Effective with this change in presentation, foreign currency transaction\ngains and losses resulting from remeasurement are presented in Other Income (Expense), Net and idle plant costs are presented in Cost of Sales. Prior to this\nchange in presentation, both foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from remeasurement and idle plant costs were presented in Selling, General\nand Administrative (SG&A) expense. The Company believes that this change in presentation is preferable because the revised presentation is more consistent\nwith how management measures the Company’s operating performance.\nPrior period amounts were revised to conform to current period presentation. The following table reflects the impacts of the change in presentation for\nthe prior periods presented. The change in presentation had no impact to Net Income, Total Stockholders’ Equity or earnings per share for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.\nThree Months ended September 30, 2023 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nPreviously As Reported (after Previously As Reported (after\nReported Adjustments adjustments) Reported Adjustments adjustments)\nCost of sales $ 124,745 $ 3,296 $ 128,041 $ 379,376 $ 14,756 $ 394,132\nSG&A $ 223,928 $ (8,160) $ 215,768 $ 662,267 $ (29,373) $ 632,894\nTotal operating expenses $ 555,668 $ (4,864) $ 550,804 $ 1,629,141 $ (14,617) $ 1,614,524\nOther income (expense), net $ 4,047 $ (4,864) $ (817) $ (3,700) $ (14,617) $ (18,317)\nUse of Estimates\nU.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that the\nCompany may undertake in the future, actual results may be different from those estimates. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all\nadjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of results for these interim periods.\nManagement performed an evaluation of the Company’s activities through the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to determine if there\nwere any subsequent events that occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date and prior to filing this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, that would require\nrecognition or disclosure in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n7\nTable of Contents\nBIOMARIN PHARMACEUTICAL INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThere have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as\ncompared to the significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 – Business Overview and Significant Accounting Policies to the Company’s Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThere have been no new accounting pronouncements adopted by the Company or new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board (FASB) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the recent accounting pronouncements described in\nNote 1 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, that the\nCompany believes are of significance or potential significance to the Company. The following paragraphs discuss new accounting pronouncements issued by the\nFASB, but not yet adopted by the Company.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, Segment Reporting Topic 280, Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures, to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07\nexpands public entities’ segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision\nmaker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items and interim\ndisclosures of a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets. The effective date for the update is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and\ninterim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and should be applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented.

In addition, the\nCompany sells its products in countries that face economic volatility and weakness. Although the Company has historically collected receivables from customers\nin certain countries, sustained weakness or further deterioration of the local economies and currencies may cause customers in those countries to delay\npayment or be unable to pay for the Company’s products.

Compensation expense included in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for all stock-based compensation\narrangements was as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCost of sales $ 5,092 $ 4,042 $ 12,110 $ 13,094\nResearch and development 11,496 14,490 45,108 49,373\nSelling, general and administrative 26,901 29,855 92,434 89,777\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 43,489 $ 48,387 $ 149,652 $ 152,244\n(10) RESTRUCTURING\nDuring 2024, in connection with the discontinuation of certain research and development programs and organizational redesign efforts centered around\nthe Company’s strategic priorities, including the acceleration and maximization of VOXZOGO, establishing the ROCTAVIAN opportunity, and focusing R&D\nactivities on the assets that management believes will be the most productive and accelerate earnings per share through expanding margins, the Company\ncommitted to plans in the second and third quarters of 2024, to reduce its global workforce by approximately 170 and 225 employees, respectively. These\nworkforce reductions are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2024.\nThe restructuring plan includes severance and employee-related costs, asset impairments, and other costs. The asset impairment charges were for\nabandoned assets-in-progress and a Right-of-Use asset (ROU Asset) related to leased office space the Company decided to exit and sub-lease. The Company\nutilized the discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of the ROU Asset. The ROU Asset impairment is the difference between the existing lease\nterms and rates and the expected sub-lease terms and rates available in the market. The Other category includes restructuring-related costs, which are\nexpensed as incurred, as well as other obligations related to the leased office space that will be satisfied over the remainder of the lease term.\n16\nTable of Contents\nBIOMARIN PHARMACEUTICAL INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (continued)\n(In thousands of U.S. Dollars, except per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)\nThe restructuring charges and adjustments were included in Selling, General, and Administrative in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nComprehensive Income.

The Company’s 2024 Notes\nmatured in August 2024 and substantially all holders were repaid in cash. For additional discussion of the Company’s convertible debt, see Note 6 -\nDebt.\n(12) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nContingencies\nFrom time to time the Company is involved in legal actions arising in the normal course of its business. The process of resolving matters through\nlitigation or other means is inherently uncertain and it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of these matters could adversely affect the Company, its results\nof operations, financial condition or cash flows. The Company’s general practice is to expense legal fees as services are rendered in connection with legal\nmatters, and to accrue for liabilities when losses are probable and reasonably estimable based on existing information. The Company accrues for the best\nestimate of a loss within a range; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, then the minimum amount in the range is accrued. Liabilities are\nevaluated and refined each reporting period as additional information is known. Any receivables for insurance recoveries for these liability claims are recorded as\nassets when it is probable that a recovery will be realized.\nAs previously disclosed, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting that the Company produce certain\ndocuments regarding sponsored testing programs relating to VIMIZIM and NAGLAZYME. The Company has produced the requested documents in response to\nthe subpoena and is cooperating fully. The Company is unable to make any assurances regarding the outcome of the investigation by the DOJ, or the impact, if\nany, that such investigation may have on the Company’s business, Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nComprehensive Income or Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nContingent Payments\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company was subject to contingent payments, primarily comprised of development, regulatory and commercial\nmilestones. Those considered reasonably possible totaled $196.1 million, of this amount the Company may pay up to $4.1 million over the next 12 months if\ncertain contingencies are met.\nOther Commitments\nThe Company uses experts and laboratories at universities and other institutions to perform certain R&D activities. These amounts are recorded as\nR&D expense as services are provided. In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various firm purchase commitments primarily to procure\nactive pharmaceutical ingredients, certain inventory-related items and certain third-party R&D services, production services and facility construction services.\nThe Company also has commitments related to enterprise resource planning (ERP) system implementation costs for which the Company is committed. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, such commitments were estimated at $474.1 million, of which $269.8 million is expected to be paid in 2024 as underlying goods and\nservices are received. The Company has also licensed technology from third parties, for which it is required to pay royalties upon future sales, subject to certain\nannual minimums.\n18\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements and the related Notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks\nand uncertainties. When reviewing the discussion below, you should keep in mind the substantial risks and uncertainties that could impact our business. In\nparticular, we encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties described in “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These\nrisks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ significantly from those projected in forward-looking statements contained in this report or implied by\npast results and trends. Forward-looking statements are statements that attempt to forecast or anticipate future developments in our business, financial condition\nor results of operations. See the section titled “Forward-Looking Statements” that appears at the beginning of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These\nstatements, like all statements in this report, speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (unless another date is indicated), and, except as\nrequired by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements in light of future developments. Our Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements have been prepared in accordance with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and are presented in U.S.\nDollars (USD).\n19\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\n(In millions, except as otherwise disclosed)\nOverview\nWe are a global biotechnology company dedicated to translating the promise of genetic discovery into medicines that make a profound impact on the\nlife of each patient. Our San Rafael, California-based company, founded in 1997, has a proven track record of innovation with eight commercial therapies and a\nstrong clinical and preclinical pipeline. Using a distinctive approach to drug discovery and development, we pursue treatments that offer new possibilities for\npatients and families around the world navigating rare or difficult to treat genetic conditions.\nA summary of our commercial products, as of September 30, 2024, is provided below:\nCommercial Products Indication\nVOXZOGO (vosoritide) Achondroplasia\nVIMIZIM (elosulfase alpha) Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) IVA\nNAGLAZYME (galsulfase) MPS VI\nPALYNZIQ (pegvaliase-pqpz) Phenylketonuria (PKU)\nALDURAZYME (laronidase) MPS I\nBRINEURA (cerliponase alfa) Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2)\nKUVAN (sapropterin dihydrochloride) PKU\nROCTAVIAN (valoctocogene roxaparvovec) Severe Hemophilia A\nFinancial Highlights\nKey components of our results of operations include the following:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nTotal revenues $ 745.7 $ 581.3 $ 2,106.6 $ 1,773.0\nCost of sales $ 188.5 $ 128.0 $ 444.1 $ 394.1\nResearch and development (R&D) $ 184.9 $ 191.3 $ 573.7 $ 540.5\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) $ 253.5 $ 215.8 $ 742.4 $ 632.9\nNet income $ 106.1 $ 40.4 $ 301.9 $ 147.3\nSee “Results of Operations” below for discussion of our results for the periods presented.\nUncertainty Relating to Macroeconomic Environment\nConditions in the current macroeconomic environment, such as inflation, changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates, natural disasters,\ngeopolitical instability, and supply chain disruptions, could impact our global revenue sources and our overall business operations. The extent and duration of\nsuch effects remain uncertain and difficult to predict. We are actively monitoring and managing our response and assessing actual and potential impacts to our\noperating results and financial condition, as well as developments in our business, which could further impact the developments, trends and expectations\ndescribed below. See the risk factor, “Our business is affected by macroeconomic conditions.” described in “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q.\nRecent Developments\nWe continued to grow our commercial business and advance our product candidate pipeline during 2024. We believe that the combination of our\ninternal research programs and partnerships will allow us to continue to develop and commercialize innovative therapies for patients with serious and life-\nthreatening rare diseases and medical conditions.\nIn 2024, we focused on value creation through working to accelerate growth, optimize efficiencies and drive operational excellence, including progress\nin executing on the key strategic priorities of accelerating and maximizing VOXZOGO, establishing the ROCTAVIAN opportunity, and focusing R&D activities on\nthe assets management believes will be the most productive and\n20\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\n(In millions, except as otherwise disclosed)\naccelerate earnings per share through expanding margins. We also completed a strategic portfolio assessment of R&D programs to determine which we believe\nhave the strongest combination of scientific merit, opportunity for commercial success and potential value creation for stockholders. We determined that BMN\n333, a long-acting C-type natriuretic peptide for multiple growth disorders, BMN 349, a potential best-in-class, oral therapeutic for liver disease associated with\nAlpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, and BMN 351, our next generation oligonucleotide for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, all met criteria for advancement. Based on\nsuch strategic portfolio assessment, certain programs have also been discontinued. In connection with the strategic portfolio assessment and organizational\nredesign efforts, we have committed to plans in the second and third quarters of 2024 to reduce our global workforce by an aggregate of approximately 395\nemployees. Further, we initiated the execution of our financial and operational strategy that improved operating results and is expected to continue to improve\nour results of operations going forward. In August 2024, we announced our ROCTAVIAN strategy, which includes focusing on the U.S., Germany, and Italy,\nwhere ROCTAVIAN is approved and reimbursed, and reducing additional investments in development and manufacturing, that we anticipate will enable\nROCTAVIAN to contribute to our long-term profitability. See the risk factor, “Our success depends on our ability to manage our growth.” described in “Risk\nFactors” in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nChange in Presentation\nOn January 1, 2024, we changed our presentation of foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from remeasurement and idle plant costs\nwithin our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. See Note 1 to our accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional details.\nResults of Operations\nNet Product Revenues\nNet Product Revenues consisted of the following:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nVOXZOGO $ 189.9 $ 123.1 $ 66.8 $ 526.6 $ 324.2 $ 202.4\nVIMIZIM 178.2 158.9 19.3 548.7 525.6 23.1\nNAGLAZYME 131.9 108.9 23.0 369.6 322.0 47.6\nPALYNZIQ 90.6 78.9 11.7 254.6 216.1 38.5\nALDURAZYME 71.0 13.8 57.2 144.8 88.5 56.3\nBRINEURA 37.0 41.0 (4.0) 121.4 118.2 3.2\nKUVAN 28.1 42.9 (14.8) 92.6 144.0 (51.4)\nROCTAVIAN 7.2 0.8 6.4 15.5 0.8 14.7\nTotal net product revenues $ 733.9 $ 568.3 $ 165.6 $ 2,073.8 $ 1,739.4 $ 334.4\nNet Product Revenues include revenues generated from our commercial products. In the U.S., our commercial products, except for PALYNZIQ and\nALDURAZYME, are generally sold to specialty pharmacies or end users, such as hospitals, which act as retailers. PALYNZIQ is distributed in the U.S. through\ncertain certified specialty pharmacies under the PALYNZIQ Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program, and ALDURAZYME is marketed worldwide by\nSanofi. Outside the U.S., our commercial products are sold to authorized distributors or directly to government purchasers or hospitals, which act as the end\nusers.\nThe increase in Net Product Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023\nwas primarily attributed to the following:\n• VOXZOGO: higher sales volume from new patients initiating therapy across all regions;\n• ALDURAZYME: higher sales volume due to timing of order fulfillment to Sanofi as we recognize ALDURAZYME revenues when the product is\nreleased and control is transferred to Sanofi;\n• NAGLAZYME: higher sales volume due to timing of orders in countries that place large government orders, particularly in the Middle East;\n• VIMIZIM: higher sales volume due to timing of orders in countries that place large government orders, particularly in Latin America and the\nMiddle East; and\n21\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\n(In millions of U.S. dollars, except as otherwise disclosed)\n• PALYNZIQ: higher sales volume due to new patients initiating therapy, primarily in the U.S.\nThese increases were partially offset by the following:\n• KUVAN: lower product revenues attributed to increasing generic competition as a result of the loss of market exclusivity.\nThe increase in Net Product Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was\nprimarily attributed to the following:\n• VOXZOGO: higher sales volume from new patients initiating therapy across all regions;\n• ALDURAZYME: higher sales volume due to timing of order fulfillment to Sanofi as we recognize ALDURAZYME revenues when the product is\nreleased and control is transferred to Sanofi:\n• NAGLAZYME: higher sales volume due to timing of orders in countries that place large government orders, particularly in the Middle East.\n• PALYNZIQ: higher sales volume from new patients initiating therapy, primarily in the U.S.; and\n• VIMIZIM: higher sales volume due to new patients initiating therapy in the U.S. and timing of orders in countries that place large government\norders, particularly in Latin America.\nThese increases were partially offset by the following:\n• KUVAN: lower product revenues attributed to increasing generic competition as a result of the loss of market exclusivity.\nIn certain countries, governments place large periodic orders for our products. We expect that the timing of these large government orders will continue\nto be inconsistent, which has created in the past and may continue to create significant period to period variation in our revenues.\nWith respect to KUVAN, see also the risk factor “The sale of generic versions of KUVAN by generic manufacturers has adversely affected and will\ncontinue to adversely affect our revenues and may cause a decline in KUVAN revenues faster than expected” in “Risk Factors” included in Part II, Item 1A of this\nQuarterly Report for additional information on risks we face.\nStrong demand for VOXZOGO in certain markets had outpaced our projections in recent quarters and we anticipated challenges meeting our estimated\nVOXZOGO demand during the first half of 2024. We have recently increased fill-finish capacity to meet this demand and continue to implement actions to\nmanage growth and minimize patient impact. While supply constraints have eased in the second quarter of 2024 and we expect to have the ability to meet\nestimated demand and support ongoing clinical programs, if actual demand continues to exceed estimates, the supply constraint could be prolonged. We do not\nexpect a material impact on our revenues if we successfully execute our manufacturing plans. See \"Risk Factors\" in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report for\nadditional information on risk factors that could impact our business and operations.\nWe face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, which we expect to continue in future periods. We use foreign currency exchange\nforward contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure, primarily the Euro. Certain currencies are not included in our hedging program, such\nas the Argentine Peso. With respect to the risks posed by fluctuations of both hedged and unhedged currencies against the U.S. dollar, see the risk factor “Our\ninternational operations pose currency risks, which may adversely affect our operating results and net income” in “Risk Factors” included in Part II, Item 1A of\nthis\n22\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\n(In millions of U.S. dollars, except as otherwise disclosed)\nQuarterly Report for additional information. The following table shows our Net Product Revenues denominated in USD and foreign currencies:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nSales denominated in USD $ 378.9 $ 257.9 $ 121.0 $ 1,017.5 $ 830.6 $ 186.9\nSales denominated in foreign currencies 355.0 310.4 44.6 1,056.3 908.8 147.5\nTotal net product revenues $ 733.9 $ 568.3 $ 165.6 $ 2,073.8 $ 1,739.4 $ 334.4\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nUnfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on\nproduct sales denominated in currencies other than USD $ (22.6) $ (21.8) $ (0.8) $ (75.2) $ (71.9) $ (3.3)\nThe unfavorable impact for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was relatively\nflat. The unfavorable impact for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by the\nweakening of the Argentine Peso, Japanese Yen and Brazilian Real, partially offset by strengthening of the Euro.\nRoyalty and Other Revenues\nRoyalty and Other Revenues include royalties earned on net sales of products sold by third parties, up-front licensing fees and milestones achieved by\nlicensees or sublicensees.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nRoyalty and other revenues $ 11.9 $ 13.1 $ (1.2) $ 32.8 $ 33.6 $ (0.8)\nThe change in Royalty and Other Revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023 was relatively flat. We expect to continue to earn royalties from third parties in the future.\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nCost of Sales includes raw materials, personnel and facility and other costs associated with manufacturing our commercial products. These costs\ninclude production materials, production costs at our manufacturing facilities, third-party manufacturing costs, amortization of technology transfer intangible\nassets and internal and external final formulation and packaging costs. Cost of Sales also includes royalties payable to third parties based on sales of our\nproducts, idle plant costs and charges for inventory valuation reserves.\nThe following table summarizes our Cost of Sales and gross margin:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nTotal revenues $ 745.7 $ 581.3 $ 164.4 $ 2,106.6 $ 1,773.0 $ 333.6\nCost of sales $ 188.5 $ 128.0 $ 60.5 $ 444.1 $ 394.1 $ 50.0\nGross margin 74.7 % 78.0 % (3.3)% 78.9 % 77.8 % 1.1 %\nCost of Sales increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2023, primarily from higher sales volumes and increased ROCTAVIAN inventory reserves, partially\n23\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\n(In millions of U.S. dollars, except as otherwise disclosed)\noffset by lower per-unit manufacturing costs. Gross margin decreased in the current three-month period due to higher sales volumes for products with lower\nmargin, driven by ALDURAZYME sales volume and ROCTAVIAN inventory reserves. Gross margin increased in the current nine-month period due to higher\nsales volumes for products with higher margin, driven by VOXZOGO sales volume.\nWe expect gross margin to increase modestly as our product mix is expected to shift, with increasing sales volumes for our higher margin commercial\nproducts.\nResearch and Development\nR&D expense includes costs associated with the research and development of product candidates and post-marketing research commitments related\nto our commercial products. R&D expense primarily includes preclinical and clinical studies, personnel and raw materials costs associated with manufacturing\nclinical product, quality control and assurance, other R&D activities, R&D facilities and regulatory costs.\nWe group all of our R&D activities and related expense into three categories: (i) research and early pipeline, (ii) later-stage clinical programs and (iii)\nmarketed products as follows:\nCategory Description\nR&D expense incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 2 clinical\nResearch and early pipeline\ntrials, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism and process development.\nR&D expense incurred in or related to phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a\nLater-stage clinical programs\nnew indication for an existing product primarily in the U.S. or the EU.\nR&D expense incurred in support of our marketed products that are authorized to be sold primarily in the U.S. or the EU.\nIncludes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory\nMarketed products\nauthorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining\nregulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the U.S. or EU has been obtained.\nWe manage our R&D expense by identifying the R&D activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based\non scientific data, probability of successful development, market potential, available human and capital resources and other similar considerations. We\ncontinually review our product pipeline and the development status of product candidates and, as necessary, reallocate resources among the research and\ndevelopment portfolio that we believe will best support the future growth of our business.\nR&D consisted of the following:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nResearch and early pipeline $ 104.9 $ 103.9 $ 1.0 $ 331.4 $ 280.4 $ 51.0\nLater-stage clinical programs 10.1 — 10.1 17.8 30.7 (12.9)\nMarketed Products 69.9 87.4 (17.5) 224.5 229.4 (4.9)\nTotal R&D $ 184.9 $ 191.3 $ (6.4) $ 573.7 $ 540.5 $ 33.2\nThe decrease in R&D expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was\nprimarily due to the following:\n• Marketed products: lower spend on ROCTAVIAN as we shift resources to the new VOXZOGO indications and our prioritized pipeline.\nThe decrease was partially offset by the following:\n• Later-stage clinical programs: higher spend on clinical activities related to VOXZOGO for the treatment of hypochondroplasia.\nThe increase in R&D expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was\nprimarily due to the following:\n24\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\n(In millions of U.S. dollars, except as otherwise disclosed)\n• Research and early pipeline: higher spend related to pre-clinical activities for new VOXZOGO indications and our prioritized pipeline.\nThis increase was partially offset by the following:\n• Later-stage clinical programs: lower spend on ROCTAVIAN, which was moved to Marketed products following Food and Drug Administration\napproval in the second quarter of 2023, partially offset by higher spend on the new VOXZOGO indication for hypochondroplasia.\nWe expect R&D expense to increase in future periods, primarily due to increased spending for the new VOXZOGO indications and research and early\npipeline programs.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSales and marketing (S&M) expense primarily consisted of employee-related expenses for our sales group, brand marketing, patient support groups\nand pre-commercialization expenses related to our product candidates. General and administrative (G&A) expense primarily consisted of corporate support and\nother administrative expenses, including employee-related expenses.\nSG&A consisted of the following:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nS&M $ 108.9 $ 121.9 $ (13.0) $ 351.1 $ 355.2 $ (4.1)\nG&A 144.6 93.9 50.7 391.3 277.7 113.6\nTotal SG&A $ 253.5 $ 215.8 $ 37.7 $ 742.4 $ 632.9 $ 109.5\nS&M consisted of the following:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nEnzyme Products $ 52.2 $ 54.9 $ (2.7) $ 163.8 $ 167.6 $ (3.8)\nVOXZOGO 28.0 27.4 0.6 90.4 78.4 12.0\nROCTAVIAN 17.0 27.2 (10.2) 65.0 74.6 (9.6)\nOther 11.7 12.4 (0.7) 31.9 34.6 (2.7)\nTotal S&M $ 108.9 $ 121.9 $ (13.0) $ 351.1 $ 355.2 $ (4.1)\nThe decrease in S&M expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 was primarily attributed to reduced activities related to ROCTAVIAN as we focused commercial efforts in the U.S., Germany and Italy to\nalign with our updated ROCTAVIAN strategy.\nThe increase in G&A expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 was primarily due to severance and restructuring costs associated with our portfolio strategy review and the associated organizational\nredesign efforts announced in 2024. The increase in G&A expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 also included incremental administrative costs, including consulting and legal fees.\nWe expect SG&A expense to remain relatively consistent in future periods as continued market expansion of our commercial products is partially offset\nby the benefits of our ongoing corporate initiatives.\n25\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\n(In millions of U.S. dollars, except as otherwise disclosed)\nIntangible Asset Amortization and Gain on Sale of Nonfinancial Assets\nIntangible Asset Amortization and Gain on Sale of Nonfinancial Assets were as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nAmortization of intangible assets $ 5.0 $ 15.7 $ (10.7) $ 33.6 $ 47.0 $ (13.4)\nGain on sale of nonfinancial assets $ — $ — $ — $ 10.0 $ — $ 10.0\nAmortization of intangible assets – the decrease in expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to the increase in the estimated useful life of an intangible asset and an intangible asset becoming fully\namortized during the fourth quarter of 2023.\nGain on Sale of Nonfinancial Assets – in the first quarter of 2024, we recognized a gain of $10.0 million due to a third party’s achievement of a\nregulatory approval milestone related to previously sold intangible assets.\nInterest Income\nWe invest our cash equivalents and investments in U.S. government securities and other high credit quality debt securities in order to limit default and\nmarket risk.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nInterest income $ 18.1 $ 15.7 $ 2.4 $ 57.2 $ 40.3 $ 16.9\nThe increase in Interest Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 was primarily due to higher balances and higher yields on our cash equivalents and investment portfolio. We expect Interest Income to\ndecrease moderately over the next 12 months due to anticipated interest rates and yields on our cash equivalents and investments.\nInterest Expense\nWe incur interest expense primarily on our convertible debt. Interest Expense for the periods presented was as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nInterest expense $ 3.0 $ 3.8 $ (0.8) $ 10.1 $ 11.2 $ (1.1)\nThe decrease in Interest Expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 was attributed to the maturity of our convertible debt that matured on August 1, 2024 (the 2024 Notes). We expect Interest Expense to\ndecrease over the next 12 months due to the settlement of our 2024 Notes. See Note 6 to our accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional information regarding our debt.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther Income (Expense), Net for the periods presented was as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nOther income (expense), net $ 5.5 $ (0.8) $ 6.3 $ 2.2 $ (18.3) $ 20.5\n26\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\n(In millions of U.S. dollars, except as otherwise disclosed)\nThe increase in Other Income (Expense), Net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30,\n2023 was primarily due to lower foreign currency transaction losses and the absence of the fiscal 2022 refundable tax credits received in 2023 with no\ncomparable credits in 2024. The increase in Other Income (Expense), Net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 was primarily due to the lower foreign currency transaction losses and decreased loss on non-marketable securities.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Provision for Income Taxes for the periods presented was as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nProvision for income taxes $ 28.4 $ 1.3 $ 27.1 $ 70.2 $ 22.0 $ 48.2\nThe increase in Provision for Income Taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 was primarily due to higher year-to-date pre-tax income, a lower tax benefit related to stock option exercises, and a discrete benefit for a\nvaluation allowance release in the third quarter of 2023.\nThere was no material impact resulting from the adoption of Pillar Two of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Base\nErosion and Profit Shifting Project on our financial statements.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nSeptember 30,\n2024 December 31, 2023 Change\nCash and cash equivalents $ 675.4 $ 755.1 $ (79.7)\nShort-term investments 255.0 318.7 (63.7)\nLong-term investments 562.0 611.1 (49.1)\nCash, cash equivalents and investments $ 1,492.4 $ 1,684.9 $ (192.5)\nWe believe cash generated from sales of our commercial products, in addition to our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be\nsufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. We believe we will meet longer-term expected future cash requirements and\nobligations through a combination of cash flows from operating activities and available cash and long-term investment balances. We will need to raise additional\nfunds by issuing equity, debt or convertible securities, taking loans or entering into collaborative or other agreements if we are unable to satisfy our liquidity\nrequirements. For example, we may require additional financing to fund the repayment of our convertible debt due in 2027, future milestone payments and our\nfuture operations, including the commercialization of our products and product candidates currently under development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, and\npotential licenses and acquisitions. The timing and mix of our funding alternatives could change depending on many factors, including how much we elect to\nspend on our development programs, potential licenses and acquisitions of complementary technologies, products and companies or if we settle our convertible\ndebt in cash.\nWe are mindful that conditions in the current macroeconomic environment, such as inflation, changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates,\nnatural disasters, geopolitical instability, and supply chain disruptions could affect our ability to achieve our goals. In addition, we sell our products in certain\ncountries that face economic volatility and weakness. Although we have historically collected receivables from customers in such countries, sustained weakness\nor further deterioration of the local economies and currencies may cause customers in those countries to be unable to pay for our products. We will continue to\n27\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)\n(In millions of U.S. dollars, except as otherwise disclosed)\nmonitor these conditions and will attempt to adjust our business processes, as appropriate, to mitigate macroeconomic risks to our business.\nOur cash flows are summarized as follows:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 387.2 $ 131.8 $ 255.4\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ 60.1 $ (46.3) $ 106.4\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (529.3) $ (29.6) $ (499.7)\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 was primarily\nattributed to the improved operating performance and timing of cash receipts from our customers, partially offset by the timing of payments to vendors, increased\npersonnel-related payments resulting from our ongoing organizational redesign efforts and payment of income taxes.\nThe increase in net cash provided by investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 was primarily\nattributable to lower net purchases of investments and a $10.0 million milestone received in connection with the sale of previously sold intangible assets, partially\noffset by an increase in purchases of intangible assets.\nThe increase in net cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023 was primarily due\nto the $495.0 million settlement of the 2024 Notes, which matured in August 2024.\nFinancing\nOur $600.0 million (undiscounted) of convertible debt as of September 30, 2024 will impact our liquidity due to the semi-annual cash interest payments\nas well as the repayment of the principal amount, if not converted. As of September 30, 2024, our indebtedness consisted of our 1.25% senior subordinated\nconvertible notes due in 2027, which, if not converted, will be required to be repaid in cash at maturity in May 2027.\nFor additional information related to our convertible debt, see Note 6 to our accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 10\n- Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements accompanying our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nIn August 2024, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility providing for $600.0 million in revolving loan commitments. The credit facility is\nintended to finance ongoing working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes. The credit facility contains financial covenants including a\nmaximum total net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The credit facility matures in August 2029. As of September 30, 2024, there were no\namounts outstanding under the credit facility and we were in compliance with all covenants.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nPurchase Obligations\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had obligations of approximately $474.1 million, of which $269.8 million is expected to be paid in 2024. Our purchase\nobligations are primarily related to firm purchase commitments entered into in the normal course of business to procure active pharmaceutical ingredients,\ncertain inventory-related items, certain third-party R&D services, production services and facility construction services. The amount also includes hosting fees\nand other enterprise resource planning (ERP) system implementation costs for which we are committed.\nOther Obligations\nAs of September 30, 2024, we were subject to contingent payments considered reasonably possible of $196.1 million, of this amount we may pay up to\n$4.1 million over the next 12 months if certain contingencies are met.

On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our\nestimates and discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We base our estimates on historical\nexperience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates\nunder different assumptions or conditions. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed\nmaterially from actual results.\nThere have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to those\ndisclosed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2024.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to our accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and our\nexpectation of their impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\n29\nTable of Contents\nItem 3.

Controls and Procedures\n(a) Controls and Procedures\nAn evaluation was carried out, under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our\nChief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), as of the end of the period covered by this report.\nBased on the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures\nwere effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of September 30, 2024.\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how\nwell designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management must apply its judgment in\nevaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide\nreasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of our disclosure controls system are met.\n(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange\nAct, during our most recently completed quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial\nreporting. We continue to utilize the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) 2013 Framework on internal control. We rely\nextensively on information systems and technology to manage our business, including integrated supply chain operations, and global consolidated financial\nresults. We are currently implementing a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which will replace existing operating and financial systems. The\nERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records, support integrated supply chain and other operational functionality, and provide timely\ninformation to our management team related to the operation of the business. We are implementing the ERP system in phases through 2025, with post-\nimplementation activities following thereafter. As the implementation and post-implementation activities take place, we will have changes to certain of our\nprocesses and procedures, and we will evaluate quarterly whether the changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\n30\nTable of Contents\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nOn January 19, 2023 and May 30, 2023, certain of our officers and directors were named as defendants in two shareholder derivative actions filed in\nthe Delaware Court of Chancery. The complaints assert, inter alia, breach of fiduciary duty claims arising from the facts underlying a securities class action\nrelated to ROCTAVIAN that was previously settled in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The derivative complaints seek\nunspecified monetary damages, internal governance reforms by the Company, attorneys’ fees and costs, and any other relief the court may deem just and\nproper. The parties in the derivative lawsuits have entered into a stipulation of settlement, that, subject to final approval by the Court of Chancery, will resolve the\nderivative lawsuits. The Court of Chancery held a final approval hearing on July 23, 2024 and did not approve the settlement. Instead, it instructed the plaintiffs\nto voluntarily dismiss the case or brief a motion to dismiss.\nOn April 4, 2024, a purported stockholder class action was filed against us and our Board of Directors in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The\ncomplaint also named as defendants Elliott Investment Management L.P., Elliott Associates, L.P., and Elliott International, L.P., which are parties to the\nCooperation Agreement with the Company. The complaint asserted a claim for declaratory judgment, seeking an order that certain provisions of the Cooperation\nAgreement are invalid, and, on April 4, 2024, the plaintiff moved for expedited proceedings as to the claim for declaratory judgment. In addition, the complaint\nasserted a claim for breach of fiduciary duty against certain directors in connection with approval of the Cooperation Agreement, as well as a claim against the\nElliott parties for aiding and abetting the directors’ alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. On April 11, 2024, the Elliott parties executed a waiver of the challenged\nprovisions in the Cooperation Agreement. In light of that waiver, on April 16, 2024, the plaintiff filed a stipulation and proposed order to dismiss the action as\nmoot, with the court to retain jurisdiction to determine plaintiff’s counsel’s application for an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses. Also on April 16, 2024, the\nCourt granted the order, dismissing all claims with prejudice, as to the named plaintiff only. The Company subsequently agreed to pay the attorneys’ fees and\nexpenses of the plaintiff in full satisfaction of any and all claims by plaintiff and all of his counsel for fees and expenses in the action. On August 1, 2024, the\nCourt entered an order closing the action, subject to the Company filing an affidavit with the Court regarding issuance of notice. On August 7, 2024, the\nCompany filed an affidavit with the Court indicating that the notice was issued on August 5, 2024.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. We operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing industry that involves numerous risks and\nuncertainties. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Other risks and uncertainties, including those that we do not currently\nconsider material, may impair our business. If any of the risks discussed below actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows\ncould be materially adversely affected. This could cause the value of our securities to decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nWe have marked with an asterisk (*) those risk factors below that include a substantive change from or update to the risk factors included in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on February 26, 2024.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nIf we fail to obtain and maintain an adequate level of coverage and reimbursement for our products by third-party payers, the sales of our\nproducts would be adversely affected or there may be no commercially viable markets for our products.\nThe course of treatment for patients using our products is expensive. For all our products except ROCTAVIAN, we expect patients to need treatment for\nextended periods, and for some products throughout the lifetimes of the patients. We expect that most families of patients will not be capable of paying for this\ntreatment themselves. There will be no commercially viable market for our products without coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Additionally,\neven if there is a commercially viable market, if the level of reimbursement is below our expectations, our revenues and gross margin will be adversely affected.\nThird-party payers, such as government or private healthcare insurers, carefully review and increasingly challenge the prices charged for drugs.\nReimbursement rates from private companies vary depending on the third-party payer, the insurance plan and other factors. Obtaining coverage and adequate\nreimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with drugs administered under the supervision of a\nphysician. Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a\ncountry-by-country basis.\n31\nTable of Contents\nGovernment authorities and other third-party payers are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs, such as by\nlimiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payers are requiring that drug companies provide them\nwith predetermined discounts from list prices as a condition of coverage, are using restrictive formularies and preferred drug lists to leverage greater discounts in\ncompetitive classes, and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for\ndrug products exists among third-party payers in the U.S. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payer to payer.\nAs a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the\nuse of our products to each payer separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first\ninstance.\nWe cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize or will continue to be available for any\nproduct that we have commercialized and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement\nstatus is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be\nimplemented in the future based on new legislation, the availability of alternative therapies and their pricing, coverage and reimbursement decisions by third-\nparty payers, or other factors. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing\napproval. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not successfully commercialize any\nproduct candidate for which we obtain marketing approval or continue to market any product that has already been commercialized.\nReimbursement in the European Union (EU) and many other territories must be negotiated on a country-by-country basis and in many countries the\nproduct cannot be commercially launched until pricing and/or reimbursement is approved. The timing to complete the negotiation process in each country is\nhighly uncertain, and in some countries, we expect that it will exceed 12 months. Even after a price is negotiated, countries frequently request or require\nreductions to the price and other concessions over time.\nFor our future products, we will not know what the reimbursement rates will be until we are ready to market the product and we actually negotiate the\nrates. If we are unable to obtain sufficiently high reimbursement rates for our products, they may not be commercially viable or our future revenues and gross\nmargin may be adversely affected.\n*As compared to our other, more traditional products, gene therapy products may present additional challenges with respect to the pricing,\ncoverage, reimbursement, and acceptance of the product.\nIn addition to the risks set forth in this Risk Factors section associated with commercializing more traditional pharmaceutical drugs, there are additional,\nunique commercial risks associated with gene therapy products like ROCTAVIAN. Due to the relative novelty of gene therapy and the potential to provide\nextended duration therapeutic treatment with a one-time administration, we face uncertainty with respect to the pricing, coverage and reimbursement of these\nproducts. In order to recover our research and development costs and commercialize one-time treatments on a profitable basis, the cost of a single\nadministration of ROCTAVIAN is substantial, and it is likely other gene therapy products would also require relatively high prices. Therefore, coverage and\nreimbursement by governments and other third-party payers is essential for the vast majority of patients to be able to afford ROCTAVIAN or other gene therapy\nproducts that we may commercialize in the future. Accordingly, sales of our gene therapy products will depend substantially on the extent to which its cost will be\npaid by third-party payers. Even if coverage is provided, the reimbursement amounts approved by third-party payers may not be high enough to allow us to\nrealize sufficient revenues from our investment in the development of our gene therapy products.\nWith respect to ROCTAVIAN specifically, we have entered into, and plan to enter into additional, outcomes-based agreements for the product with third-\nparty payers to assist with realizing the value and sharing the risk of a one-time treatment, which make us subject to potential repayments if a patient does not\nrespond to therapy or the therapeutic effect of the drug falls below specified thresholds. Although we have recorded, and will record, reserves for potential\nrefunds under the outcomes-based agreements for ROCTAVIAN in the same period as sales, our revenues and financial results could be adversely affected if\nour assumptions underlying our refund reserves differ from actual experience or otherwise underestimate refund obligations. Additionally, the novelty and\nincreased complexity of reimbursement with outcomes-based arrangements heightens the risk that our price reporting may be inaccurate or delayed, which may\nresult in fines and liability.\nWe also face uncertainty as to whether gene therapy will gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. The commercial success of\nROCTAVIAN or any other gene therapy product candidate that may be approved in the future will depend, in part, on the acceptance of physicians, patients and\nthird-party payers of gene therapy products in general, and our product in particular, as medically necessary, cost-effective and safe. In particular, our success\nwill depend upon physicians prescribing our product in lieu of existing treatments they are already familiar with and for which greater clinical data may be\navailable. Moreover, physicians and patients may delay acceptance of one of our gene therapy treatments until the product has been on the market for a certain\namount of time. Although administration of a gene therapy product like ROCTAVIAN is intended to correct an inborn genetic defect for at least several years,\nthere is a risk that the therapeutic effect will not be durable and production of the desired protein or ribonucleic acid will decrease more quickly or cease entirely\nearlier than expected. If the therapeutic effect decreases\n32\nTable of Contents\nsignificantly or ceases entirely, it is uncertain whether redosing is possible or would be effective. Furthermore, because gene therapy treatment is irreversible,\nthere may be challenges in managing side effects, particularly those caused by potential overproduction of the desired protein. Adverse effects would not be able\nto be reversed or relieved by stopping dosing, and we may have to develop additional clinical safety procedures. Additionally, because the new gene copies are\ndesigned to reside permanently in a patient, there is a risk that they will disrupt other normal biological molecules and processes, including other healthy genes,\nand we may not learn the nature and magnitude of these side effects until long after clinical trials have been completed. Negative public opinion or more\nrestrictive government regulations could have a negative effect on our business and financial condition and may delay or impair the successful commercialization\nof, and demand for, ROCTAVIAN or future gene therapy products.\n*Because the target patient populations for our products are relatively small, we must achieve significant market share and maintain high\nper-patient prices for our products to achieve and maintain profitability.\nAll of our products target diseases with relatively small patient populations. As a result, our per-patient prices must be relatively high in order to recover\nour development and manufacturing costs and achieve and maintain profitability. For BRINEURA, NAGLAZYME and VIMIZIM in particular, we must market\nworldwide to achieve significant market penetration of the product. In addition, because the number of potential patients in each disease population is small, it is\nnot only important to find patients who begin therapy to achieve significant market penetration of the product, but we also need to be able to maintain these\npatients on therapy for an extended period of time. Due to the expected costs of treatment for our products, we may be unable to maintain or obtain sufficient\nmarket share at a price high enough to justify our product development efforts and manufacturing expenses.\n*If we fail to compete successfully with respect to product sales, we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to recover our expenses\nrelated to the development of a product program or to justify continued marketing of a product and our revenues could be adversely affected.\nOur competitors may develop, manufacture and market products that are more effective or less expensive than ours. They may also obtain regulatory\napprovals for their products faster than we can obtain them (including those products with orphan drug designation, which may prevent us from marketing our\nproduct entirely for seven years, along with other regulatory exclusivities that could block approval) or commercialize their products before we do. For example,\nwith respect to ROCTAVIAN, we face a highly developed and competitive market for hemophilia A treatments and with respect to VOXZOGO, other companies\nare developing, and may in the future develop, products for treatment for achondroplasia that, if approved, could potentially compete with VOXZOGO even\nduring the period of orphan drug exclusivity, for example by using an alternative formulation or a different delivery technology. As we commercialize our products,\nwe have faced and may continue to face intense competition from other pharmaceutical companies, some of which may have more extensive resources and/or\nestablished relationships in the communities we seek to treat. If we do not compete successfully, our revenues would be adversely affected, and we may be\nunable to generate sufficient sales to recover our expenses related to the development of a product program or to justify continued marketing of a product.\nChanges in methods of treatment of disease could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect revenues.\nEven if our product candidates are approved, if doctors elect a course of treatment which does not include our products, this decision would reduce\ndemand for our products and adversely affect revenues. For example, if gene therapy becomes widely used as a treatment of genetic diseases, the use of\nenzyme replacement therapy, such as ALDURAZYME, NAGLAZYME, and VIMIZIM in MPS diseases, could be greatly reduced. Changes in treatment method\ncan be caused by the introduction of other companies’ products or the development of new technologies or surgical procedures which may not directly compete\nwith ours, but which have the effect of changing how doctors decide to treat a disease.\nIf we fail to develop new products and product candidates or compete successfully with respect to acquisitions, joint ventures, licenses or\nother collaboration opportunities, our ability to continue to expand our product pipeline and our growth and development would be impaired.\nOur future growth and development depend in part on our ability to successfully develop new products from our development activities. The\ndevelopment of biopharmaceutical products is very expensive and time intensive and involves a great degree of risk. The outcomes of research and\ndevelopment programs, especially for innovative biopharmaceuticals like gene therapy products, are inherently uncertain and may not result in the\ncommercialization of any products.\nOur competitors compete with us to attract organizations for acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing arrangements or other collaborations. To date,\nseveral of our former and current product programs have been acquired through acquisitions and several of our former and current product programs have been\ndeveloped through licensing or collaborative arrangements, such as ALDURAZYME, KUVAN and NAGLAZYME. These collaborations include licensing\nproprietary technology from, and other relationships with, academic research institutions. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to identify\nadditional opportunities and to successfully enter into partnering or acquisition agreements for those opportunities. If our competitors\n33\nTable of Contents\nsuccessfully enter into partnering arrangements or license agreements with academic research institutions, we will then be precluded from pursuing those\nspecific opportunities. Because each of these opportunities is unique, we may not be able to find a substitute. Several pharmaceutical and biotechnology\ncompanies have already established themselves in the field of genetic diseases. These companies have already begun many drug development programs,\nsome of which target diseases that we are also targeting or may target in the future, and have already entered into partnering and licensing arrangements with\nacademic research institutions, reducing the pool of available opportunities.\nUniversities and public and private research institutions also compete with us. While these organizations primarily have educational or basic research\nobjectives, they may develop proprietary technology and acquire patents that we may need for the development of our product candidates. We will attempt to\nlicense this proprietary technology, if available. These licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to compete successfully\nwith respect to acquisitions, joint venture and other collaboration opportunities, we may be limited in our ability to develop new products and to continue to\nexpand our product pipeline.\nThe sale of generic versions of KUVAN by generic manufacturers has adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our revenues\nand may cause a decline in KUVAN revenues faster than expected.\nGeneric versions of KUVAN are available in several countries around the world, including multiple generic versions in the U.S. and the EU. This generic\ncompetition has adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our revenues from KUVAN, and we cannot accurately predict the rate of decline of\nKUVAN revenues in these countries. We are also aware that manufacturers are challenging our patent portfolio related to KUVAN in several jurisdictions, and\nseveral generic versions of KUVAN have been approved either centrally by the European Commission (EC) or on a country-by-country basis throughout the EU.\nIf these patent challenges are successful, or if a manufacturer chooses to offer a generic version of KUVAN, notwithstanding our existing patents, our revenues\nfrom KUVAN may decline faster than expected.\nIf we do not achieve our projected development goals in the timeframes we announce or fail to achieve such goals, the commercialization of\nour product candidates may be delayed or never occur and the credibility of our management may be adversely affected and, as a result, our stock\nprice may decline.\nFor planning purposes, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory and other product development goals,\nwhich we sometimes refer to as milestones. These milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials and the\nsubmission of regulatory filings. From time to time, we publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones. All of these milestones are based on\na variety of assumptions. The actual timing of these milestones can vary dramatically compared to our estimates or the milestones may never be achieved, in\nmany cases for reasons beyond our control. For example, in 2021 and early 2022, we announced that we planned to resubmit our Biologics License Application\n(BLA) for ROCTAVIAN to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the first half of 2022; however, we did not file the BLA until the third quarter of 2022 due to\nthe additional time we needed to include supplemental information and analyses of data requested by the FDA. If we do not meet development milestones as\npublicly announced, the commercialization of our products may be delayed or never occur and the credibility of our management may be adversely affected and,\nas a result, our stock price may decline.\nWe have in the past entered and may in the future enter into licensing arrangements, and we may not realize the benefits of such licensing\narrangements.\nWe have in the past entered and may in the future enter into licensing arrangements with third parties. It is possible that we may not achieve financial or\nstrategic benefits that justify a specific license, or we may otherwise not realize the benefits of such licensing arrangement. Further, licensing arrangements\nimpose various diligence, milestone and royalty payment and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with our obligations under any current or future\nlicenses, our licensors may have the right to terminate these license agreements, which could harm our business prospects, financial condition and results of\noperations. Additionally, counterparties to our license agreements have in the past alleged and may in the future allege that we have breached a license\nagreement, which can result in litigation or other disputes that can divert management’s attention away from our business and require us to expend resources,\nas well as potentially having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms. Any such situation could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nActivist investor actions threatened or commenced against us have and could in the future cause us to incur substantial costs, divert\nmanagement's attention and resources, cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business and adversely affect our business, financial\nposition and results of operations.\nWe have been, and may in the future be, subject to activities initiated by activist investors. In December 2023, we entered into a Cooperation\nAgreement with Elliott Investment Management L.P., Elliott Associates, L.P. and Elliott International, L.P. (collectively, Elliott). We may not be successful in\nengaging constructively with one or more investors in the future despite our efforts to maintain constructive and ongoing communications with all investors,\nincluding Elliott. Resulting actions taken by activist investors from time to time have and could in the future conflict with our strategic direction, divert the attention\nof our Board of\n34\nTable of Contents\nDirectors, management, and employees, be costly and time-consuming, and disrupt the momentum in our business and operations, as well as our ability to\nexecute our strategic plan. These types of actions may also create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy, which may be\nexploited by our competitors and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, and may impact our relationships with investors, vendors,\ncustomers and other third parties. These types of actions could also impact the market price and the volatility of our common stock. In addition, we may choose\nto initiate, or may become subject to, litigation as a result of activist investor actions, which would serve as a further distraction to our Board of Directors, senior\nmanagement and employees and could require us to incur significant additional costs.\nRegulatory Risks\nIf we fail to obtain regulatory approval to commercially market and sell our product candidates, or if approval of our product candidates is\ndelayed, we will be unable to generate revenues from the sale of these product candidates, our potential for generating positive cash flow will be\ndiminished, and the capital necessary to fund our operations will increase.\nWe must obtain regulatory approval to market and sell our product candidates. For example, in the U.S., we must obtain FDA approval for each product\ncandidate that we intend to commercialize, and in the EU, we must obtain approval from the EC, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products\nfor Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The FDA and EC approval processes are typically lengthy and expensive, and approval is\nnever certain. To obtain regulatory approval, we must first show that our product candidates are safe and effective for target indications through preclinical\nstudies and clinical trials. Preclinical studies and clinical development are long, expensive and uncertain processes. Completion of clinical trials may take several\nyears, and failure may occur at any stage of development. The length of time required varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and\nintended use of a product candidate. Interim results of a preclinical test or clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results, and acceptable results in early\nclinical trials may not be repeated in later clinical trials. Accordingly, there are no assurances that we will obtain regulatory approval for any of our product\ncandidates. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that approval of one of our product candidates by one regulatory authority will mean that other authorities\nwill also approve the same product candidate. Similarly, in the EU, a positive CHMP opinion for approval of a product candidate does not guarantee that the EC\nwill approve the product candidate. Moreover, regulatory authorities may approve a product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than requested. In\naddition, regulatory authorities may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product\ncandidates.\nWe have had fewer interactions with regulatory authorities outside the U.S. and the EU as compared to our interactions with the FDA, the EC and the\nEMA. The approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional clinical testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that\nrequired to obtain FDA or EC approval. Moreover, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries.\nApproval by the FDA or EC does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one or more non-U.S. regulatory authorities\ndoes not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other non-U.S. countries or by the FDA or EC. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval\nin one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. The non-U.S. regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated\nwith obtaining FDA or EC approval. We may not obtain non-U.S. regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. We may not be able to file for regulatory\napprovals and even if we file, we may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our product candidates in any market.\nWe also rely on independent third-party Contract Research Organizations (CROs) to file some of our non-U.S. marketing applications, and while we\nkeep a close oversight on the activities we delegate to CROs, important aspects of the services performed for us by the CROs are out of our direct control. If we\nfail to adequately manage our CROs, if the CRO elects to prioritize work on our projects below other projects or if there is any dispute or disruption in our\nrelationship with our CROs, the filing of our applications may be delayed.\nAlthough the FDA, the EC and the EMA have programs to facilitate expedited development and accelerated approval processes, the timelines agreed\nunder legislative goals or mandated by regulations are subject to the possibility of substantial delays. Accordingly, even if any of our applications receives a\ndesignation to facilitate expedited development and accelerated approval processes, these designations may not result in faster review or approval for our\nproduct candidates compared to product candidates considered for approval under conventional procedures and, in any event, do not assure ultimate approval\nof our product candidates by regulatory authorities. In addition, the FDA, the EC, the EMA and other comparable international regulatory authorities have\nsubstantial discretion over the approval process for pharmaceutical products. These regulatory authorities may not agree that we have demonstrated the\nrequisite level of product safety and efficacy to warrant approval and may require, and in the past have required, additional data. If we fail to obtain regulatory\napproval for our product candidates, we will be unable to market and sell those product candidates, which would have a negative effect on our business and\nfinancial condition.\nRegulatory authorities and the new requirements and guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform\nadditional or larger studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and\ncommercialization of our product candidates or lead to significant post-approval studies, limitations or restrictions. For example, on August 18, 2020, the FDA\nissued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) to our BLA\n35\nTable of Contents\nfor ROCTAVIAN for the treatment of adults with severe hemophilia A. In the CRL, the FDA introduced a new request for two-year follow-up safety and efficacy\ndata on all study participants from our ongoing Phase 3 study of ROCTAVIAN. In January 2022, we announced results from the requested two-year data\nanalysis from our Phase 3 study. In the third quarter of 2022, we resubmitted our BLA, and the FDA subsequently accepted our submission with an original\nPrescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of March 31, 2023. In early 2023, we supplemented our BLA by submitting our three-year analysis of\nthe global Phase 3 study of ROCTAVIAN, which the FDA deemed to be a Major Amendment to our BLA due to the substantial amount of additional data, and\nextended the PDUFA target action date by three months. The FDA approved ROCTAVIAN for the treatment of adults with severe hemophilia A on June 29, 2023.\nFurther, on April 26, 2023, the EC adopted a proposal for a new Directive and Regulation to revise the existing pharmaceutical legislation. If adopted in the form\nproposed, the recent EC proposals to revise the existing EU laws governing authorization of medicinal products may result in a decrease in data and market\nexclusivity for our product candidates in the EU.\nIn addition, some of our product candidates are intended to be used in combination with a medical device, such as an injector or other delivery system.\nSome of these products intended to be used with a medical device may be regulated as “combination products” in the U.S. and the EU, which are generally\ndefined as products consisting of components from two or more regulatory categories (e.g., drug/device, device/biologic, drug/biologic). In the U.S., each\ncomponent of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component, whether a new drug, biologic or device. In\norder to facilitate pre-market review of combination products, the FDA designates one of its centers to have primary jurisdiction for the pre-market review and\nregulation of the overall product based upon a determination by the FDA of the primary mode of action of the combination product. The determination whether a\nproduct is a combination product or two separately regulated products is made by the FDA on a case-by-case basis. In the EU, medical devices and medicinal\nproducts are regulated separately, through different legislative instruments. The related applicable requirements will vary depending on the type of drug-device\ncombination product. If, for example, a device intended to administer a medicinal product is sold together with such medicinal product in such a way that they\nform a single integral product which is intended exclusively for use in the given combination and which is not reusable, that single integral product is regulated as\na medicinal product. In addition, the relevant general safety and performance requirements (GSPRs) established for medical devices by EU medical devices\nlegislation apply to the device component of such combination products. In addition, some of our products require use with an in vitro companion diagnostic. For\nexample, ROCTAVIAN is approved with a companion diagnostic test intended to detect pre-existing anti-AAV5 antibodies, which may render the gene therapy\nless effective or ineffective. Our other products and product candidates may also require use with an in vitro companion diagnostic if the FDA determines that the\ncompanion diagnostic is essential for safe and effective use of the product candidate. The FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic,\nknown as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. Most companion diagnostics require approval of a\npremarket approval application. In the EU, companion diagnostics are deemed to be in vitro diagnostic medical devices and must conform with the applicable\nGSPRs. To demonstrate compliance with the GSPRs, companion diagnostics must undergo a conformity assessment by a Notified Body. If the related medicinal\nproduct has been, or is in the process of being, authorized through the centralized procedure for the authorization of medicinal products, the Notified Body will,\nbefore it can issue a CE Certificate of Conformity, be required to seek a scientific opinion from the EMA on the suitability of the companion diagnostic for use in\nrelation to the medicinal product concerned. For medicinal products that have been or are in the process of authorization through any other route provided in EU\nlegislation, the Notified Body must seek the opinion of the national competent authority of an EU Member State. Our product candidates intended for use with\nseparately regulated devices, such as companion diagnostics, or expanded indications that we may seek for our products used with such devices, may not be\napproved or may be substantially delayed in receiving approval if the devices do not gain and/or maintain their own regulatory approvals, clearances, or\ncertifications. Where approval of the drug or biologic product and device is sought under a single application, such as a drug with an injector or delivery system,\nthe increased complexity of the review process may delay approval. The FDA and EU review processes and related criteria are complex, which could also lead\nto delays in the approval process. In addition, because these devices are provided by unaffiliated third-party companies, we are dependent on the sustained\ncooperation and effort of those third-party companies both to obtain regulatory approval and to maintain their own regulatory compliance. Failure of third-party\ncompanies to assist in the approval process or to maintain their own regulatory compliance could delay or prevent approval of our product candidates, or limit\nour ability to sell a product once it is approved.\nFurthermore, despite our recent success obtaining regulatory approval for ROCTAVIAN in the U.S. and conditional approval in the EU, we may\nexperience regulatory challenges for other gene therapy product candidates that cause significant delays or unanticipated costs, or that cannot be solved.\nAlthough numerous companies are currently advancing gene therapy product candidates through clinical trials, the FDA and EC have only approved a relatively\nsmall number of vector-based gene therapy products thus far. As a result, it is difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain\nregulatory approvals for our future gene therapy product candidates in any jurisdiction. Regulatory requirements governing gene and cell therapy products are\nstill evolving and may continue to change in the future. Further, the FDA continues to develop and publish new guidance and policies, generally, by releasing one\nor more gene therapy-specific guidance documents each year. These guidance documents and other recent policy statements demonstrate that regulatory\nrequirements for gene therapies are likely to continue to evolve based upon factors such as the intended disease or class of diseases, product type or\nmechanism of action, broader considerations such as the kinds of evidence that will be required for gene therapy products to take advantage of expedited\ndevelopment programs, and the experiences obtained by FDA when applying their legal and regulatory authorities to an evolving field, like gene therapy\nproducts. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval\n36\nTable of Contents\nnecessary to bring our gene therapy product candidates to market could have a negative effect on our business and financial condition.\nFrom time to time during the development and regulatory approval process for our products and product candidates, we engage in discussions with the\nFDA, the EC, the EMA and other comparable international regulatory authorities regarding our development programs, including discussions about the\nregulatory requirements for approval. As part of these discussions, we sometimes seek advice in the design of our clinical programs from various regulatory\nauthorities globally, but we do not always follow such guidance. This increases the chance of adverse regulatory actions, but we try to always provide\nappropriate scientific evidence to support approval. Moreover, sometimes different regulatory authorities provide different or conflicting advice. While we attempt\nto harmonize the advice we receive from multiple regulatory authorities, it is not always practical to do so. Also, we may choose not to harmonize conflicting\nadvice when harmonization would significantly delay clinical trial data or is otherwise inappropriate. If we are unable to effectively and efficiently resolve and\ncomply with the inquiries and requests of the FDA, the EC, the EMA and other comparable international regulatory authorities, the approval of our product\ncandidates may be delayed and their value may be reduced.\nAny product for which we have obtained regulatory approval, or for which we obtain approval in the future, is subject to, or will be subject to,\nextensive ongoing regulatory requirements by the FDA, the EC, the EMA and other comparable international regulatory authorities, and if we fail to\ncomply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, we may be subject to penalties, we will be unable\nto generate revenues from the sale of such products, our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished, and the capital necessary to\nfund our operations will be increased.\nOur products have received regulatory approval to be commercially marketed and sold in the U.S., the EU, and certain other countries except\nROCTAVIAN, which has received regulatory approval to be commercially marketed in the U.S. and conditional approval to be commercially marketed in the EU.\nAny product for which we have obtained regulatory approval, or for which we obtain regulatory approval in the future, along with the manufacturing processes\nand practices, post-approval clinical research, product labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, are subject to continual requirements of,\nand review by, the FDA, the EC, the EMA and/or other comparable international and national regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of\nsafety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) requirements\nrelating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, import and export requirements and\nrecord keeping.\nAn example of the ongoing regulatory requirements our products are subject to is the PALYNZIQ Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)\nprogram. In the U.S., PALYNZIQ is only available through the REMS program, which is required by the FDA to mitigate the risk of anaphylaxis while using the\nproduct. Notable requirements of our REMS program include the following:\n• prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the REMS program and completing training;\n• prescribers must prescribe auto-injectable epinephrine with PALYNZIQ;\n• pharmacies must be certified with the REMS program and must dispense PALYNZIQ only to patients who are authorized to receive it;\n• patients must enroll in the REMS program and be educated about the risk of anaphylaxis by a certified prescriber to ensure they understand the risks\nand benefits of treatment with PALYNZIQ; and\n• patients must have auto-injectable epinephrine available at all times while taking PALYNZIQ.\nFailure of prescribers, pharmacies or patients to enroll in our REMS program or to successfully complete and comply with its requirements may result in\nregulatory action from the FDA or decreased sales of PALYNZIQ. The restrictions and requirements under our REMS program, as well as potential changes to\nthese restrictions and requirements in the future, subject us to increased risks and uncertainties, any of which could harm our business. The requirement for a\nREMS program can materially affect the potential market for and profitability of a drug. We cannot predict whether the FDA will request, seek to require or\nultimately require modifications to, or impose additional requirements on, the PALYNZIQ REMS program, or whether the FDA will permit modifications to the\nPALYNZIQ REMS program that we consider warranted. Any modifications required or rejected by the FDA could make it more difficult or expensive for us to\ndistribute PALYNZIQ in the U.S., impair the safety profile of PALYNZIQ, disrupt continuity of care for PALYNZIQ patients and/or negatively affect sales of\nPALYNZIQ.\nIn addition, in the EU, the marketing authorization for BRINEURA was granted under “exceptional circumstances”. As a result, the risk-benefit balance\nof BRINEURA is reviewed annually and the marketing authorization may be withdrawn if the risk-benefit ratio is no longer favorable. The conditional marketing\nauthorization for ROCTAVIAN is, moreover, valid for one year and must be reviewed annually until all related conditions have been fulfilled to permit transfer to a\nfull authorization. Failure to continue to show favorable risk-benefit balance for BRINEURA or satisfy the conditions related to ROCTAVIAN’s conditional\nmarketing authorization could result in the withdrawal of the marketing approvals for these products.\n37\nTable of Contents\nMoreover, promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs, including biologics, are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions\nand must be consistent with the information in the product’s approved labeling and Summary of Product Characteristics. In particular, a product may not be\npromoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA or the EC as reflected in the product’s approved labeling. Although the FDA and other comparable\ninternational and national regulatory authorities do not regulate a physician’s choice of drug treatment made in the physician’s independent medical judgment,\nthey do restrict promotional communications from companies or their sales force with respect to off-label uses of products for which marketing clearance has not\nbeen issued. The FDA and other national competent authorities or international regulatory authorities actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the\npromotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant civil, criminal and\nadministrative penalties. Thus, we are not able to promote any products we develop for indications or uses for which they are not approved. Additionally, in the\nEU, it is prohibited to promote prescription drugs to the general public and we are therefore limited to promote our products exclusively to healthcare\nprofessionals. Public prosecutors, industry associations, healthcare professionals and other members of the public closely scrutinize advertising and promotion\nof any product in the EU.\nMoreover, if original FDA approval for one of our product candidates is granted via the accelerated approval pathway, we will be required to conduct a\npost-marketing confirmatory trial to verify and describe the clinical benefit in support of full approval. An unsuccessful post-marketing study or failure to complete\nsuch a study with due diligence could result in the withdrawal of the FDA’s marketing approval for a product candidate. For example, VOXZOGO is approved in\nthe U.S. under accelerated approval based on an improvement in annualized growth velocity. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon\nverification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory studies. To fulfill this post-marketing requirement, we intend to use our ongoing open-label extension\nstudies compared to available natural history. In addition, the FDA and the EC often require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of\nproducts. The FDA, the EC and other comparable international regulatory authorities may condition approval of our product candidates on the completion of\nsuch post-marketing clinical studies. These post-marketing studies may suggest that a product causes undesirable side effects or may present a risk to the\npatient.\nDiscovery after approval of previously unknown problems with any of our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with\nregulatory requirements, may result in actions such as:\n• the issuance of safety alerts, press releases or other communications containing warnings about related products;\n• modifications to promotional materials or corrective information to healthcare professionals;\n• restrictions on our ability to conduct clinical trials, including full or partial clinical holds on ongoing or planned trials;\n• suspensions or restrictions on our operations, including product manufacturing processes;\n• restrictions on the marketing of a product;\n• restrictions on product distribution;\n• requirements to conduct post-marketing clinical trials;\n• untitled or warning letters or other adverse publicity;\n• withdrawal of the products from the market;\n• suspended or withdrawn regulatory approvals;\n• refusal or delays to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n• recall of products;\n• refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n• product seizure;\n• fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n• injunctions; or\n• imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nIf such regulatory actions are taken, our value and our operating results will be adversely affected. Additionally, if the FDA, the EC or any other\ncomparable international regulatory authorities withdraws its approval of a product, we will be unable to generate revenues from the sale of that product in the\nrelevant jurisdiction, our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished and the capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased.\nAccordingly, we continue to expend significant time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product\nsurveillance, post-marketing studies and quality control.\nTo obtain regulatory approval to market our products, preclinical studies and costly and lengthy clinical trials are required and the results of\nthe studies and trials are highly uncertain. Likewise, preliminary, initial or interim data from\n38\nTable of Contents\nclinical trials should be considered carefully and with caution because the final data may be materially different from the preliminary, initial or interim\ndata, particularly as more patient data become available.\nAs part of the drug development process, we must conduct, at our own expense, preclinical studies in the laboratory, including studies in animals, and\nclinical trials on humans for each product candidate. The number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that regulatory authorities require varies depending on\nthe product candidate, the disease or condition the drug is being developed to address and regulations applicable to the particular drug. Generally, new drugs for\ndiseases or conditions that affect larger patient populations, are less severe, or are treatable by alternative strategies must be validated through additional\npreclinical and clinical trials and/or clinical trials with higher enrollments. With respect to our early-stage product candidates, we may need to perform multiple\npreclinical studies using various doses and formulations before we can begin clinical trials, which could result in delays to our development timeline.\nFurthermore, even if we obtain favorable results in preclinical studies, the results in humans may be significantly different. After we have conducted preclinical\nstudies, we must demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and efficacious for the intended indication and for use in the targeted human patients in order\nto receive regulatory approval for commercial sale. Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain.\nFailure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be\npredictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials, and favorable data from interim analyses do not ensure the final results of a trial will be favorable. From time\nto time, we have published and may in the future publish or report preliminary, initial or interim data from our clinical trials. Preliminary, initial or interim data from\nour clinical trials may not be indicative of the final results of the trial and are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change\nas patient enrollment continues and/or more patient data become available. In this regard, such data may show initial evidence of clinical benefit, but as patients\ncontinue to be followed and more patient data become available, there is a risk that any therapeutic effects will not be durable in patients and/or will decrease\nover time or cease entirely. Preliminary, initial or interim data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being\nmaterially different from such preliminary, initial or interim data. As a result, preliminary, initial or interim data should be considered carefully and with caution until\nthe final data are available.\nProduct candidates may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials,\nor despite having favorable data in connection with an interim analysis. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant\nsetbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Also, as noted above, we\ndo not always follow the advice of regulatory authorities or comply with all of their requests regarding the design of our clinical programs. In those cases, we may\nchoose a development program that is inconsistent with the advice of regulatory authorities, which may limit the jurisdictions where we conduct clinical trials\nand/or adversely affect our ability to obtain approval in those jurisdictions where we do not follow the regulatory advice.\nAdverse or inconclusive clinical results could stop us from obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates. Additional factors that can cause\ndelay or termination of our clinical trials include:\n• slow or insufficient patient enrollment;\n• slow recruitment of, and completion of necessary institutional approvals at, clinical sites;\n• budgetary constraints or prohibitively high clinical trial costs;\n• longer treatment time required to demonstrate efficacy;\n• lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate;\n• adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients, including immune reactions;\n• lack of effectiveness of the product candidate being tested;\n• availability of competitive therapies to treat the same indication as our product candidates;\n• regulatory requests for additional clinical trials or preclinical studies;\n• deviations in standards for Good Clinical Practice (GCP); and\n• disputes with or disruptions in our relationships with clinical trial partners, including CROs, clinical laboratories, clinical sites, and principal\ninvestigators.\nGovernment price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our current and\nfuture products, which would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nWe expect that coverage and reimbursement may be increasingly restricted in all the markets in which we sell our products. The escalating cost of\nhealthcare has led to increased pressure on the healthcare industry to reduce costs. In particular, drug pricing by pharmaceutical companies has been under\nscrutiny for many years and continues to be subject to intense political and public debate in the U.S. and abroad. Governmental and private third-party payers\nhave proposed healthcare reforms and cost reductions. A number of federal and state proposals to control the cost of healthcare, including the cost of drug\ntreatments, have\n39\nTable of Contents\nbeen made in the U.S. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed bills and enacted legislation designed to, among\nother things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government\nprogram reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Further, Congress and the executive branch have each indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative\nand/or administrative measures to control drug costs. In some international markets, the government controls the pricing, which can affect the profitability of\ndrugs. Current government regulations and possible future legislation regarding healthcare may affect coverage and reimbursement for medical treatment by\nthird-party payers, which may render our products not commercially viable or may adversely affect our future revenues and gross margins.\nInternational operations are also generally subject to extensive price and market regulations, and there are many proposals for additional cost-\ncontainment measures, including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or mandatory price cuts or reduce the value of our\nintellectual property portfolio. As part of these cost containment measures, some countries have imposed and continue to propose revenue caps limiting the\nannual volume of sales of our products. Some of these caps are significantly below the actual demand in certain countries, and if the trend regarding revenue\ncaps continues, our future revenues and gross margins may be adversely affected. For example, in the EU, governments influence the price of medicinal\nproducts through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to\nconsumers. EU Member States are free to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and\nto control the prices of medicinal products for human use. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be\nmarketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. An EU Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it\nmay instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market, including volume-based\narrangements, caps and reference pricing mechanisms. Other EU Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control\ncompany profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, has become very intense. Pharmaceutical products\nmay face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with\nimported foreign products. Furthermore, there is no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication or\ncost-effective by third-party payers. There is also no assurance that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that\nthe third-party payers’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our business.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory developments. However,\nfuture price controls or other changes in pricing regulation or negative publicity related to our product pricing or the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs generally\ncould restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our current and future products or our sales volume, which would adversely affect our revenues and\nresults of operations.\nGovernment healthcare reform could increase our costs and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nOur industry is highly regulated and changes in law may adversely impact our business, operations or financial results. In the U.S., there have been\nand continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. In the U.S., there have been several recent congressional inquiries, proposed\nand enacted federal and state legislation and executive action designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship\nbetween pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies\nfor drug products. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private\npayers. Recently, several healthcare reform initiatives culminated in the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022, which allows, among\nother things, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to negotiate the selling price of a statutorily specified number of drugs and biologics each\nyear that the CMS reimburses under Medicare Part B and Part D. Only high-expenditure single-source drugs that have been approved for at least 7 years (11\nyears for biologics) can be selected by CMS for negotiation. The IRA permits the Secretary of HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as\nopposed to regulation, for the initial years. HHS has and will continue to issue and update guidance as these programs are implemented. Manufacturers that fail\nto comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties. The IRA's provisions are taking effect progressively starting in\n2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. Thus, while it is unclear how the IRA will be implemented, it will likely have a significant impact on the\npharmaceutical industry.\nPrior to the IRA, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010\n(collectively, the PPACA) is a sweeping measure intended to, among other things, expand healthcare coverage within the U.S., primarily through the imposition\nof health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the Medicaid program. Several provisions of the law have affected us and\nincreased certain of our costs. Since its enactment, there have been executive, judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. Although\nthe PPACA has generally been upheld thus far, it is unclear how continued challenges to the law may impact the PPACA and our business. In addition, other\nlegislative changes have been adopted since the PPACA was enacted. Some of these changes have resulted in additional reductions in Medicare and other\nhealthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, accordingly, our financial operations.\n40\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, individual states in the U.S. have also increasingly enacted laws and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product\npricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, price disclosure and reporting requirements, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and\nmarketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\nMoreover, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and\nwhich suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs.\nLikewise, in many EU Member States, legislators and other policymakers continue to propose and implement healthcare cost-containing measures in\nresponse to the increased attention being paid to healthcare costs in the EU. Certain of these changes could impose limitations on the prices we will be able to\ncharge for our commercial products and any product candidates or the amounts of reimbursement available for these products from governmental and private\nthird-party payers, may increase the tax obligations on pharmaceutical companies or may facilitate the introduction of generic competition with respect to our\nproducts. Further, an increasing number of EU Member States and other non-U.S. countries use prices for medicinal products established in other countries as\n“reference prices” to help determine the price of the product in their own territory. If the price of one of our products decreases substantially in a reference price\ncountry, it could impact the price for that product in other countries. Consequently, a downward trend in prices of our products in some countries could contribute\nto similar downward trends elsewhere, which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. Moreover, some EU Member\nStates require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular medicinal product candidate to currently available\ntherapies. This Health Technology Assessment (HTA) process, which is currently governed by the national laws of the individual EU Member States, is the\nprocedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal\nproduct in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence\nthe pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States. In 2022, the EC\nadopted the HTA regulation, which is intended to boost cooperation among EU Member States in evaluating new medicinal products. The HTA regulation will\napply starting in 2025 and may result in increased downward pricing pressure in the EU.\nWe anticipate that the IRA, PPACA and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future in the U.S. or abroad, may result in more\nrigorous coverage criteria and an additional downward pressure on the reimbursement our customers may receive for our products. Legally mandated price\ncontrols on payment amounts by governmental and private third-party payers or other restrictions could harm our business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and prospects. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue,\nattain profitability or commercialize our products.\nIf we fail to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for some of our products, our competitors may obtain approval to sell the same drugs\nto treat the same conditions and our revenues will be reduced.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have developed and may in the future develop some drugs that may be eligible for FDA and EU orphan drug\ndesignation. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a\npatient population of fewer than 200,000 in the U.S. or as a condition that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable\nexpectation that the costs of development of said drug will be recovered from sales in the U.S. In the EU, pursuant to the Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 (the\nOrphan Regulation), as implemented by Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000, orphan drug designation is available if a sponsor can establish that: (1) the medicine is\nintended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than five in 10,000 people in the EU\nat the time the application is made, or, (2) that it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and\nchronic condition in the EU and that without incentives derived from the orphan status, it is unlikely that the marketing of the medicine in the EU would generate\nsufficient return to justify the necessary investment. In both cases, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis,\nprevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the medicine will be of significant benefit to\nthose affected by that condition.\nIn the U.S., the company that first obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for a given rare disease receives marketing exclusivity for use of\nthat drug for the designated condition for a period of seven years. Orphan drug exclusive marketing rights may be lost if the FDA later determines that the\nrequest for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug. In addition, the FDA may approve\nanother drug during a period of orphan drug exclusivity if the second drug is found to be clinically superior to the first drug. In the EU, a ten-year period of market\nexclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication (extendable to twelve years for orphan drugs that have complied with an agreed Pediatric Investigation Plan\n(PIP) pursuant to Regulation 1901/2006), during which the EMA cannot accept another marketing authorization application or accept an application to extend\nexisting authorizations for similar medicinal products for the same indication and no related marketing authorization (MA) can be granted. MAs may also be\ngranted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if: (i) the applicant can establish that the second medicinal product, although similar to the\norphan medicinal product already authorized is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan medicinal product already authorized; (ii) the\nMA holder for the first orphan medicinal product grants its consent; or (iii) if the MA holder of the orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient\nquantities. MAs may also be granted for the same therapeutic indication in relation\n41\nTable of Contents\nto products that are not similar. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it can be demonstrated on\nthe basis of available evidence that the criteria for its designation as an orphan medicine are no longer satisfied, for example if the original orphan medicinal\nproduct has become sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Because the extent and scope of patent protection for some of our\nproducts is limited, orphan drug designation and resulting regulatory exclusivity is especially important for our products that are eligible for orphan drug\ndesignation. For eligible products, we plan to rely on the exclusivity period under the Orphan Drug Act and/or the Orphan Regulation, as applicable, to maintain a\ncompetitive position. If we do not obtain orphan drug designation and related regulatory exclusivity for our products that do not have broad patent protection or if\na competing product is determined to be \"clinically superior\" to any of our products that has secured orphan drug exclusivity, our competitors may then sell the\nsame drug to treat the same condition and our revenues will be reduced.\nEven though we have obtained orphan drug designation for certain of our product candidates and even if we obtain orphan drug designation for our\nfuture product candidates, due to the uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval\nfor any particular orphan indication, which means that we may not obtain orphan drug regulatory exclusivity and could also potentially be blocked from approval\nof certain product candidates until the competitor product’s orphan drug exclusivity period expires. Moreover, with respect to certain biologics and gene\ntherapies, there may be some uncertainty regarding how similarity between product candidates designed to treat the same rare disease or condition may affect\nsuch product candidates’ orphan drug regulatory exclusivities. For biologics and gene therapies, the FDA’s determination of whether a drug is the same drug or a\ndifferent drug will be based on the principal molecular structural features of the products. For gene therapy products, the FDA has stated in guidance that it\ngenerally intends to consider certain key features such as transgenes and vectors used in gene therapy products to be principal molecular structural features.\nThe FDA has not yet proffered additional information on orphan drug sameness for gene therapy or similar products. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug\nexclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition\nand the same drug can be approved for different conditions and potentially used off-label in the orphan indication. Even after an orphan drug is approved and\ngranted orphan drug exclusivity, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer or\nmore effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug,\nnor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nWe may face competition from biosimilars approved through an abbreviated regulatory pathway.\nOur ALDURAZYME, BRINEURA, NAGLAZYME, PALYNZIQ, ROCTAVIAN and VIMIZIM products are regulated by the FDA as biologics under the\nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act). Biologics require the submission of a BLA and licensure by the FDA\nprior to being marketed in the U.S. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) created a regulatory pathway under the PHS Act for the\nabbreviated licensure of biological products that are demonstrated to be “biosimilar” to or “interchangeable” with an FDA-licensed biological product. A similar\nabridged MA process is available to biosimilar products in the EU. In particular, applicants for MAs of biosimilars are required to demonstrate through\ncomprehensive comparability studies with the reference biological medicine that: a) their biological medicine is highly similar to the reference medicine,\nnotwithstanding natural variability inherent to all biological medicines; and b) there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar and the\nreference medicine in terms of safety, quality and efficacy.\nIn the U.S., in order to meet the standard of interchangeability, a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the\nsame clinical result as the reference product in any given patient, and for a product that is administered more than once, that the risk of switching in terms of\nsafety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the reference product and biosimilar product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the\npatient on the reference product. The BPCIA establishes a period of 12 years of data exclusivity for reference products but such data exclusivity only blocks\nlicensure of biosimilars relying on the product as a reference product; it will not prevent the licensure of the same product for the same or different indications\nthat does not seek to rely on reference product data. In the EU, a medicinal product containing a new active substance benefits from eight years of data\nexclusivity, during which biosimilar applications referring to the data of that product may not be accepted by the regulatory authorities, and a further two years of\nmarket exclusivity, during which biosimilar applications may be submitted and the reference product's data may be referenced but biosimilar products may not be\nplaced on the market. The two-year period may be extended to three years if during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical\nbenefit over existing therapies is approved. Our products approved under BLAs in the U.S. or as a result of Marketing Authorization Applications (MAAs) in the\nEU, as well as our product candidates that may be approved in the future, could be reference products for biosimilar marketing applications.\nChanges in funding for the FDA, the EMA, other comparable regulatory authorities and other government agencies or government\nshutdowns could hinder the ability of such authorities and agencies to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel or otherwise prevent those\nauthorities and agencies from performing normal functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our\nbusiness.\nChanges in funding levels of regulatory authorities and government agencies can affect their ability to hire and retain key personnel and carry out their\nnormal functions that support our business. For example, the ability of the FDA or the EMA to timely\n42\nTable of Contents\nreview and approve INDs or MAAs for our product candidates may be hindered by a lack of resources and qualified personnel. In addition, funding of other\nregulatory authorities and government agencies on which our operations rely, including those that fund research and development activities, is subject to the\npolitical budget process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nGovernment shutdowns could also impact the ability of regulatory authorities and government agencies to function normally and support our operations.\nFor example, the U.S. federal government has shut down repeatedly since 1980, including for a period of 35 days beginning on December 22, 2018. During a\nshutdown, certain regulatory authorities and agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough key personnel and stop critical activities. If a prolonged\ngovernment shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\nFinancial and Financing Risks\nIf we incur operating losses or are unable to sustain positive cash flows for a period longer than anticipated, we may be unable to continue\nour operations at planned levels and may be forced to reduce our operations.\nSince we began operations in March 1997, we have been engaged in substantial research and development and capital investments, and we have\noperated at a net loss for most years since our inception and there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain profitability in the future. Our future\nprofitability and cash flows depend on our marketing and selling of our products, the receipt of regulatory approval of our product candidates, our ability to\nsuccessfully manufacture and market any products, either by ourselves or jointly with others, our spending on our development programs, the impact of any\npossible future business development transactions and other risks set forth in this Risk Factors section. The extent of our future losses and the timing of\nprofitability and positive cash flows are highly uncertain. If we are unable to sustain profitability and positive cash flows on a continuing basis, then we may be\nunable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.\n*If we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected and\nwe will have to delay or terminate some or all of our product development programs.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $1.5 billion and debt obligations of $600.0 million (undiscounted),\nwhich consisted of our 1.25% senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2027 (the 2027 Notes). The 2027 Notes, if not converted, will be required to be repaid\nin cash at maturity in May 2027. We will need cash not only to pay the ongoing interest due on the 2027 Notes during their term, but also to repay the principal\namount of the 2027 Notes if not converted.\nWe may require additional financing to fund the repayment of the 2027 Notes, future milestone payments and our future operations, including the\ncommercialization of our products and product candidates currently under development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, and potential licenses and\nacquisitions. We may be unable to raise additional financing due to a variety of factors, including our financial condition, the status of our product programs, and\nthe general condition of the financial markets. If we fail to raise any necessary additional financing we may have to delay or terminate some or all of our product\ndevelopment programs and our financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected.\nWe expect to continue to spend substantial amounts of capital for our operations for the foreseeable future. The amount of capital we will need depends\non many factors, including:\n• our ability to successfully market and sell our products;\n• the time and cost necessary to develop commercial manufacturing processes, including quality systems, and to build or acquire manufacturing\ncapabilities the progress and success of our preclinical studies and clinical trials (including studies and the manufacture of materials);\n• the timing, number, size and scope of our preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n• the time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and the costs of post-marketing studies which may be required by regulatory\nauthorities;\n• the progress of research programs carried out by us;\n• any changes made to, or new developments in, our existing collaborative, licensing and other commercial relationships or any new collaborative,\nlicensing and other commercial relationships that we may establish;\n• Sanofi’s ability to continue to successfully commercialize ALDURAZYME; and\n• whether our convertible debt is converted to common stock in the future.\nMoreover, our fixed expenses such as rent, license payments, interest expense and other contractual commitments are substantial and may increase in\nthe future. These fixed expenses may increase because we may enter into:\n43\nTable of Contents\n• additional licenses and collaborative agreements;\n• additional contracts for product manufacturing; and\n• additional financing facilities or arrangements.\nWe will need to raise additional funds from equity or debt securities, loans or collaborative agreements if we are unable to satisfy our liquidity\nrequirements. The sale of additional equity and/or equity-linked securities will result in additional dilution to our stockholders. Furthermore, additional financing\nmay not be available in amounts or on terms satisfactory to us or at all. This could result in the delay, reduction or termination of our research, which could harm\nour business.\n*We have incurred substantial indebtedness that may decrease our business flexibility, access to capital, and/or increase our borrowing\ncosts, which may adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $600.0 million (undiscounted) principal amount of indebtedness, all of which was outstanding under the 2027 Notes.\nIn August 2024, we entered into an unsecured credit agreement (the 2024 Credit Agreement) with Citibank, N.A., as the administrative agent, and the other\nlenders party thereto, providing for $600.0 million in revolving loan commitments (the 2024 Credit Facility). The 2024 Credit Facility matures in August 2029. As\nof September 30, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facility. Our indebtedness may:\n• limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n• limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general\nbusiness purposes;\n• require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;\n• limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n• increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIn addition, the 2024 Credit Facility contains, and any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain, financial and other restrictive covenants that\nlimit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our other indebtedness. If we fail to comply with these covenants or to make\npayments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that and our other indebtedness\nbecoming immediately payable in full. If we default under the 2024 Credit Agreement, the outstanding borrowings thereunder could become immediately due and\npayable, the 2024 Credit Facility lenders could refuse to permit additional borrowings under the facility, or it could lead to defaults under agreements governing\nour current or future indebtedness, including the indenture governing the 2027 Notes. If we default under the 2027 Notes, the 2027 Notes could become\nimmediately due and payable and it could lead to defaults under the 2024 Credit Agreement.\n*In addition, our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time.\nOur outstanding indebtedness consists of the 2027 Notes, which, if not converted, will be required to be repaid in cash at maturity in May 2027. While\nwe could seek to obtain additional third-party financing to pay for any amounts due in cash upon maturity of the 2027 Notes, we cannot be sure that such third-\nparty financing will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, we also may borrow up to $600.0 million in revolving loans under the\n2024 Credit Facility, which would be required to be repaid in cash at maturity in August 2029.\nManufacturing Risks\nIf we fail to comply with manufacturing regulations, our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nPrior to commercialization of our products, regulatory authorities must approve marketing applications that identify authorized manufacturing facilities\noperated by us or our contract manufacturers that are in compliance with cGMP requirements. In addition, our pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are\ncontinuously subject to scheduled and unannounced regulatory inspections by the FDA, and other comparable EU and other national and international\nregulatory authorities, before and after product approval, to monitor and ensure compliance with cGMP and other regulations. Our manufacturing facilities in the\nU.S. are licensed for the manufacture of PALYNZIQ, ROCTAVIAN, ALDURAZYME, BRINEURA, NAGLAZYME, VIMIZIM, and VOXZOGO. Our manufacturing\nfacility in Shanbally, Cork, Ireland is licensed for the manufacture of VIMIZIM and BRINEURA and packaging operations for VOXZOGO and PALYNZIQ. In\naddition, our third-party manufacturers’ facilities involved with the manufacture of our\n44\nTable of Contents\nproducts have also been inspected and approved by various regulatory authorities. Although we are not involved in the day-to-day operations of our contract\nmanufacturers, we are ultimately responsible for ensuring that our products are manufactured in accordance with cGMP regulations.\nDue to the complexity of the processes used to manufacture our products and product candidates, we may be unable to continue to pass or initially\npass federal, national or international regulatory inspections in a cost-effective manner. For the same reason, any potential third-party manufacturer of our\nproducts or our product candidates may be unable to comply with cGMP regulations in a cost-effective manner and may be unable to initially or continue to pass\na federal, national or international regulatory inspection.\nIf we, or third-party manufacturers with whom we contract, are unable to comply with manufacturing regulations, we may be subject to delay of approval\nof our product candidates, warning or untitled letters, fines, unanticipated compliance expenses, recall or seizure of our products, total or partial suspension of\nproduction and/or enforcement actions, including injunctions, and criminal or civil prosecution. These possible sanctions would adversely affect our financial\nresults and financial condition.\n*If we are unable to successfully develop and maintain manufacturing processes for our product candidates to produce sufficient quantities\nat acceptable costs, we may be unable to support a clinical trial or be forced to terminate a program, or if we are unable to produce sufficient\nquantities of our products at acceptable costs, we may be unable to meet commercial demand, lose potential revenue, have reduced margins or be\nforced to terminate a program.\nDue to the complexity of manufacturing our product candidates and products, we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities. Our inability to\nproduce enough of our product candidate at acceptable costs may result in the delay or termination of development programs. With respect to our commercial\nportfolio, we may not be able to manufacture our products successfully with a commercially viable process or at a scale large enough to support their respective\ncommercial markets or at acceptable margins. For example, strong demand for VOXZOGO in certain markets outpaced our projections in recent quarters, and\nwe have previously faced challenges meeting demand despite sufficient materials. While supply constraints have eased and we expect to have the ability to\nmeet estimated demand and support ongoing clinical programs, we may face challenges meeting demand in the future, requiring us to postpone planned entry\ninto additional markets until VOXZOGO inventory levels increase or delay certain VOXZOGO development activities. As a result of such inventory constraints,\nwe have lost, and may in the future lose, potential VOXZOGO revenues that may never be recouped and our VOXZOGO development program could be\nadversely impacted.\nThe development of commercially viable manufacturing processes typically is very difficult to achieve and is often very expensive and may require\nextended periods of time. Changes in manufacturing processes (including manufacturing cell lines), equipment or facilities (including moving manufacturing from\none of our facilities to another one of our facilities or a third-party facility, or from a third-party facility to one of our facilities) may require us to complete clinical\ntrials to receive regulatory approval of any manufacturing modifications.\nOur gene therapy product and product candidates are based on relatively novel technology, which presents additional manufacturing risks in relation to\nour other, more traditional drug development programs. Gene therapy products are complex and have only in limited cases been manufactured at scales\nsufficient for pivotal trials and commercialization. Few pharmaceutical contract manufacturers specialize in gene therapy products and those that do are still\ndeveloping appropriate processes and facilities for large-scale production. We invested a considerable amount of capital building our own commercial gene\ntherapy manufacturing facility, which may be subject to significant impairment if our gene therapy programs are unsuccessful. As we develop, seek to optimize\nand operate the gene therapy manufacturing process, we will likely face technical and scientific challenges, considerable capital costs, and potential difficulty in\nrecruiting and hiring experienced, qualified personnel. There may also be unexpected technical or operational issues during clinical or commercial manufacturing\ncampaigns. As a result, we could experience manufacturing delays that prevent us from completing our gene therapy clinical studies in a timely manner, if at all,\nor commercializing our gene therapy products on a profitable basis, if at all.\nAlso, we may be required to demonstrate product comparability between a biological product made after a manufacturing change and the product made\nbefore implementation of the change through additional types of analytical and functional testing or may have to complete additional clinical studies. If we\ncontract for manufacturing services with an unproven process, our contractor is subject to the same uncertainties, high standards and regulatory controls, and\nmay therefore experience difficulty if further process development is necessary.\nEven a developed manufacturing process can encounter difficulties. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including human\nerror, mechanical breakdowns, problems with raw materials and cell banks, malfunctions of internal information technology systems, and other events that\ncannot always be prevented or anticipated. Many of the processes include biological systems, which add significant complexity, as compared to chemical\nsynthesis. We expect that, from time to time, consistent with biotechnology industry expectations, certain production lots will fail to produce product that meets\nour quality control release acceptance criteria. To date, our historical failure rates for all of our product programs have been within our expectations, which are\nbased on industry norms. If the failure rate increased substantially, we could experience increased costs, lost revenue,\n45\nTable of Contents\ndamage to customer relations, time and expense investigating the cause and, depending upon the cause, similar losses with respect to other lots or products. If\nproblems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred.\nIn order to produce product within our time and cost parameters, we must continue to produce product within our expected success rate and yield\nexpectations. Because of the complexity of our manufacturing processes, it may be difficult or impossible for us to determine the cause of any particular lot\nfailure and we must effectively take corrective action in response to any failure in a timely manner.\nWe currently rely on third parties for portions of the manufacture of each of our products. If those manufacturers are unwilling or unable to fulfill their\ncontractual obligations or satisfy demand outside of or in excess of the contractual obligations, we may be unable to meet demand for these products or sell\nthese products at all and we may lose potential revenue. Further, the availability of suitable contract manufacturing capacity at scheduled or optimum times is not\ncertain.\nIn addition, our manufacturing processes subject us to a variety of federal, state, supranational, national, and local laws and regulations governing the\nuse, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes resulting from their use. We incur significant costs in complying\nwith these laws and regulations.\nSupply interruptions may disrupt our inventory levels and the availability of our products and product candidates and cause delays in\nobtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, or harm our business by reducing our revenues.\nWe depend on single-source suppliers for critical raw materials and a limited number of manufacturing facilities to manufacture our finished products\nand product candidates. Numerous factors could cause interruptions in the supply or manufacture of our products and product candidates, including:\n• timing, scheduling and prioritization of production by our contract manufacturers or a breach of our agreements by our contract manufacturers;\n• labor interruptions;\n• changes in our sources for manufacturing;\n• the timing and delivery of shipments;\n• our failure to locate and obtain replacement suppliers and manufacturers as needed on a timely basis; and\n• conditions affecting the cost and availability of raw materials, including inflation.\nIf one of our suppliers or manufacturers fails or refuses to supply us with necessary raw materials or finished products or product candidates on a timely\nbasis or at all, it would take a significant amount of time and expense to qualify a new supplier or manufacturer. We may not be able to obtain active ingredients\nor finished products from new suppliers or manufacturers on acceptable terms and at reasonable prices, or at all.\nAny interruption in the supply of finished products could hinder our ability to distribute finished products to meet commercial demand and adversely\naffect our financial results and financial condition.\nWith respect to our product candidates, production of product is necessary to perform clinical trials and successful registration batches are necessary to\nfile for approval to commercially market and sell product candidates. Delays in obtaining clinical material or registration batches could adversely impact our\nclinical trials and delay regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nIf our Manufacturing, Marketing and Sales Agreement with Sanofi were terminated, we could be prevented from continuing to commercialize\nALDURAZYME or our ability to successfully commercialize ALDURAZYME would be delayed or diminished.\nEither party may terminate the Manufacturing, Marketing and Sales Agreement (the MMS Agreement) between Sanofi and us related to ALDURAZYME\nfor specified reasons, including if the other party is in material breach of the MMS Agreement, has experienced a change of control, as such term is defined in\nthe MMS Agreement, or has declared bankruptcy and also is in breach of the MMS Agreement. Although we are not currently in breach of the MMS Agreement,\nthere is a risk that either party could breach the MMS Agreement in the future. Either party may also terminate the MMS Agreement upon one-year prior written\nnotice for any reason.\nIf the MMS Agreement is terminated for breach, the breaching party will transfer its interest in the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC to the non-breaching party,\nand the non-breaching party will pay a specified buyout amount for the breaching party’s interest in\n46\nTable of Contents\nALDURAZYME and in the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC. If we are the breaching party, we would lose our rights to ALDURAZYME and the related intellectual property\nand regulatory approvals. If the MMS Agreement is terminated without cause, the non-terminating party would have the option, exercisable for one year, to buy\nout the terminating party’s interest in ALDURAZYME and in the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC at a specified buyout amount. If such option is not exercised, all rights to\nALDURAZYME will be sold and the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC will be dissolved. In the event of termination of the buyout option without exercise by the non-\nterminating party as described above, all right and title to ALDURAZYME is to be sold to the highest bidder, with the proceeds to be split between Sanofi and us\nin accordance with our percentage interest in the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC.\nIf the MMS Agreement is terminated by either party because the other party declared bankruptcy, the terminating party would be obligated to buy out\nthe other party and would obtain all rights to ALDURAZYME exclusively. If the MMS Agreement is terminated by a party because the other party experienced a\nchange of control, the terminating party shall notify the other party, the offeree, of its intent to buy out the offeree’s interest in ALDURAZYME and the\nBioMarin/Genzyme LLC for a stated amount set by the terminating party at its discretion. The offeree must then either accept this offer or agree to buy the\nterminating party’s interest in ALDURAZYME and the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC on those same terms. The party who buys out the other party would then have\nexclusive worldwide rights to ALDURAZYME. The Amended and Restated Collaboration Agreement between us and Sanofi will automatically terminate upon the\neffective date of the termination of the MMS Agreement and may not be terminated independently from the MMS Agreement.\nIf we were obligated or given the option to buy out Sanofi’s interest in ALDURAZYME and the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC, and thereby gain exclusive\nrights to ALDURAZYME, we may not have sufficient funds to do so and we may not be able to obtain the financing to do so. If we fail to buy out Sanofi’s interest,\nwe may be held in breach of the agreement and may lose any claim to the rights to ALDURAZYME and the related intellectual property and regulatory\napprovals. We would then effectively be prohibited from developing and commercializing ALDURAZYME. If this happened, not only would our product revenues\ndecrease, but our share price would also decline.\nRisks Related to International Operations\n*We conduct a significant amount of our operations and generate a significant percentage of our sales outside of the U.S., which subjects us\nto additional business risks that could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nA significant portion of the sales of our products are generated from countries other than the U.S., and we expect international markets will continue to\nbe important for the sales of any products approved in the future. We have operations in Canada and in several European, Middle Eastern, Asian, and Latin\nAmerican countries. We expect that we will continue to expand our international operations in the future. International operations inherently subject us to a\nnumber of risks and uncertainties, including:\n• the increased complexity and costs inherent in managing international operations;\n• diverse regulatory and compliance requirements, and changes in those requirements that could restrict our ability to manufacture, market and sell\nour products;\n• geopolitical and economic instability, such as the instability caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the conflicts in the Middle East;\n• diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the U.S.;\n• trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n• difficulty in staffing and managing international operations;\n• differing labor regulations and business practices;\n• potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n• changes in international medical reimbursement policies and programs;\n• financial risks such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable, exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates\nand potential currency controls imposed by non-U.S. governments;\n• regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distributors’ and service providers’\nactivities that may fall within the purview of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA); and\n• rapidly evolving global laws and regulations relating to data protection and the privacy and security of commercial and personal information.\nAny of these factors may, individually or as a group, have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For example, Russia’s\ninvasion of Ukraine and the related impacts to Ukraine’s infrastructure and healthcare system has significantly impacted our ability to provide our therapies to\npatients in Ukraine. Sanctions issued by the U.S. and other\n47\nTable of Contents\ncountries against Russia and Belarus in response to the attack on Ukraine and related counter-sanctions issued by Russia have made it very difficult for us to\noperate in Russia and may have a material adverse impact on our ability to sell our products and/or collect receivables from customers in Russia and Belarus.\nAs we continue to expand our existing international operations, we may encounter new risks. For example, as we focus on building our international\nsales and distribution networks in new geographic regions, we must continue to develop relationships with qualified local distributors and trading companies. If\nwe are not successful in developing and maintaining these relationships, we may not be able to grow sales in these geographic regions. These or other similar\nrisks could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nA significant portion of our international sales are made based on special access programs, and changes to these programs could adversely\naffect our product sales and revenues in these countries.\nWe make a significant portion of our initial international sales of newly launched products through early access, special access or “named patient sales”\nprograms in markets where we are not required to obtain regulatory approval before establishing these programs. For example, a significant portion of our\ninternational sales of VOXZOGO since the product’s launch have been made through such programs. The specifics of the programs vary from country to\ncountry. Generally, special approval must be obtained to initiate such programs, and in some cases, special approval must be obtained for each patient. The\napproval normally requires an application to national competent authorities in which the product is intended to be supplied or a lawsuit accompanied by evidence\nof medical need.\nThese programs are not well defined in some countries and are subject to changes in requirements, funding levels, unmet medical need and\nclassification of the disease treated by our product. Any change to these programs could adversely affect our ability to sell our products in those countries and\ndelay sales. If the programs are not funded by the respective government, there could be insufficient funds to pay for all patients. Further, governments have and\nmay continue to undertake unofficial measures to limit purchases of our products, including initially denying coverage for purchasers, delaying orders, requiring\nadditional in-country testing and denying or taking excessively long to approve customs clearance. Any such actions could materially delay or reduce our\nrevenues from such countries.\nWithout the special access programs, we would need to seek full product approval or official reimbursement to commercially market and sell our\nproducts in certain jurisdictions. This can be an expensive and time-consuming process and may subject our products to additional price controls. Because the\nnumber of patients is so small in some countries, it may not be economically feasible to seek, obtain and maintain a full product approval or official\nreimbursement, and therefore the sales in such country would be permanently reduced or eliminated. For all of these reasons, if the special access programs\nthat we are currently using are eliminated or restricted, our revenues could be adversely affected.\nOur international operations pose currency risks, which may adversely affect our operating results and net income.\nA significant and growing portion of our revenues and earnings, as well as our substantial international assets and liabilities, are exposed to changes in\nforeign exchange rates. As we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the Euro, the Brazilian Real, the Russian Ruble, the Colombian Peso, the\nArgentine Peso and several other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar (USD) will impact our revenues and expenses. If the USD\nwere to weaken against another currency, assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would increase, having a positive impact on earnings,\nand our overall expenses would increase, having a negative impact on earnings. Conversely, if the USD were to strengthen against another currency (as was the\ncase for many currencies in 2022), assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would decrease, having a negative impact on earnings, and\nour overall expenses would decrease, having a positive impact on earnings. In addition, because our financial statements are reported in USD, changes in\ncurrency exchange rates between the USD and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. Therefore,\nsignificant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance.\nWe implement currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates. However, our hedging\nstrategies may not be successful, and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue to be subject to market fluctuations. These risks could\ncause a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nU.S. export control and economic sanctions may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Moreover,\ncompliance with such regulatory requirements may increase our costs and negatively impact our ability to sell our products and collect cash from\ncustomers.\nOur products are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and various economic and\ntrade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Exports of our products and solutions\nmust be made in compliance with these laws and regulations. Changes to\n48\nTable of Contents\nthese laws and regulations, or to the countries, governments, persons or activities targeted by such laws, could result in decreased use of our products, or\nhinder our ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers, which would likely adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition\nor strategic objectives. For example, sanctions issued by the U.S. and other jurisdictions against Russia and Belarus in response to the invasion of Ukraine have\nmade it very difficult for us to operate in Russia and may have a material adverse impact on our ability to sell our products and/or collect receivables from\ncustomers in Russia and Belarus. Moreover, if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties,\nincluding the possible loss of export or import privileges and fines.\nWe rely on a general license from OFAC to sell our medicines for eventual use by hospital and clinic end-users in Iran. The use of this OFAC general\nlicense requires us to observe strict conditions with respect to products sold, end-user limitations and payment requirements. Although we believe we have\nmaintained compliance with the general license requirements, there can be no assurance that the general license will not be revoked, the general license will be\nrenewed in the future or we will remain in compliance with the general license. A violation of the OFAC general license could result in substantial fines, sanctions,\ncivil or criminal penalties, competitive or reputational harm, litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely affect our results of\noperations, financial condition or strategic objectives.\nMoreover, U.S. export control and economic sanctions may make operating in certain countries more difficult and expensive. For example, we may be\nunable to find distributors or financial institutions willing to facilitate the sale of our products and collection of cash from such sales in a cost-effective manner, if at\nall.\nFailure to comply with applicable anti-corruption legislation could result in fines, criminal penalties and materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to comply with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the FCPA in the U.S. and other\nsimilar laws in other countries in which we do business. We operate in a number of countries that are recognized to have a reputation for corruption and pose an\nincreased risk of corrupt practices. We also regularly interact with government regulators in many countries, including those that are considered higher risk for\ncorruption, in order to secure regulatory approval to manufacture and distribute our products. The anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws to which we are subject\ngenerally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. government officials or other persons for the purposes of\ninfluencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business and/or other benefits. These laws also require us to make and keep books and records that\naccurately and fairly reflect our transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. As part of our business, we deal\nwith state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered non-U.S. government officials for purposes of applicable\nanti-corruption laws.\nAlthough we have adopted policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees and third-party agents will comply with such laws, there\ncan be no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively at all times or protect us against liability under these or other laws for actions taken by\nour employees, partners and other third parties with respect to our business. If we are not in compliance with anti-corruption laws and other laws governing the\nconduct of business with government entities and/or officials (including local laws), we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial\nmeasures, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Investigations of any actual or alleged violations\nof such laws or policies related to us could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nMoreover, there has been enhanced scrutiny of company-sponsored patient assistance programs, including insurance premium and co-pay assistance\nprograms and donations to third-party independent charities that provide such assistance. There has also been enhanced scrutiny by governments on\nreimbursement support offerings, clinical education programs and promotional speaker programs. If we, our third-party agents or donation recipients are deemed\nto have failed to comply with laws, regulations or government guidance in any of these areas, we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions. Any similar\nviolations by our competitors could also negatively impact our industry reputation and increase scrutiny over our business and our products.\nWe face credit risks from government-owned or sponsored customers outside of the U.S. that may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur product sales to government-owned or supported customers in various countries outside of the U.S. are subject to significant payment delays due\nto government funding and reimbursement practices. This has resulted and may continue to result in an increase in days sales outstanding due to the average\nlength of time that we have accounts receivable outstanding. If significant changes were to occur in the reimbursement practices of these governments or if\ngovernment funding becomes unavailable, we may not be able to collect on amounts due to us from these customers and our results of operations would be\nadversely affected.\nIntellectual Property Risks\n49\nTable of Contents\n*If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may not be able to compete effectively or preserve our market shares.\nWhere appropriate, we seek patent protection for certain aspects of our technology. Patent protection may not be available for some of the products we\nare developing. If we must spend significant time and money protecting or enforcing our patents, designing around patents held by others or licensing, potentially\nfor large fees, patents or other proprietary rights held by others, our business and financial prospects may be harmed.\nThe patent positions of biopharmaceutical products are complex and uncertain. The scope and extent of patent protection for some of our products and\nproduct candidates are particularly uncertain because key information on some of our product candidates has existed in the public domain for many years. The\ncomposition and genetic sequences of animal and/or human versions of ALDURAZYME, NAGLAZYME and many of our product candidates have been\npublished and are believed to be in the public domain. The chemical structure of 6R-BH4 (the active ingredient in KUVAN) has also been published. Publication\nof this information may prevent us from obtaining or enforcing patents relating to our products and product candidates, including without limitation composition-\nof-matter patents, which are generally believed to offer the strongest patent protection.\nWe own or have licensed patents and patent applications related to our products. However, these patents and patent applications do not ensure the\nprotection of our intellectual property for a number of reasons, including without limitation the following:\n• With respect to pending patent applications, unless and until actually issued, the protective value of these applications is impossible to determine.\nWe do not know whether our patent applications will result in issued patents.\n• Patents have limited duration and expire.\n• Enforcing patents is expensive and may absorb significant time of our management. Management would spend less time and resources on\ndeveloping products, which could increase our operating expenses and delay product programs.\n• Receipt of a patent may not provide much, if any, practical protection. For example, if we receive a patent with a narrow scope, then it will be easier\nfor competitors to design products that do not infringe on our patent.\n• The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011, which reformed certain patent laws in the U.S., may create additional uncertainty. Among the\nsignificant changes are switching from a “first-to-invent” system to a “first-to-file” system, and the implementation of new procedures that permit\ncompetitors to challenge our patents in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office after grant.\nOur current and former employees, consultants or contractors may unintentionally or willfully disclose trade secrets to competitors. Enforcing a claim\nthat someone else illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets, as with patent litigation, is expensive and time consuming, requires significant resources and\nhas an unpredictable outcome. In addition, courts outside of the U.S. are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Furthermore, our competitors may\nindependently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, in which case we would not be able to enforce our trade secret rights against such\ncompetitors.\nIn the EU, materials we submit to the EMA in connection with our clinical trials that were traditionally regarded as confidential, proprietary information,\nsuch as study protocols, information regarding manufacturing methods and controls, and intermediate data analyses, are now subject to public disclosure.\nMoreover, clinical trial data submitted to the EMA in our MAAs are also available to the public. We are only permitted to redact from public disclosures\ncommercially confidential information, a standard which is construed narrowly and subject to the interpretation and final decision of the EU regulatory authorities.\nEU regulations have resulted and will continue to result in the EMA’s public disclosure of certain of our proprietary information related to recently completed and\nfuture clinical trials and MAA submissions. The move toward public disclosure of such development information could adversely affect our business in many\nways, including, for example, resulting in the disclosure of our confidential methodologies for development of our products, preventing us from obtaining\nintellectual property right protection for innovations, requiring us to allocate significant resources to prevent other companies from violating our intellectual\nproperty rights, adding even more complexity to processing health data from clinical trials consistent with applicable data privacy regulations, increasing scrutiny\nof our product candidates and products, and enabling competitors to use our clinical trial information and data to gain approvals for their own products.\nCompetitors or other third parties may interfere with our patent process in a variety of ways. Competitors or other third parties may claim that they\ninvented the claimed invention prior to us or that they filed their application for a patent on a claimed invention before we did. Competitors or other third parties\nmay also claim that we are infringing on their patents and therefore we cannot practice our technology. Competitors or other third parties may also contest our\npatents by showing the patent examiner or a court that the invention was not original, was not novel or was obvious, for example. In litigation, any such party\ncould claim that our issued patents are not valid or are unenforceable for a number of reasons. If a court agrees, we would not be able to enforce that patent.\nMoreover, follow-on manufacturers, including generic and biosimilar manufacturers, may use litigation and regulatory\n50\nTable of Contents\nmeans to obtain approval for generic, biosimilar, or other follow-on versions of our products notwithstanding our filed patents or patent applications.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, third parties could develop competing products, which could adversely affect our revenues and\nfinancial results generally.\n*Competitors and other third parties may have developed intellectual property that could limit our ability to market and commercialize our\nproducts and product candidates, if approved.\nSimilar to us, competitors and other third parties continually seek intellectual property protection for their technology. Several of our products, such as\nROCTAVIAN, and development programs, focus on therapeutic areas that have been the subject of extensive research and development by third parties for\nmany years. Due to the amount of intellectual property in our field of technology, we cannot be certain that we do not infringe intellectual property rights of\ncompetitors or other third parties or that we will not infringe intellectual property rights of competitors or other third parties granted or created in the future. For\nexample, if a patent holder believes our product infringes its patent, the patent holder may sue us even if we have received patent protection for our technology.\nIf someone else claims we infringe their intellectual property, we would face a number of issues, including the following:\n• Defending a lawsuit takes significant executive resources and can be very expensive.\n• If a court decides that our product infringes a competitor’s intellectual property, we may have to pay substantial damages.\n• With respect to patents, in addition to requiring us to pay substantial damages, a court may prohibit us from making, selling, offering to sell,\nimporting or using our product unless the patent holder licenses the patent to us. The patent holder is not required to grant us a license. If a license\nis available, it may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. For example, we may have to pay substantial royalties or grant cross\nlicenses to our patents and patent applications.\n• We may need to redesign our product so it does not infringe the intellectual property rights of others.\n• Redesigning our product so it does not infringe the intellectual property rights of others may not be possible or could require substantial funds and\ntime.\nWe may also support and collaborate in research conducted by government organizations, hospitals, universities or other educational institutions.\nThese research partners may be unwilling to grant us any exclusive rights to technology or products derived from these collaborations. For example, under the\nBayh-Dole Act which only applies to patents for inventions generated from federally funded research, the U.S. Department of Commerce may allow the\ngovernment to use “march-in” rights for prescription drug patents as a means to control prices.\nIf we do not obtain required licenses or rights, we could encounter delays in our product development efforts while we attempt to design around other\npatents or may be prohibited from making, using, importing, offering to sell or selling products requiring these licenses or rights. There is also a risk that disputes\nmay arise as to the rights to technology or products developed in collaboration with other parties. If we are not able to resolve such disputes and obtain the\nlicenses or rights we need, we may not be able to develop or market our products.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\n*Our stock price has been and may in the future be volatile, and an investment in our stock could suffer a decline in value.\nOur stock price has been and may in the future be volatile. Our valuation and stock price may have no meaningful relationship to current or historical\nearnings, asset values, book value or many other criteria based on conventional measures of stock value. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated,\nand in the future could fluctuate, due to factors including:\n• product sales and profitability of our products;\n• manufacturing, supply or distribution of our product candidates and products;\n• progress of our product candidates through the regulatory process and our ability to successfully commercialize any such products that receive\nregulatory approval;\n• results of clinical trials, announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n• generic competition to KUVAN tablets and powder described above in this Risk Factors section or potential generic competition from future\ncompetitors;\n51\nTable of Contents\n• government regulatory action affecting our product candidates, our products or our competitors’ product candidates and products in both the U.S.\nand non-U.S. countries;\n• developments or disputes concerning patent or proprietary rights;\n• general market conditions and fluctuations for the emerging growth and pharmaceutical market sectors;\n• economic conditions in the U.S. or abroad;\n• negative publicity about us or the pharmaceutical industry;\n• changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n• cybersecurity incidents experienced by us or others in our industry;\n• broad market fluctuations in the U.S., the EU or in other parts of the world;\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results, including due to timing of large periodic orders for our products by governments in certain\ncountries;\n• changes in company assessments or financial estimates by securities analysts;\n• certain actions by activist investors that may be threatened or commenced against us;\n• acquisitions of products, businesses, or other assets;\n• industry, financial analyst, or investor reaction to our public announcements; and\n• sales of our shares of stock by us, our significant stockholders, or members of our management or Board of Directors.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market\nprices of equity securities of many companies. In some cases, these fluctuations have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those\ncompanies. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. For\nexample, in September 2020, after a substantial drop in our stock price that followed an announcement providing a regulatory update regarding ROCTAVIAN, we\nand certain of our officers were sued in a putative class action lawsuit alleging violations of the federal securities laws for allegedly making materially false or\nmisleading statements. In addition, in October 2021, after a drop in our stock price that followed an announcement providing a regulatory update regarding BMN\n307, we and certain of our current and former officers were sued in a putative class action lawsuit alleging violations of the federal securities laws for allegedly\nmaking materially false or misleading statements. We may be the target of additional litigation of this type in the future as well. Securities litigation against us\ncould result in substantial costs and divert our management’s time and attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business.\nIn addition, our stock price can be materially adversely affected by factors beyond our control, such as disruptions in global financial markets or\nnegative trends in the biotechnology sector of the economy, even if our business is operating well.\n*Conversion of the 2027 Notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted\ntheir 2027 Notes, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the 2027 Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the\ncommon stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2027 Notes\nmay encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 2027 Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion\nof the 2027 Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\n*The fundamental change repurchase feature of the 2027 Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take us over.\nThe terms of the 2027 Notes require us to offer to repurchase the 2027 Notes in the event of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture\ngoverning the 2027 Notes). A takeover of us would trigger options by the respective holders of the 2027 Notes to require us to repurchase such 2027 Notes. This\nmay have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of us that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders or investors in the 2027 Notes.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law may make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our\nstockholders, more difficult.\nWe are incorporated in Delaware. Certain anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and our charter documents as currently in effect may make a\nchange in control of us more difficult, even if a change in control would be beneficial to the stockholders. Our anti-takeover provisions include provisions in our\nrestated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated\n52\nTable of Contents\nbylaws providing that stockholders’ meetings may only be called by our Chairman, the lead independent director or the majority of our Board of Directors and\nthat the stockholders may not take action by written consent and requiring that stockholders that desire to nominate any person for election to our Board of\nDirectors or to make any proposal with respect to business to be conducted at a meeting of our stockholders be submitted in appropriate form to our Secretary\nwithin a specified period of time in advance of any such meeting. Additionally, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock and to\ndetermine the terms of those shares of stock without any further action by our stockholders. The rights of holders of our common stock are subject to the rights\nof the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued. The issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our\noutstanding voting stock. Delaware law also prohibits corporations from engaging in a business combination with any holders of 15% or more of their capital\nstock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless, among other possibilities, our Board of Directors approves the transaction. Our Board of\nDirectors may use these provisions to prevent changes in the management and control of us. Also, under applicable Delaware law, our Board of Directors may\nadopt additional anti-takeover measures in the future.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the U.S. as the\nexclusive forums for the adjudication of certain disputes, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes\nwith us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of\nactions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\n• any derivative claim or cause of action brought on our behalf;\n• any claim or cause of action for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of BioMarin to us or our\nstockholders;\n• any claim or cause of action against us or any of our current or former directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the\nGeneral Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, our restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; any claim or\ncause of action seeking to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated\nbylaws;\n• any claim or cause of action as to which the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the\nState of Delaware; and\n• any claim or cause of action against us or any of our current or former directors, officers or other employees that is governed by the internal affairs\ndoctrine.\nThis exclusive-forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the\nExchange Act or any other claim for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that the\nfederal district courts of the U.S. of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.\nWhile the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a\nclaim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and\nenforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated bylaws. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such\naction in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions.\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our\ndirectors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If a court were to find either of\nour exclusive forum provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving the\ndispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could seriously harm our business. Our amended and restated bylaws further provide that any person or entity that\nacquires any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of such provisions.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n*We depend upon our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.\nOur future growth and success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract, retain, manage and motivate our employees. The loss of the\nservices of a significant portion of our workforce or any member of our senior management or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel could adversely\naffect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results.\nBecause of the specialized nature of our business, we rely heavily on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and managerial\npersonnel. In particular, the loss of one or more of our senior executive officers could be detrimental to us\n53\nTable of Contents\nif we do not have an adequate succession plan or if we cannot recruit suitable replacements in a timely manner. While our senior executive officers are parties to\nemployment agreements with us, these agreements do not guarantee that they will remain employed with us in the future. In addition, in many cases, these\nagreements do not restrict our senior executive officers’ ability to compete with us after their employment is terminated. We have experienced changes to our\nmanagement team starting with the appointment of Alexander Hardy as our new President and Chief Executive Officer in December 2023. Since then, Cristin\nHubbard was appointed as our new Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer in May 2024, Dr. Greg Friberg was appointed as our new Executive\nVice President and Chief Research & Development Officer in September 2024, and Dr. James Sabry was appointed as our new Executive Vice President and\nChief Business Officer in October 2024. The recent changes in our management team could cause retention and morale concerns among current employees,\nand may create operational risks.\nThe competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field is intense, and there is a limited pool of qualified potential employees to recruit.\nRecently, like many other employers in the U.S., we experienced increased employee turnover. Due to the intense competition for talent, we may be unable to\ncontinue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to recruit suitable replacement personnel. Additionally, we\ncannot be sure that the compensation costs of doing so will not adversely affect our operating results, and we may not be able to hire and train employees\nquickly enough to meet our needs. Moreover, during the second and third quarters of 2024, we announced reductions in our global workforce by an aggregate of\napproximately 395 employees. As a result, we could face employee attrition beyond our intended reductions in force and adverse effects on employee morale,\ndiversion of management attention, and adverse effects to our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficult for us to hire employees in the\nfuture. If we fail to retain employees and effectively manage our hiring needs, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts, employee morale, productivity, and the\nsuccess of our strategic plans could suffer, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n*Our success depends on our ability to manage our growth.\nVOXZOGO addresses larger patient populations than most of our other products, and product candidates that we are currently developing or may\nlicense or acquire in the future may be intended for similarly larger patient populations than we have historically targeted. In order to continue development of\nsuch product candidates and marketing of products with larger markets, we will need to continue expanding our operations. To manage expansion effectively, we\nneed to continue to develop and improve our research and development capabilities, manufacturing and quality capacities, sales and marketing capabilities,\nfinancial and administrative systems and standard processes for global operations. For example, strong demand for VOXZOGO in certain markets outpaced our\nprojections in recent quarters, and we have previously faced challenges meeting demand despite sufficient materials. While supply constraints have eased and\nwe expect to have the ability to meet estimated demand and support ongoing clinical programs, we may face challenges meeting demand in the future. Our staff,\nfinancial resources, systems, procedures or controls may be inadequate to support our operations and may increase our exposure to regulatory, competitive,\nand corruption risks and our management may be unable to manage successfully current or future market opportunities or our relationships with customers and\nother third parties.\nIn addition, there is no guarantee that our research and development prioritization activities, including the acceleration or discontinuation of certain\nprograms, will generate their expected benefits and the costs associated with such activities may be greater than anticipated. Such activities may also adversely\naffect our internal programs and initiatives as well as our ability to recruit and retain skilled and motivated personnel. If we are unable to execute on our business\nplan or realize the expected benefits of our research and development prioritization activities, then our operating results and financial condition may be materially\nand adversely affected.\nNew tax laws or regulations that are enacted or existing tax laws and regulations that are interpreted, modified or applied adversely to us or\nour customers may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nNew tax laws or regulations could be enacted at any time, and existing tax laws or regulations could be interpreted, modified or applied in a manner that\nis adverse to us or our customers, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Coronavirus\nAid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and the Inflation Reduction Act enacted many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws. Future guidance from the Internal\nRevenue Service and other tax authorities with respect to such legislation may affect us, and certain aspects of such legislation could be repealed or modified in\nfuture legislation. Among other changes, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act amended the Code to require that, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, certain\nresearch and experimental expenditures be capitalized and amortized over five years if incurred in the United States or fifteen years if incurred in foreign\njurisdictions. Although the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would defer, modify, or repeal the capitalization and amortization requirement, there is\nno assurance that such changes will be made. If the requirement is not deferred, repealed or otherwise modified, it may increase our cash tax. In addition, it is\nuncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to federal tax laws. Any future tax legislation could increase our U.S. tax expense and could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nMoreover, changes in the tax laws of jurisdictions in which we conduct business could arise, including as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting\n(BEPS) project that is being led by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and other initiatives led by the OECD or the EC. For\nexample, the OECD, which represents a coalition of member\n54\nTable of Contents\ncountries including the U.S. and other countries in which we have operations, is working on proposals, commonly referred to as “BEPS 2.0”, which, if and to the\nextent implemented, would make important changes to the international tax system. These proposals are based on two “pillars”, Pillar One focuses on the\nallocation of taxing rights in respect of certain profits of multinational enterprises with annual global revenue above 20 billion euros and profitability above 10% to\nthe jurisdictions within which they carry on business (based on the thresholds, we currently expect to be outside the scope of the Pillar One proposals, but could\nfall within their scope in the future) and Pillar Two imposes a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on certain multinational enterprises that have consolidated\nrevenues of at least 750 million euros in at least two out of the last four years (based on the thresholds, we currently expect that we are likely to fall within the\nscope of the Pillar Two proposals). A number of countries in which we conduct business have enacted with effect from January 1, 2024, or are in the process of\nenacting, core elements of Pillar Two rules. The OECD has issued administrative guidance providing transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation\nof Pillar Two. We are monitoring developments and evaluating the impacts these new rules will have on our tax rate, including eligibility to qualify for these safe\nharbor rules. It is not uncommon for taxing authorities in different countries to have conflicting views, for instance, with respect to, among other things, the\nmanner in which the arm’s length standard is applied for transfer pricing purposes, or with respect to the valuation of intellectual property. If tax authorities\nsuccessfully challenge our transfer prices as not reflecting arm’s length transactions, they could require us to adjust our transfer prices and thereby reallocate\nour income to reflect these revised transfer prices, resulting in a higher tax liability. In addition, if a country from which income is reallocated does not agree with\nthe reallocation, both that country and the other country to which the income was allocated could tax the same income, potentially resulting in double taxation. If\ntax authorities were to allocate income to a higher tax jurisdiction, subject our income to double taxation or assess interest and penalties, it would increase our\nconsolidated tax liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are found in violation of healthcare laws or privacy and data protection laws, we may be required to pay penalties, be subjected to\nscrutiny by regulators or governmental entities, or be suspended from participation in government healthcare programs, which may adversely affect\nour business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various healthcare laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, including anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, data privacy\nand security laws, and laws related to ensuring compliance. In the U.S., the federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a\npharmaceutical company, to knowingly and willfully offer, solicit, pay or receive any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce the referral of\nbusiness, including the purchase, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as\nMedicare and Medicaid. Under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and related regulations, certain arrangements are deemed not to violate the federal Anti-\nKickback Statute if they fit within a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. However, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices\nthat involve remuneration not intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or\nsafe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from Anti-Kickback liability, although we seek to comply with\nthese safe harbors. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to referral of patients for healthcare\nservices reimbursed by any source, not just governmental payers. As previously disclosed, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice\nrequesting that we produce certain documents regarding our sponsored testing programs relating to VIMIZIM and NAGLAZYME. We have produced documents\nin response to the subpoena and are cooperating fully, but there is no assurance that such sponsored testing programs, or our other operations or programs, will\nnot be found to violate such laws.\nFederal and state false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act and the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, prohibit any person or entity from\nknowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false\nstatement to have a false claim paid, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an\nobligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws.\nUnder the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), we also are prohibited from, among other things, knowingly and willfully\nexecuting a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payers, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a\nmaterial fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or\nservices.\nIn addition, federal and state healthcare legislation have strengthened these laws in the U.S. For example, the PPACA, among other things, amends the\nintent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of\nthese statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to commit a violation. Moreover, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim\nincluding items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False\nClaims Act.\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes\nobligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on certain types of individuals and entities, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, integrity, availability,\nsecurity and transmission of individually identifiable health information.\n55\nTable of Contents\nMany state and non-U.S. laws also govern the privacy and security of health information. They often differ from each other in significant ways and often are not\npreempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. The global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and implementation standards and\nenforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. In the U.S., state privacy laws and regulations impose restrictive requirements\nregulating the use and disclosure of health information and other sensitive personal information that is not subject to HIPAA. For example, California enacted the\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California consumers expanded rights to access and delete\ntheir personal information, opt out of certain personal information sales, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA\nprovides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA was\nexpanded substantially on January 1, 2023 when the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CPRA) took effect and amended the CCPA. Following the CPRA\namendments, the CCPA, among other things, gives consumers the ability to limit use of information deemed to be sensitive, increase the maximum penalties for\nviolations concerning consumers under age 16, expands an individual’s private right of action and establishes the California Privacy Protection Agency to\nimplement and enforce the new law and impose administrative fines.\nOther U.S. states have recently adopted consumer data protection and privacy laws, and more U.S. states may do so in the future. This creates the\npotential for a patchwork of overlapping but different state laws and could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S.,\nwhich could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Many other states are considering\nproposed comprehensive data privacy legislation and all 50 states have passed some form of legislation relating to privacy or cybersecurity.\nAspects of the CCPA, CPRA and similar laws in other states and their interpretation and enforcement remain uncertain. The potential effects of these\nlaws are far-reaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply.\nComplying with these or other similar laws, regulations, amendments to or re-interpretations of existing laws and regulations, and contractual or other obligations\nrelating to privacy, data protection, data transfers, data localization, or information security may require us to make changes to our services to enable us or our\ncustomers to meet new legal requirements, incur substantial operational costs, modify our data practices and policies, and restrict our business operations. Any\nactual or perceived failure by us to comply with these laws, regulations, or other obligations may lead to significant fines, penalties, regulatory investigations,\nlawsuits, significant costs for remediation, damage to our reputation, or other liabilities.\nThe European Regulation 2016/679, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as well as EEA Member State legislations\nsupplementing such regulation, apply to the processing of personal data of individuals located in the EEA, including health-related information, by companies\nlocated in the EEA, or in certain circumstances, by companies located outside of the EEA. These laws impose strict obligations on the ability to collect, record,\nstore, disclose, use and transmit personal data, including health-related information. These include several requirements relating to (i) obtaining, in some\nsituations, the informed consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, (ii) the information provided to the individuals about how their personal\ninformation is used, (iii) ensuring the security and confidentiality of the personal data, (iv) the obligation to notify regulatory authorities and affected individuals of\npersonal data breaches, (v) extensive internal privacy governance obligations, and (vi) obligations to honor rights of individuals in relation to their personal data\n(for example, the right to access, correct and delete their data). Switzerland has adopted similar restrictions.\nThe GDPR and other European data protection laws generally restrict the transfer of personal information from Europe, including the EEA and\nSwitzerland, to the U.S. and most other countries unless the U.S. companies participate in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework in accordance with the EC's\nadequacy decision adopted on July 10, 2023, or have implemented specific safeguards to protect the transferred personal information. U.S. companies can join\nthe EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework by committing to comply with a detailed set of privacy obligations and U.S. companies that do not fall under the EU-U.S.\nData Privacy Framework must implement certain specific safeguards. One of the primary safeguards allowing U.S. companies to import personal information\nfrom the EEA has been the EC’s Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). However, the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) issued a decision that called into\nquestion whether the SCCs can lawfully be used for transfers of personal information from Europe to the United States or most other countries. After the\nmentioned CJEU judgment, new sets of SCCs were published on June 4, 2021. Most importantly, the use of SCCs does not any longer automatically ensure\ncompliance with the GDPR. Instead, companies remain required to conduct a data transfer impact assessment for each transfer, which adds a compliance\nburden.\nPotential pecuniary fines for noncompliance with the GDPR may be up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of annual global revenue. The GDPR has\nincreased our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and has increased our compliance costs. The EU regulations that make\ncertain materials we submit to the EMA in connection with our clinical trials subject to public disclosure have increased the risk that we may unintentionally\ndisclose personal information protected under the GDPR and thereby incur associated penalties and suffer reputational damage.\nIn addition to the U.S. and European countries, other countries in which we operate have also enacted data privacy laws or may do so in the future. For\nexample, Brazil’s General Data Protection Law (LGPD), which is modeled on the GDPR, took effect in 2020.\n56\nTable of Contents\nSubstantial new laws and regulations affecting compliance have also been adopted in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. countries, which may require us to\nmodify our business practices with healthcare practitioners. For example, in the U.S., the PPACA, through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, requires\ncertain drug, biologicals and medical supply manufacturers to collect and report to CMS information on payments or transfers of value to physicians (defined to\ninclude doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other health care professionals (such as physicians assistants and nurse practitioners),\nand teaching hospitals, as well as investment and ownership interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding\ncalendar year. In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased state regulation of payments made to physicians. Certain states and/or local jurisdictions\nmandate implementation of compliance programs, compliance with the Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical\nManufacturers and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals, the registration of\npharmaceutical sales representatives and/or the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians, marketing expenditures,\nand drug pricing. Likewise, in many non-U.S. countries there is an increasing focus on the relationship between drug companies and healthcare practitioners.\nRecently enacted non-U.S. legislation creates reporting obligations on payments, gifts and benefits made to these professionals. Outside the U.S., interactions\nbetween pharmaceutical companies and health care professionals are also governed by strict laws, such as national anti-bribery laws of European countries,\nnational sunshine rules, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct. The shifting regulatory environment\nand the need to implement systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the costs of\nmaintaining compliance and the possibility that we may violate one or more of the requirements and be subject to fines or sanctions.\nDue to the breadth of the healthcare and privacy and data protection laws described above, the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory\nexceptions and safe harbors and the increased focus by law enforcement authorities in enforcing such laws, our business activities could be subject to challenge\nunder one or more of such laws. If we are found in violation of one of these laws, we may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions,\nincluding damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, public reprimands, diminished profits and future earnings,\nadditional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-\ncompliance with these laws, curtailment of our operations, and debarment, suspension or exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, any\nof which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities.\nWe are exposed to the potential product liability risks inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of human pharmaceuticals. We currently\nmaintain insurance against product liability lawsuits for the commercial sale of our products and for the clinical trials of our product candidates. Pharmaceutical\ncompanies must balance the cost of insurance with the level of coverage based on estimates of potential liability. Historically, the potential liability associated\nwith product liability lawsuits for pharmaceutical products has been unpredictable. Although we believe that our current insurance is a reasonable estimate of our\npotential liability and represents a commercially reasonable balancing of the level of coverage as compared to the cost of the insurance, we may be subject to\nclaims in connection with our clinical trials and commercial use of our products and product candidates for which our insurance coverage may not be adequate\nand we may be unable to avoid significant liability if any product liability lawsuit is brought against us. If we are the subject of a successful product liability claim\nthat exceeds the limits of any insurance coverage we obtain, we may incur substantial charges that would adversely affect our earnings and require the\ncommitment of capital resources that might otherwise be available for the development and commercialization of our product programs.\nIn the EU, new rules on liability of defective products were proposed on September 28, 2022. If adopted, these rules will make it easier for patients to\nclaim damages for defective products, for example by alleviating their burden of proof.\n*We rely significantly on information technology systems and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology,\nincluding any cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively and have a material adverse effect on our business,\nreputation, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely significantly on our information technology systems, including enterprise resource planning (ERP), production management, and other\ninformation systems, to effectively manage and maintain our operations, inventory and internal reports, to manufacture and ship products to customers and to\ntimely invoice them. Any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that infrastructure or security lapse (whether intentional or inadvertent) of that technology, including\ncybersecurity incidents or attacks, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nWe are currently implementing a new global ERP system, which will replace existing operating and financial systems. The preparation and\nimplementation of a new ERP system has required, and will continue to require, significant investment of capital and human resources. Our results of operations\ncould be adversely affected if we continue to experience delays or cost overruns during the implementation process, or if the ERP system or associated process\nchanges do not give rise to the benefits that we expect. Potential failure or flaws in the new ERP system may pose risks to our ability to operate successfully and\nefficiently and\n57\nTable of Contents\nfailure to implement the appropriate internal controls with respect to the new ERP system may result in the system producing inaccurate or unreliable\ninformation. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design or implementation of the new ERP system or related internal controls, or in the performance of\nlegacy information technology systems, could result in potentially much higher costs than we had incurred and adversely affect our ability to effectively fulfill\ncontractual obligations, file related government reports in a timely manner, operate and manage our business or otherwise affect our controls environment. Any\nof these consequences could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, our technology systems, including our cloud technologies, continue to increase in multitude and complexity, making them potentially\nvulnerable to breakdown, cyberattack and other disruptions. Potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded\ntechnology systems or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations and expose us to\ngreater risk of security breaches. Cybersecurity incidents resulting in the failure of our enterprise resource planning system, production management or other\nsystems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security or other unauthorized access or unavailability of these systems or those\nof any third parties in our supply chain or on whom we otherwise depend, have occurred in the past and may affect our ability in the future to manage and\nmaintain our operations, inventory and internal reports, and result in delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations.\nAs part of our business, we collect, store, and transmit large amounts of confidential information, proprietary data, intellectual property, and personal\ndata. The information and data processed and stored in our technology systems, and those of our research collaborators, CROs, contract manufacturers,\nsuppliers, distributors, or other third parties on whom we depend on to operate our business, may be vulnerable to loss, damage, denial-of-service, unauthorized\naccess or misappropriation. Data security incidents may be the result of unauthorized or unintended activity (or lack of activity) by our employees, contractors, or\nothers with authorized access to our network or malware, hacking, business email compromise, phishing, ransomware or other cyberattacks directed by third\nparties. While we have implemented measures to protect our information and data stored in our technology systems and those of the third parties with whom we\nwork, our efforts may not be successful.\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience cybersecurity incidents, although to our knowledge we have not experienced any material\nincident or interruption to date. If such a significant event were to occur, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and commercial\noperations, including due to a loss, corruption or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets, personal data or other proprietary or sensitive information. Further,\nthese cybersecurity incidents can lead to the public disclosure of personal information (including sensitive personal information) of our employees, clinical trial\npatients and others and result in demands for ransom or other forms of blackmail. Such attacks, including phishing attacks and attempts to misappropriate or\ncompromise confidential or proprietary information or sabotage enterprise IT systems, are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups\nand individuals with a wide range of motives (including industrial espionage) and expertise, including by organized criminal groups, “hacktivists”, nation states\nand others. Moreover, the costs to us to investigate and mitigate cybersecurity incidents could be significant. For example, the loss of clinical trial data could\nresult in delays in our product development or regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Any security\nbreach that results in the unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal data may require us to notify individuals, governmental authorities, credit reporting\nagencies, or other parties pursuant to privacy and security laws and regulations or other obligations. Such a security compromise could harm our reputation,\nerode confidence in our information security measures, and lead to regulatory scrutiny. To the extent that any disruption or security breach resulted in a loss of,\nor damage to, our data or systems, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential, proprietary or personal information, we could be exposed to a risk of loss,\nenforcement measures, penalties, fines, indemnification claims, litigation and potential civil or criminal liability, which could materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nNot all our contracts contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are\nsufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data privacy and security obligations. We cannot be sure that our insurance coverage\nwill be adequate or sufficient to protect us from or to mitigate liabilities arising out of our privacy and security practices, that such coverage will continue to be\navailable on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that such coverage will pay future claims.\nFurther, the SEC has adopted new rules that require us to provide greater disclosures around proactive security protections that we employ and\nreactive issues (e.g., security incidents). Any such disclosures, including those under state data breach notification laws, can be costly, and the disclosures we\nmake to comply with, or the failure to comply with, such requirements could lead to adverse consequences.\nIf a natural disaster, terrorist or criminal activity or other unforeseen event caused significant damage to our facilities or those of our third-\nparty manufacturers and suppliers or significantly disrupted our operations or those of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers, we may be\nunable to meet demand for our products and lose potential revenue, have reduced margins, or be forced to terminate a program.\nThe occurrence of an earthquake or other catastrophic disaster could cause damage to our facility and equipment, or that of our third-party\nmanufacturers or single-source suppliers, which could materially impair the ability for us or our third-party\n58\nTable of Contents\nmanufacturers to manufacture our products and product candidates. Our Galli Drive facility, located in Novato, California, is currently our only manufacturing\nfacility for ALDURAZYME, NAGLAZYME, VOXZOGO and PALYNZIQ and is one of two manufacturing facilities for BRINEURA and VIMIZIM. Our gene therapy\nmanufacturing facility is also located in Novato, California, and it is currently our only manufacturing facility to support ongoing ROCTAVIAN clinical development\nactivities and commercial demand for ROCTAVIAN. These facilities are located in the San Francisco Bay Area near known earthquake fault zones and are\nvulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes. We, the third-party manufacturers with whom we contract and our single-source suppliers of raw materials,\nwhich include many of our critical raw materials, are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including fires, explosions, floods, and similar\nevents. If any disaster were to occur, or any terrorist or criminal activity caused significant damage to our facilities or the facilities of our third-party manufacturers\nand suppliers, our ability to manufacture our products, or to have our products manufactured, could be seriously, or potentially completely, impaired, and our\ncommercialization efforts and revenues could be seriously impaired.\nMoreover, other unforeseen events, such as power outages, could significantly disrupt our operations or those of our third-party manufacturers and\nsuppliers, which could result in damage to our facilities and significant delays in the manufacture of our products and adversely impact our commercial\noperations and revenues. The insurance that we carry, the inventory that we maintain and our risk mitigation plans may not be adequate to cover our losses\nresulting from disasters or other business interruptions.\n*Our business is affected by macroeconomic conditions.\nVarious macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business and the results of our operations and financial condition, including changes in\ninflation, interest rates, or foreign currency exchange rates, natural disasters, geopolitical instability resulting from war, terrorism and other violence, such as the\ninstability caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the conflicts in the Middle East, effects of potential global public health threats and overall economic\nconditions and uncertainties, including those resulting from the current and future conditions in the global financial markets and volatility and disruptions in the\nequity and debt markets. For instance, COVID-19 previously adversely affected our ability to source materials and supplies. Inflation (such as that recently\nobserved in the U.S. and elsewhere) has increased our business costs and could become more significant in the future, and it may not be feasible to pass price\nincreases on to our customers due to the process by which healthcare providers are reimbursed for our products by the government. Interest rates, the liquidity\nof the credit markets and the volatility of the capital markets could also affect the value of our investments and our ability to liquidate our investments in order to\nfund our operations. We purchase or enter into a variety of financial instruments and transactions, including investments in commercial paper, the extension of\ncredit to corporations, institutions and governments and hedging contracts. If any of the issuers or counterparties to these instruments were to default on their\nobligations, it could materially reduce the value of the transaction and adversely affect our cash flows.\nWe sell our products in countries that face economic volatility and weakness. Although we have historically collected receivables from customers in\nthose countries, sustained weakness or further deterioration of the local economies and currencies may cause customers in those countries to be unable to pay\nfor our products. Additionally, if one or more of these countries were unable to purchase our products, our revenues would be adversely affected.\nInterest rates and the ability to access credit markets could also adversely affect the ability of our customers/distributors to purchase, pay for and\neffectively distribute our products, which could limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials and supplies necessary for production of our therapies. Similarly,\nthese macroeconomic factors could affect the ability of our contract manufacturers, sole-source or single-source suppliers to remain in business or otherwise\nmanufacture or supply product. Failure by any of them to remain a going concern could affect our ability to manufacture products.\nAdditionally, effects of any pandemic or other global public health threat on all aspects of our business and operations and the duration of such effects\nare highly uncertain and difficult to predict. For instance, a global pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, which could reduce\nour ability to access capital and could negatively affect our liquidity and the liquidity and stability of markets for our common stock and Notes. In addition, a\nrecession, further market correction or depression resulting from a future global public health threat could materially adversely affect our business and the value\nof our common stock and Notes.\nTo the extent macroeconomic conditions continue to adversely affect our business and financial results, they may also have the effect of heightening\nmany of the other risks described in this Risk Factors section, such as those relating to our conducting a significant amount of our sales and operations outside\nof the U.S., exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness and finance our operations\nand the volatility of our stock price.\n59\nTable of Contents\nItem 2.
