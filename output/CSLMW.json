(“Fusemachines”), a New York-based enterprise AI transformation business with a unique 10-year track record of increasing ROI for US enterprise companies to consummate a business combination (“Business Combination”).CSLM continues to believe that Fusemachines is at the leading edge of true AI companies and is well-positioned to continue to capitalize on the growing interest by businesses in mining the benefits associated with artificial intelligence and machine learning in gaining efficiencies and maximizing revenues and margins from predictive algorithms. Since CSLM first announced the proposed Business Combination in January 2024, Fusemachines has made great progress on completing the audit of their financial statements, and believes that the first confidential filing of SEC Form S-4 Registration Statement will be coming in the next weeks. Sameer Maskey, Founder and CEO of Fusemachines, said “We are very excited at the prospect of soon reaching a major milestone event on our journey of becoming a public company and are looking forward to completing the business combination with CSLM later this year.”Because of the expected time needed to close the Business Combination, CSLM filed SEC Form 14A on August 8, 2024 providing notice of its annual general meeting to be held on August 18, 2024 where several proposals will be considered, including a proposal to extend the time to close the Business Combination on a month-to-month basis, until July 18, 2025. If approved, Consilium Acquisition Sponsor I, LLC (the “Sponsor”) has agreed to contribute $30,000.00 as a loan to CSLM for each one-month extension, which amount will be deposited in CSLM’s trust account held by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, by the 18th of each month beginning August 18, 2024.CSLM’s board of directors recommends that all shareholders should vote “For” all the proposals, including the proposal to extend the time to complete the Business Combination. Each shareholder’s vote is important and instructions contained in the proxy should be followed to make sure a vote is submitted on time and is counted.Additional Information and Where to Find ItNo offering of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or an exemption therefrom. Before making any voting decision, investors and security holders of cslm are urged to read schedule 14a, the proxy statement and all other relevant documents filed or that will be filed with the sec in connection with the annual general meeting as they become available.CSLM has filed with the SEC a definitive proxy statement (the “Proxy Statement”) in connection with the annual general meeting of its stockholders (the “Meeting”) to consider and vote upon certain amendments to CSLM’s charter, including an amendment to extend the date by which it must consummate its initial business combination (the “Extension”) and, beginning on August 8, 2024, mailed the Extension Proxy Statement and other relevant documents to its stockholders of record as of August 6, 2024, the record date for the Meeting. CSLM’s stockholders and other interested persons are advised to read the Proxy Statement and any other relevant documents that have been or will be filed with the SEC in connection with CSLM’s Meeting because these documents will contain important information about CSLM, the Extension and other matters.Investors and security holders can obtain free copies of the Proxy Statement through the website maintained by the SEC at [www.sec.gov](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&esheet=53321139&newsitemid=20230213005619&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sec.gov&index=5&md5=209f6d8c11997a89640e372bab8c077f).

Forward-looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as \"believe,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"estimate,\" \"continue,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"expect,\" \"should,\" \"would,\" \"plan,\" \"project,\" \"forecast,\" \"predict,\" \"potential,\" \"seem,\" \"seek,\" \"future,\" \"outlook,\" and similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward looking. In addition to factors previously disclosed in CSLM's reports filed with the SEC and those identified elsewhere in this communication, the following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements or historical performance: (1) statements regarding estimates and forecasts of other financial, performance and operational metrics and projections of market opportunity; (2) references with respect to the anticipated benefits of the Proposed Business Combination and the projected future financial performance of Fusemachines following the Proposed Business Combination; (3) changes in the market for Fusemachines' services and technology, expansion plans and opportunities; (4) the sources and uses of cash in connection with the Proposed Business Combination; (5) the anticipated capitalization and enterprise value of the combined company following the consummation of the Proposed Business Combination; (6) the projected technological developments of Fusemachines; (7) current and future potential commercial and customer relationships; (8) the ability to operate efficiently at scale; (9) anticipated investments in capital resources and research and development, and the effect of these investments; (10) the ability of the combined company to issue equity or equity-linked securities in the future; (11) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the business combination agreement; (12) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Fusemachines or CSLM following announcement of the Proposed Business Combination and the transactions contemplated thereby; (13) the inability to complete the Proposed Business Combination due to, among other things, the failure to obtain CSLM stockholder approval on the expected terms and schedule as well as the risk that regulatory approvals required for the Proposed Business Combination are not obtained or are obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; (14) the risk that the Proposed Business Combination or another business combination may not be completed by CSLM's business combination deadline and the potential failure to obtain an extension of the business combination deadline; (15) unexpected costs related to the Proposed Business Combination; (16) limited liquidity and trading of CSLM's securities; (17) geopolitical risk and changes in applicable laws or regulations; (18) the possibility that CSLM and/or Fusemachines be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; (19) the inability to obtain or maintain the listing of the combined company's common stock on Nasdaq following the Proposed Business Combination, including but not limited to redemptions exceeding anticipated levels or the failure to meet Nasdaq's initial listing standards in connection with the consummation of the Proposed Business Combination; and (20) expectations related to the terms and timing of the Proposed Business Combination. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of CSLM's and Fusemachines' management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of CSLM and Fusemachines. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, as set forth in the section entitled \"Risk Factors'' and \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements'' in CSLM's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was filed with the SEC on March 31, 2023 and in CSLM's IPO prospectus, filed with the SEC on January 6, 2022, and in the Registration Statement and the other documents that CSLM has filed, or will file, with the SEC relating to the Proposed Business Combination. If any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties above are not exhaustive, and there may be additional risks that neither CSLM nor Fusemachines presently know or that CSLM and Fusemachines currently believe are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward looking statements reflect CSLM's and Fusemachines' expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. CSLM and Fusemachines anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause CSLM's and Fusemachines' assessments to change. However, while CSLM and Fusemachines may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, CSLM and Fusemachines specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing CSLM's and Fusemachines' assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements.\n\n**Media Contact** Kathleen Wolf-LegerEmail:kat@fusemachines.comPhone: (347) 212-5075\n\nSOURCE Fusemachines Inc\n\n[ View all news ](/investor-relations/default.aspx)\n\n[![Consilium](//s29.q4cdn.com/604099291/files/design/logo.png)](/)\n\n#### Contact\n\nInfo@cimspac.com\n\n[1 954 315 9380](tel:1 954 315 9380 )\n\n  * [Home](https://www.cimspac.com/home/default.aspx)\n  * [Team](https://www.cimspac.com/team/default.aspx)\n  * [Press Releases](https://www.cimspac.com/investor-relations/default.aspx)\n  * [Contact](https://www.cimspac.com/contact-us/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n[ Powered By Q4 Inc. 5.140.1.1 (opens in new window) ](https://www.q4inc.com/Powered-by-Q4/)\n"

Any\nperson who becomes aware of any existing or potential breach of this Code is required to notify\nthe Chairman of the Board promptly.

Any person who believes such improper influence is being exerted should report\nsuch action to such person’s supervisor, or if that is impractical under the circumstances, to any\nof the Company’s directors.\n5\nTypes of conduct that could constitute improper influence include, but are not limited to,\ndirectly or indirectly:\n• offering or paying bribes or other financial incentives, including future\nemployment or contracts for non-audit services;\n• providing an auditor with an inaccurate or misleading legal analysis;\n• threatening to cancel or canceling existing non-audit or audit engagements if the\nauditor objects to the Company’s accounting;\n• seeking to have a partner removed from the audit engagement because the partner\nobjects to the Company’s accounting;\n• blackmailing; and\n• making physical threats.\n10.

          "content": "CONSILIUM ACQUISITION CORP I, LTD.\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES\nADOPTED JANUARY 5, 2022\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Consilium Acquisition Corp I, Ltd., a Cayman Islands\nexempted company (the “Company”), has adopted these Corporate Governance Guidelines to reflect\nthe Company’s commitment to good corporate governance and to comply with The Nasdaq Stock\nMarket LLC (“Nasdaq”) rules and other legal requirements. These guidelines reflect the Board’s\njudgment as it relates to sound corporate governance practices by which the Board oversees the\nCompany’s business affairs. It is the Board’s intention that these guidelines serve to help ensure the\ncontinued responsible and value-driven management and control of the Company. These guidelines are\nsubject to change from time to time by the Board in its sole discretion.\nBOARD COMPOSITION AND DIRECTOR QUALIFICATIONS\nBoard Membership Criteria\nSubject to the terms of any shareholders agreement that sets forth procedures governing the nomination\nof directors to the Board or if the Company is otherwise required to provide third parties with the ability\nto nominate directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the “NCG Committee”)\nis responsible for reviewing the background and qualifications of individuals being considered as\ndirector candidates and recommending any proposed changes to the Board. Among the qualifications\nconsidered in the selection of candidates, the NCG Committee will look at the following attributes and\ncriteria of candidates: experience, skills, expertise, diversity, personal and professional integrity,\ncharacter, business judgment, time availability in light of other commitments, dedication and conflicts\nof interest. The NCG Committee may, if it deems appropriate, establish procedures to be followed by\nshareholders in submitting recommendations for Board candidates and the NCG Committee’s policies\nfor consideration of Board candidates recommended by shareholders.\nIndependent Directors\nThe Company defines an “independent” director in accordance with Nasdaq Marketplace\nRule 5605(a)(2). Subject to the phase-in rules of Nasdaq, the Board will be composed of a majority of\nindependent directors. Whether directors are independent will be reviewed annually in connection with\nthe preparation of the Company's proxy statement. The NCG Committee, as well as the Board, will\nreview commercial and other relationships between directors and the Company to make a determination\nregarding the independence of each of the directors, but the final independence determination will be\nmade by the Board after due deliberation.\nDirectors Who Cease to be Independent\nAn independent director who ceases to qualify as such after appointment to the Board will be required\nto tender a resignation as a director promptly to the NCG Committee. The NCG Committee will\nconsider the tendered resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the\nresignation, taking into consideration the effect of such change on the interests of the Company.\nDirectors Who Change Their Job Responsibility\nWhen a director’s principal occupation or business association changes substantially from that which\nhe or she held when originally invited to join the Board (including retirement), he or she will promptly\nnotify the NCG Committee and the NCG Committee will evaluate whether the change in circumstances\nis consistent with the Board’s original intent for selecting that director and the current guidelines for\nmembership on the Board. Following its evaluation, the NCG Committee will recommend to the entire\nBoard whether to nominate the director for re-appointment at the next annual meeting of shareholders\nat which such director will be up for re-appointment. While the Board does not believe that a director\npresenting such changes should necessarily leave the Board, there should be an opportunity for the\nBoard, through the NCG Committee, to review the appropriateness of the director’s re-appointment to\nthe Board.\nBoard Tenure\nIn accordance with the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association,\nthere are no established term limits for service on the Board.\nDirector Retirement\nThere are no established limits for retirement from the Board.\nNotification of Additional Board Service\nDirectors will advise the non-independent directors of the Board and the Chairperson of the NGC\nCommittee in advance of accepting an invitation to serve on another public company board (for the\navoidance of doubt, a public company is a company with publicly traded equity). Service on boards\nand committees of other organizations should be consistent with the Company’s Code of Ethics and\nBusiness Conduct. If a member of the Company’s Audit Committee serves on more than three public\ncompany audit committees, the Board will determine whether such simultaneous service impairs the\ndirector’s ability to serve effectively on the Company’s Audit Committee. The Board does not feel\nthat it is appropriate to limit the number of public company boards on which directors may serve.\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS RESPONSIBILITIES\nThe business affairs of the Company are managed under the direction of the Board. The Board believes\nthat the primary responsibilities of directors are to exercise their business judgment in good faith and to\nact in what they reasonably believe is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Directors\nmust fulfill their responsibilities consistent with their fiduciary duty to the Company, in compliance\nwith all applicable rules and regulations. In forming his or her judgment, each director is entitled to rely\nin good faith on the accuracy of the records of the Company and the information, opinions, reports or\nstatements presented by the Company’s officers, employees, Board committees, outside advisors and\nauditors. In discharging that obligation, directors are entitled to rely on the honesty and integrity of the\nCompany’s senior executives and its outside advisors and auditors.\n2\nThe Board recognizes that certain of the Company’s officers and directors presently have, and any of\nthem in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to\nwhich such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to\nsuch entity. Accordingly, the Board recognizes that if any of the Company’s officers or directors\nbecomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she\nhas then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may need to honor those fiduciary or\ncontractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to\napplicable fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law.\nBOARD MEETINGS AND PROCEDURES\nMeeting Frequency\nFollowing the Company’s initial business combination, the Board will hold at least one regularly\nscheduled meeting each quarter.\nChairperson of the Board\nThe person who holds the office of the Chairperson, if applicable, of the Board (the “Chairperson”) will\npreside over all meetings of the directors, be responsible for the agenda at all meetings of the Board and\nwill preside over general meetings of the Company. The Chairperson will convey recommendations of\nthe independent directors to the Board of Directors and will be the liaison between the Board and the\nmanagement of the Company. The Chairperson will preview information sent to the Board as necessary\nand approve meeting schedules to assure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items.\nIf there is no person who holds the office of Chairperson of the Company, or if at any meeting the\nChairperson is not present within five minutes after the time appointed for the meeting to commence,\nthe Directors present may choose one of their number to be chairperson of the meeting.\nAgenda Items\nEach director is free to suggest agenda items to the Chairperson and to raise at any meeting topics not\non the agenda.\nAttendance\nAll directors are expected to make reasonable best efforts to attend all meetings of the Board, meetings\nof the committees of which they are members and any annual meeting of shareholders. Members are\nencouraged to attend Board meetings and meetings of committees of which they are members in person,\nbut may also attend such meetings by telephone or video conference.\nMeeting Materials and Preparation\nInformation and materials important to the Board’s understanding of topics expected to be discussed at\nmeetings should, to the extent practical, be distributed sufficiently in advance to permit prior review. In\n3\nthe event of a meeting on short notice, or if materials would contain highly confidential or sensitive\ninformation, it is recognized that written materials might not be available in advance.\nEach director should be sufficiently familiar with the business of the Company, including its financial\nstatements and capital structure, and the risks and competition it faces, to facilitate active and effective\nparticipation in the deliberations of the Board and of each committee on which he or she serves.\nManagement will make appropriate personnel available to answer any questions a director may have\nabout any aspect of the Company’s business. Directors should also review the materials provided by\nmanagement and advisors in advance of the meetings of the Board and its committees and should arrive\nprepared to discuss the issues presented.\nSeparate Sessions of Non-Management Directors\nNon-management directors will meet regularly, in executive session, without management. If not a\nmember of management, the Chairperson (if any) will preside in executive session. If there is no\nChairperson or the Chairperson is absent or disqualified, the Chairperson of the Audit Committee, if\nindependent, will preside. If the Chairperson of the Audit Committee is absent, or not independent, an\nindependent director designated by the other independent directors will preside.\nIn the event that the non-management directors include directors who are not independent, the Company\nwill, at least once a year, schedule an executive session including only independent directors.\nDIRECTOR COMMUNICATIONS\nDirector Communications with Management and Outside Advisors\nIt is management’s job to formulate, propose and implement strategic choices and the Board’s role to\napprove and evaluate strategic direction and results. However, the Board and management are better\nable to perform their responsibilities if there is an ongoing dialogue among the Chief Executive Officer,\nother senior managers and Board members. To facilitate these discussions, directors will have access to\nthe Company’s senior management team. In addition, non-management directors are encouraged to\ncontact senior managers of the Company without senior corporate management present. The Board and\nits committees shall have the right at any time to retain independent outside accounting, financial, legal\nor other advisors, and the Company shall provide appropriate funding, as determined by the Board or\nany committee, to compensate such independent outside advisors, as well as to cover the ordinary\nadministrative expenses incurred by the Board and its committees in carrying out their duties.\nBoard Interaction with Institutional Investors, Analysts, Press and Customers\nGenerally, management should speak for the Company. Each director should refer all inquiries from\ninstitutional investors, analysts, the press or customers to the Chief Executive Officer or his or her\ndesignee.\nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION\nThe Board, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, will establish the form and\namount of compensation to be paid to directors, if any, and review this compensation each year.\n4\nDIRECTOR ORIENTATION AND CONTINUING EDUCATION\nThe Company will provide each new director with an orientation packet to familiarize him or her with,\namong other things, the Company’s (i) acquisition plan or, following its initial business combination,\nits business and strategic plans, (ii) significant financial, accounting and risk management issues, (iii)\ncompliance programs, (iv) code of ethics and business conduct, (v) insider trading policy, (vi) corporate\ngovernance guidelines, (vii) principal officers and (viii) independent auditors.\nEach director is expected to be involved in continuing director education on an ongoing basis to enable\nhim or her to better perform his or her duties and to recognize and deal appropriately with issues that\narise, if prior to the Company’s initial business combination, in light of the Company’s goal of finding\nan acquisition target and completing an initial business combination. The Company will pay all\nreasonable expenses related to the continuing director education.\nCOMMITTEES OF THE BOARD\nNumber, Structure and Appointment of Committee Members\nThe Board shall have at all times three (3) standing committees: an Audit Committee, a Compensation\nCommittee and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. All members of these committees\nshall be independent directors, subject to the phase-in rules of Nasdaq, and shall be appointed by the\nBoard upon recommendation of the NCG Committee. The Board may, from time to time, establish or\nmaintain additional committees as necessary or appropriate.\nCommittee Charters\nEach committee shall discharge its responsibilities in accordance with its own charter. Each committee\ncharter shall set forth: the purposes, goals and responsibilities of the committee; qualifications for\nmembership on the committee; and committee structure and operations. Each committee charter shall\nalso specify procedures for committee member appointment and removal, as well as require that the\ncommittee annually evaluate its performance and report its assessment to the NCG Committee.\nCommittee Meetings\nThe Chairperson of each committee, in consultation with committee members, shall determine the\nfrequency and length of committee meetings.

The evaluation should be based on objective criteria including, but not limited to, the\nperformance of the Company’s business, accomplishment of the Company’s goal of completing an\ninitial business combination and, thereafter, its long-term and short-term strategic objectives and\nmanagement development.\n5\nSuccession Planning\nFrom and after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination, the Compensation\nCommittee, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer, shall annually report to the Board on\nsuccession planning, which shall include emergency Chief Executive Officer succession, Chief\nExecutive Officer succession in the ordinary course and succession for other members of senior\nmanagement. The entire Board will work with the committee to evaluate potential successors to the\nChief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer should at all times make available his or her\nrecommendations and evaluations of potential successors, along with a review of any development plans\nrecommended for such individuals.\nANNUAL PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF THE BOARD\nThe Board will conduct an annual self-evaluation to determine whether it and its committees are\nfunctioning effectively. The NCG Committee shall be responsible for conducting this evaluation by\nannually assessing the performance of the Board and its committees, and reporting its conclusions to\nthe full Board.
