Belanoff, MD, Corcept’s Chief Executive Officer. “Physicians are increasingly aware of hypercortisolism’s true prevalence and of the poor health outcomes of patients who go untreated. Screening is becoming more common and the number of patients receiving appropriate care continues to increase. For patients and physicians who choose Korlym, our extensive system of support services is critical to optimizing the benefit of our medication.” \n\nCorcept’s third quarter 2024 revenue was $182.5 million, compared to $123.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter operating expenses were $135.9 million, compared to $92.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. Net income was $47.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $31.4 million in the same period last year. \n\nThe company increased its 2024 revenue guidance to $675 – $700 million. \n\nCash and investments were $547.6 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $492.5 million at June 30, 2024. The balance at September 30, 2024 reflects the acquisition of $23.4 million of common stock (870,000 shares) in the third quarter pursuant to the company’s stock repurchase program, net exercise of employee stock options and net vesting of restricted stock grants. \n\n**Clinical Development**\n\n“Our clinical development programs have positioned us for a transformative fourth quarter,” added Dr. Belanoff. “We are on track to submit our NDA for relacorilant as a treatment for patients with hypercortisolism (Cushing's syndrome) by year-end. We also expect to release data from (i) the treatment phase of our CATALYST study in patients with Cushing’s syndrome, (ii) ROSELLA, our pivotal study in women with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, and (iii) DAZALS, our study in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) by year-end.” \n\n**Cushing’s Syndrome**\n\n  * _Relacorilant for Cushing’s syndrome – NDA submission expected this quarter_\n  * _GRACE – Pivotal Phase 3 trial of relacorilant in 152 patients with all etiologies of Cushing’s syndrome – primary endpoint achieved in randomized withdrawal phase; open-label phase demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in a broad range of hypercortisolism signs and symptoms; relacorilant was well-tolerated, with no cases of relacorilant-induced hypokalemia, endometrial hypertrophy or related vaginal bleeding, adrenal insufficiency or QT prolongation_\n  * _GRADIENT – Supportive trial data for NDA – Patients treated with relacorilant exhibited clinically meaningful improvements in a broad range of hypercortisolism signs and symptoms in r_ _andomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,__Phase 3 trial in 137 patients with Cushing’s syndrome caused by adrenal gland pathology; relacorilant was well-tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with the GRACE study, including no cases of relacorilant-induced hypokalemia, endometrial hypertrophy or related vaginal bleeding, adrenal insufficiency or QT prolongation_\n  * _CATALYST – Treatment phase of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Korlym in 136 patients with hypercortisolism and difficult-to-control type 2 diabetes; results expected this quarter_\n\n\n\n“GRADIENT’s positive results in patients with Cushing’s syndrome confirm relacorilant’s promise as a significant medical advancement for the treatment of this deadly disease. As was true in the GRACE study, patients in GRADIENT who received relacorilant experienced clinically meaningful improvements in a broad range of hypercortisolism signs and symptoms, without suffering some of the serious adverse effects that can arise in patients taking currently approved treatments,” said Bill Guyer, PharmD, Corcept’s Chief Development Officer. “These data will be a powerful addition to relacorilant’s NDA, which we plan to submit by year-end.” \n\nThe pivotal Phase 3 GRACE trial is the basis for relacorilant’s NDA in Cushing’s syndrome and met its primary endpoint. Patients in GRACE’s initial, open-label phase exhibited clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in hypertension, hyperglycemia and other symptoms experienced by patients with Cushing’s syndrome. In the randomized withdrawal phase, GRACE met its primary endpoint and demonstrated that patients who remained on relacorilant maintained these improvements while those who received placebo saw a significant worsening in their signs and symptoms of hypercortisolism. Consistent with its known safety profile, relacorilant was well-tolerated in both phases of GRACE. \n\nAs part of relacorilant’s NDA in Cushing’s syndrome, the 22-week Phase 3 GRADIENT study supports the GRACE trial by providing further evidence of relacorilant’s efficacy and safety profile. Patients treated with relacorilant in the GRADIENT study exhibited clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in hypertension, hyperglycemia, weight and body composition compared to baseline, while patients who received placebo did not. The trial’s primary endpoint was the improvement in systolic blood pressure (SBP) compared to placebo with hyperglycemia, weight and body composition as secondary endpoints. \n\nPatients who entered GRADIENT with hypertension and received relacorilant exhibited clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in mean SBP at 22 weeks (reduction of 6.6 mm Hg; p-value: 0.012), compared to baseline. Patients who received placebo did not (reduction of 2.1 mm Hg; p-value: ns), compared to baseline. The comparison between those who received relacorilant and placebo was not statistically significant. During the study, 5 patients who received placebo compared to 1 patient who received relacorilant required rescue therapy with anti-hypertension medications. To ensure accuracy, hypertension was measured by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. \n\nGRADIENT patients with hyperglycemia who received relacorilant experienced clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements at 22 weeks in glucose metabolism, including fasting glucose (placebo-adjusted reduction of 22.2 mg/dL; p-value: 0.002), area under the curve of the oral glucose tolerance test (placebo-adjusted reduction of 2.6 h*mmol/L; p-value: 0.046) and hemoglobin A1c (placebo-adjusted reduction of 0.3 percent; p-value: 0.019), compared to those who received placebo. \n\nPatients in GRADIENT who received relacorilant experienced clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements at 22 weeks in body weight (placebo-adjusted reduction of 3.9 kg; p-value: 0.0001) and both visceral adipose fat mass and volume (p-values: 0.018 and 0.016, respectively), compared to those who received placebo. \n\nRelacorilant was well tolerated in GRADIENT, with side effects consistent with those seen in its Phase 2 and GRACE trials. Across all of these studies, the most common adverse events were mild-to-moderate nausea, edema, pain in extremities and back, and fatigue – all symptoms associated with the “cortisol withdrawal” many patients experience following surgery or start of medical therapy for Cushing’s syndrome. Importantly, there were no relacorilant-induced instances of hypokalemia, relacorilant-induced endometrial hypertrophy or related vaginal bleeding, adrenal insufficiency or QT prolongation. \n\nComplete results from the GRADIENT trial will be presented at a medical conference next year. \n\n“We are also looking forward to results from the treatment phase of our CATALYST study by year-end,” continued Dr. Guyer. “CATALYST is the largest and most rigorous study ever conducted of hypercortisolism in patients with difficult-to-control diabetes. CATALYST’s prevalence results confirm there are many more patients with Cushing's syndrome than was previously assumed and the trial is poised to be a landmark study in the identification and treatment of patients with hypercortisolism. We are confident it will lead to better health outcomes for many patients who are struggling today.” \n\n**Oncology**\n\n  * _ROSELLA – Enrollment completed in pivotal Phase 3 trial of relacorilant plus nab-paclitaxel in 381 patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer; results expected this quarter_\n  * _Early-stage prostate cancer – Enrollment continues in randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 trial of relacorilant plus enzalutamide in patients with early-stage prostate cancer, conducted in collaboration with the University of Chicago_\n\n\n\n“Relacorilant has the potential to become the standard of care for patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. If ROSELLA replicates the positive results of our large, controlled, Phase 2 study, it will constitute a major medical advance and serve as the basis for relacorilant’s next NDA. We expect progression-free survival data, ROSELLA’s primary endpoint, by the end of this year,” said Dr. Guyer. \n\n**Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)**\n\n  * _DAZALS – Enrollment completed in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 trial of dazucorilant in 249 patients with ALS; results expected this quarter_\n\n\n\n“ALS is a dire disease, with few good treatment options. Our selective cortisol modulator dazucorilant showed great promise in an animal model of ALS, improving motor performance and reducing neuroinflammation and muscular atrophy. We expect data regarding DAZALS’s primary endpoint – improvement in patients’ ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score – by the end of this year. We hope DAZALS will lead to a much-needed advance for patients with ALS,” said Dr. Guyer. \n\n**Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH)**\n\n  * _MONARCH – Enrollment continues in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2b trial of miricorilant in 120 patients with biopsy-confirmed MASH and in 75 patients with presumed MASH_\n\n\n\n“In our Phase 1b study, miricorilant reduced liver fat very rapidly, improved liver health and key metabolic and lipid measures, and was well-tolerated. We look forward to building on these promising results in our MONARCH study,” said Dr. Guyer. “Miricorilant has the potential to greatly benefit the millions of patients with MASH.” \n\n**Conference Call**\n\nWe will hold a conference call on October 30, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time).

Physicians are increasingly aware that hypercortisolism is much more prevalent than was previously assumed, so they are screening more patients for the disorder,” said Joseph K. Belanoff, MD, Corcept’s Chief Executive Officer. “From the launch of Korlym, we implemented a unique system of patient and physician support and have invested in multiple refinements over the past 12 years. Hypercortisolism is a complicated disease and the expertise we have developed is critical to the life-changing impact for patients who receive Korlym treatment.”\n\nCorcept’s second quarter 2024 revenue was $163.8 million, compared to $117.7 million in the second quarter of 2023. Second quarter operating expenses were $128.2 million, compared to $88.1 million in the second quarter of 2023, due to increased spending on clinical trials and sales and marketing activities and to support the expansion of our commercial and clinical development teams. Net income was $35.5 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $27.5 million in the same period last year. Cash and investments were $492.5 million at June 30, 2024 compared to $451.0 million at March 31, 2024.\n\nThe company increased its 2024 revenue guidance to $640 – $670 million.\n\n**Clinical Development**\n\n“During the second quarter we presented the results from our GRACE and CATALYST trials. GRACE’s positive results are a welcome development for patients with hypercortisolism and constitute a significant step toward our new drug application for relacorilant, which we expect to submit in the fourth quarter. In addition, the results from the prevalence phase of our CATALYST study establish that hypercortisolism is a driving biological force in patients with diabetes refractory to treatment. We expect data from the treatment phase of the CATALYST study, as well as our other late-stage studies, GRADIENT, ROSELLA and DAZALS, by the end of this year,” added Dr. Belanoff.\n\n**Cushing’s Syndrome**\n\n  * _GRACE – Phase 3 trial of relacorilant in 152 patients with all etiologies of hypercortisolism – primary endpoint achieved in randomized withdrawal phase; open-label phase demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in hypertension, hyperglycemia, weight, lean muscle mass, waist circumference, cognitive impairment and quality of life_\n  * _Relacorilant New Drug Application (NDA) – NDA submission for Cushing’s syndrome expected in the fourth quarter_\n  * _GRADIENT – Phase 3 trial of relacorilant in 137 patients with Cushing’s syndrome caused by adrenal adenomas – enrollment completed; results expected in the fourth quarter_\n  * _CATALYST – Phase 4 trial examining the prevalence of hypercortisolism in patients with difficult-to-control type 2 diabetes – in the first 1,055 patients enrolled, 24% were found to have hypercortisolism; 136 patients with hypercortisolism entered a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Korlym – treatment phase results expected in the fourth quarter_\n\n\n\n“Relacorilant has demonstrated tremendous promise as a treatment for patients with Cushing’s syndrome. Patients in GRACE’s open-label phase experienced significant improvements across a broad range of clinically meaningful endpoints, without significant safety burden. In the randomized withdrawal phase, GRACE met its primary endpoint and demonstrated that patients who remained on relacorilant maintained these improvements while those who received placebo saw a significant worsening in their signs and symptoms of hypercortisolism,” said Bill Guyer, PharmD, Corcept’s Chief Development Officer.\n\n“Our Phase 4 CATALYST trial is the largest and most rigorous study ever conducted to establish the prevalence of hypercortisolism in patients with difficult-to-control diabetes. The prevalence results from CATALYST confirm there are considerably more patients with Cushing's syndrome than was previously assumed. CATALYST is poised to become the landmark study that guides physicians toward expanded screening for hypercortisolism and will result in better health outcomes for many patients who are struggling today,” said Dr. Guyer.\n\n**Oncology**\n\n  * _ROSELLA – Pivotal Phase 3 trial of relacorilant plus nab-paclitaxel in 381 patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer – enrollment completed; results expected in the fourth quarter_\n  * _Open-label, Phase 1b trial of relacorilant plus pembrolizumab in 14 patients with advanced adrenal cancer with cortisol excess – improvement in Cushing’s syndrome signs and symptoms observed; no change in tumor progression_\n  * _Randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 trial of relacorilant plus enzalutamide in patients with prostate cancer in collaboration with the University of Chicago – enrollment continues_\n\n\n\n“Relacorilant has the potential to become the standard of care for patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. If our pivotal ROSELLA trial replicates the positive results from our large, controlled, Phase 2 study, it will constitute a major medical advance. We expect progression-free survival data, ROSELLA’s primary endpoint, by the end of this year,” said Dr. Guyer.\n\n**Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)**\n\n  * _DAZALS – Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 trial of dazucorilant in 249 patients with ALS – enrollment completed; results expected in the fourth quarter_\n\n\n\n“Dazucorilant showed great promise in an animal model of ALS – improving motor performance and reducing neuroinflammation and muscular atrophy. We expect data by the end of this year and are hopeful that the trial results will create a much-needed advance for patients with ALS,” said Dr. Guyer.\n\n**Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH)**\n\n  * _MONARCH – Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2b trial of miricorilant with a cohort of patients with biopsy-confirmed MASH and a second cohort of patients with presumed MASH based on non-invasive diagnostic tests – enrollment continues_\n\n\n\n“In our Phase 1b study, miricorilant reduced liver fat very rapidly, improved liver health and key metabolic and lipid measures, and was well-tolerated. We look forward to building on these promising results in our MONARCH study,” said Dr. Guyer. “Miricorilant has the potential to greatly benefit the millions of patients with MASH.”\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nWe will hold a conference call on July 29, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time (2:00 p.m. Pacific Time).
