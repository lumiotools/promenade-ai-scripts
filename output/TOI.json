During this period, we continued to break monthly fill records for our oral drug revenue. We recorded a revenue increase of 21.8% compared to prior year quarter, while further reducing SG&A. Our performance underscores the effectiveness of our strategy and the commitment of our team, particularly as we navigate a dynamic environment.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results (for the three months ended September 30, 2024)**\n\nConsolidated revenue for Q3 2024 was $99.9 million, an increase of 21.8% compared to Q3 2023, and a 1.3% increase compared to Q2 2024.\n\nRevenue for patient services was $49.8 million, down 7.2% compared to Q3 2023. Dispensary revenue increased 79.9% compared to Q3 2023 primarily due to an increase in the number of filled prescriptions for our California pharmacy. Clinical trials & other revenue increased by 20.5% compared to Q3 2023 primarily due to an increase in California Proposition 56 revenue and TOI Clinical Research revenue.\n\nGross profit in Q3 2024 was $14.4 million, a decrease of 10.1% compared to Q3 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by ongoing cost management fluctuations and DIR fee run out of oral and IV drugs. Gross profit is calculated by subtracting direct costs of patient services, dispensary, and clinical trials and other from consolidated revenues.\n\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses in Q3 2024 were $26.6 million or 26.7% of revenue, compared with $28.2 million, or 34.4% of revenue, in Q3 2023. During Q3 2024, share-based compensation expense was $2.4 million. The decrease in SG&A expenses was due to a re-alignment and negotiations with our vendors and a decrease in share-based compensation expense of approximately $2.3 million compared to the same quarter prior year.\n\nNet loss for Q3 2024 was $16.1 million, a decrease of $1.3 million compared to Q3 2023 primarily due to a change in the fair value of derivative liabilities of $20 thousand resulting in a gain in Q3 2024 as compared to $1.5 million loss in Q3 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $(8.2) million, a decrease of $2.9 million compared to Q3 2023, primarily due to a decrease in gross profit.\n\n**Nine Months ended 2024 Results (for the nine months ended September 30, 2024)**\n\nConsolidated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $293.1 million, an increase of 22.9% compared to the same period prior year.\n\nRevenue for patient services in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $154.7 million, down 1.7% compared to the same period prior year. Dispensary revenue increased 73.6% compared to the same period prior year due to an increase in the number of filled prescriptions related to our California pharmacy. Clinical trials & other revenue increased by 25.8% compared to the same period prior year primarily due to an increase in California Proposition 56 revenue and TOI Clinical Research revenue.\n\nGross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $39.4 million, a decrease of 12.9% compared to the same period prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by ongoing cost management fluctuations. Gross profit is calculated by subtracting direct costs of patient services, dispensary, and clinical trials and other from consolidated revenues.\n\nSG&A expenses for nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $83.0 million or 28.3% of revenue, compared with $85.8 million or 36.0% of revenue, for the same period prior year. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, share-based compensation expense was $9.9 million compared to $13.7 million for the same period of 2023.\n\nNet loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $51.5 million, a decrease of $12.8 million compared to the same period prior year, primarily due to a $16.9 million goodwill impairment for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 that did not occur in the same period of 2024, partially offset by the change in the fair value of derivative liabilities.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $(27.8) million, a decrease of $8.2 million compared to the same period prior year, primarily due to a decrease in gross profit.\n\n**Review of Strategic Alternatives**\n\nTOI has completed its review of strategic, financial, and operational alternatives. After a thorough and careful assessment of a range of options, the Company’s Board of Directors has determined that the best course of action is to continue with its current strategic plan. This decision reflects the Board’s confidence in the Company’s core strengths, market position, and growth potential in light of our recent positive business development activity.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call**\n\nTOI will host a conference call on Wednesday, November 13, 2024 at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) to discuss third quarter results and management’s outlook for future financial and operational performance.\n\nThe conference call can be accessed live over the phone by dialing 1-877-407-0789, or for international callers, 1-201-689-8562.

These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding projections, anticipated financial results, estimates and forecasts of revenue and other financial and performance metrics and projections of market opportunity and expectations. These statements are based on various assumptions and on the current expectations of TOI and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by anyone as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of TOI. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the accuracy of the assumptions underlying the 2024 outlook discussed herein, the outcome of judicial and administrative proceedings to which TOI may become a party or investigations to which TOI may become or is subject that could interrupt or limit TOI’s operations, result in adverse judgments, settlements or fines and create negative publicity; changes in TOI’s patient or payors' preferences, prospects and the competitive conditions prevailing in the healthcare sector; failure to address the need to meet stock exchange continued listing standards and the possibility that the Company may have to effect a reverse stock split; the impact of COVID-19 on TOI’s business; those factors discussed in the documents of TOI filed, or to be filed, with the SEC, including the Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" section of TOI's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024 and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K. If the risks materialize or assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements.

Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements.\n\n**Financial Information; Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nSome of the financial information and data contained in this press release, such as Adjusted EBITDA, have not been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). TOI’s non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Because of the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures, you should consider the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release in conjunction with TOI’s financial statements and the related notes thereto.\n\nTOI believes that the use of Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool to assess operational performance and results of our performance to plan and forecast future periods, and factors and trends in, and in comparing our financial measures with, other similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. The principal limitation of Adjusted EBITDA is that it excludes significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in TOI's financial statements.\n\nTOI defines Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income plus depreciation, amortization, interest, taxes, non-cash items, share-based compensation, goodwill impairment charges, change in fair value of liabilities, unrealized gains or losses on investments and other adjustments to add-back the following: consulting and legal fees related to acquisitions, one-time consulting and legal fees related to certain advisory projects, software implementations and debt or equity financings, severance expense and temporary labor and recruiting charges to build out our corporate infrastructure. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most comparable GAAP metric, is set forth below.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Change**  \n _(dollars in thousands)_| **2024**| **2023**| **$**| **%**  \nNet loss| $| (16,113| )| $| (17,419| )| $| 1,306| (7.5| )%  \nDepreciation and amortization| 1,573| 1,698| (125| )| (7.4| )%  \nInterest expense, net| 2,225| 1,755| 470| 26.8|  %  \nIncome tax expense| —| 136| (136| )| (100.0| )%  \nNon-cash addbacks(1)| (102| )| (13| )| (89| )| 684.6|  %  \nShare-based compensation| 2,388| 4,658| (2,270| )| (48.7| )%  \nChanges in fair value of liabilities| (20| )| 1,464| (1,484| )| (101.4| )%  \nUnrealized (gains) losses on investments| (18| )| (156| )| 138| (88.5| )%  \nPractice acquisition-related costs(2)| —| 41| (41| )| (100.0| )%  \nPost-combination compensation expense(3)| 45| 399| (354| )| (88.7| )%  \nConsulting and legal fees(4)| 352| 1| 351| 35,100.0|  %  \nInfrastructure and workforce costs(5)| 1,473| 1,978| (505| )| (25.5| )%  \nTransaction costs(6)| —| 112| (112| )| (100.0| )%  \n**Adjusted EBITDA**|  $| (8,197| )| $| (5,346| )| $| (2,851| )| 53.3|  %  \n  \n(1) During the three months ended September 30, 2024, non-cash addbacks were primarily comprised of non-cash rent of $104 offset by net credit loss of $2.
