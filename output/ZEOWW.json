Also, our asset-light business model allowed us to drive our profitability metrics, and we finished 2023 with $20.2 million in gross profit and $11.2 in adjusted EBITDA. We opened a new market in Missouri as well, advancing our commitment to geographic expansion in the US.\n\n“We believe that our completed merger is the necessary spark for us to accelerate our growth strategy,” Bridgewater continued. “As we turn to 2024, we remain confident in our approach to providing residential solar solutions to high growth markets. We plan to expand into several new geographies, drive sustainable profitability, and take additional market share in the residential solar space, all in service of our mission to serve more customers seeking to meet their power and energy storage needs. We believe we have the right talent on our teams around the country to accomplish our goals, and we look forward to the path ahead for Zeo Energy.”\n\n**Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results** _Results compare the 2023 fiscal fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023, to the 2022 fiscal fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022, unless otherwise indicated._\n\n  * Net revenue totaled $23.4 million, a 2% increase from $22.9 million in the comparable 2022 period. This increase was primarily due to customers adopting our lease finance option.\n  * Gross profit increased to $3.1 million (13.4% of net revenue) from $2.9 million (12.8% of net revenue) for the comparable 2022 period. The increase in gross profit was driven by the increase in net revenue.\n  * Net income decreased to a loss of $0.1 million (-0.6% of net revenue) from a net income of approximately $1.1 million (4.7% of net revenue) in the comparable 2022 period. This decrease was primarily due to higher costs for expenses related to the launch of new technology to support our financing partners as well as legal, accounting, and consulting expenses related to the Business Combination.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measurement of operating performance reconciled below, decreased to $1.3 million (5.6% of net revenue) from approximately $1.5 million (6.7% of net revenue) in the comparable 2022 period.\n\n\n\n**Full Year 2023 Financial Results** _Results compare the full year ended December 31, 2023 to the full year ended December 31, 2022 unless otherwise indicated._\n\n  * Net revenue totaled $110.1 million, a 23.7% increase from $89.0 million in the comparable 2022 period. This increase was primarily due to recruiting a greater number of sales reps and sales dealerships to work with Sunergy.\n  * Gross profit increased to $20.2 million (18.3% of net revenue) from $16.0 million (18.0% of net revenue) for the comparable 2022 period. The increase in gross profit was driven by the increase in net revenue.\n  * Net income decreased to $6.2 million (5.7% of net revenue) from $8.7 million (9.7% of net revenue) in the comparable 2022 period. This decrease was primarily due to one-time costs associated with the Business Combination.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measurement of operating performance reconciled below, increased to $11.2 million (10.2% of net revenue) from approximately $10.4 million (11.7% of net revenue) in the comparable 2022 period.\n  * As of December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents totaled $8.0 million, compared to $4.3 million at September 30, 2023 and $2.3 million at December 31, 2022.\n\n\n\nFor more information, please visit the Zeo investor relations website at [investors.zeoenergy.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=XDSVBC2m-Fwj52Y61eMxUieBcwzx3JoA0IcSHpoOiVP9c3C6wEGfnmExli-3CXRa9tQtINOnhRwk1JuYrz2dn7jPbHYQd_aUml_OkpEMDR4= \"investors.zeoenergy.com\") _._\n\n**About Zeo Energy Corp.** Zeo Energy Corp. is a Florida-based regional provider of residential solar, distributed energy, and energy efficiency solutions. Zeo is focused on high growth markets with limited competitive saturation. With its differentiated sales approach and vertically integrated offerings, Zeo, through its subsidiary, Sunergy by Zeo Energy, serves customers who desire to reduce high energy bills and contribute to a more sustainable future.\n\n**_Non-GAAP Financial Measures_**\n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA_** _Zeo Energy defines Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net income (loss) before interest and other expenses, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation and merger and acquisition expenses (“_** _M &A expenses_** _”). Zeo utilizes Adjusted EBITDA as an internal performance measure in the management of the Company’s operations because the Company believes the exclusion of these non-cash and non-recurring charges allows for a more relevant comparison of Zeo’s results of operations to other companies in the industry. Adjusted EBITDA should not be viewed as a substitute for net loss calculated in accordance with GAAP, and other companies may define Adjusted EBITDA differently._\n\n_The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:_\n\n**Year ended December 31,**| **Three months ended December 31,**  \n---|---  \n**2023**| **2022**| **2023**| **2022**  \nNet Income| $| 6,230,438| $| 8,665,770| $| (139,439| )| $| 1,081,412  \nAdjustments  \nInterest expense| 123,996| 51,295| 84,158| 13,335  \nTaxes| -| -| -| -  \nDepreciation and amortization| 1,860,188| 1,706,243| 413,562| 444,036  \nOther expense, net| 183,401| 2,510| 190,383| 4,938  \nMerger transaction expenses| 2,820,605| -| 767,179| -  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 11,218,628| $| 10,425,818| $| 1,315,843| $| 1,543,721  \n  \n**_Adjusted EBITDA Margin_** _Zeo Energy defines Adjusted EBITDA margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, expressed as a percentage, as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to revenue, net. Adjusted EBITDA margin measures net income (loss) before interest and other expenses, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted to M &A expenses and is expressed as a percentage of revenue. In the table above, Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss). Zeo utilizes Adjusted EBITDA margin as an internal performance measure in the management of the Company’s operations because the Company believes the exclusion of these non-cash and non-recurring charges allows for a more relevant comparison of the Company’s results of operations to other companies in Zeo’s industry._\n\n_The following table sets forth Zeo’s calculations of Adjusted EBITDA margin for the periods presented:_\n\n**Year ended December 31,**| **Three months ended December 31,**  \n---|---  \n**2023**| **2022**| **2023**| **2022**  \nNumerator: Adjusted EBITDA| $| 11,218,628| $| 10,425,818| $| 1,315,843| $| 1,543,721  \nDenominator: Revenue, net| $| 110,066,601| $| 88,963,855| $| 23,361,581| $| 22,894,599  \nRatio of Adjusted EBITDA to revenue, net| 10.2| %| 11.7| %| 5.6| %| 6.7| %  \n  \n**_Forward-Looking Statements_** _This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are based on beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to Zeo. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements that refer to projections, forecasts, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions. The words “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “seek,” “believe,” “project,” “estimate,” “expect,” “strategy,” “future,” “likely,” “may,” “should,” “will,” and similar references to future periods may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements may include, for example, statements about the benefits of the Business Combination; the future financial performance of Zeo following the Business Combination; changes in Zeo’s strategy, future operations, financial position, estimated revenues and losses, projected costs, prospects, the ability to raise additional funds after the Business Combination, and plans and objectives of management. These forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this news release, and current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks, and uncertainties. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Zeo’s views as of any subsequent date, and Zeo does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. As a result of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, Zeo’s actual results or performance may be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include: (i) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Zeo or others related to the Business Combination; (ii) the company’s success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, its officers, key employees, or directors following the Business Combination; (iii) the Company’s ability to maintain the listing of its common stock and warrants on the Nasdaq following the Business Combination; (iv) the risk that the Business Combination disrupts current plans and operations of Zeo; (v) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination; (vi) limited liquidity and trading of the Company’s securities; (vii) geopolitical risk and changes in applicable laws or regulations; (viii) the possibility that Zeo may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; (ix) operational risk; (x) litigation and regulatory enforcement risks, including the diversion of management time and attention and the additional costs and demands on Zeo’s resources; and (xi) other risks and uncertainties, including those included under the heading “Risk Factors” in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in its subsequent periodic reports and other filings with the SEC. In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should not regard these statements as a representation or warranty by Zeo, their respective directors, officers or employees or any other person that Zeo will achieve their objectives and plans in any specified time frame, or at all. The forward-looking statements in this news release represent the views of Zeo as of the date of this news release. Subsequent events and developments may cause that view to change. However, while Zeo may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, there is no current intention to do so, except to the extent required by applicable law. You should, therefore, not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing the views of Zeo as of any date subsequent to the date of this news release._\n\n**Zeo Energy Corp.

(the “Business Combination”) that will result in the combined company becoming publicly listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary** “Our team delivered a strong and resilient third quarter,” said Sunergy CEO Tim Bridgewater. “Even as our industry faced significant headwinds, we maintained consistent revenue of $37.9 million in the quarter. We saw solar system installations increase across geographies and opened a new market, Missouri, during the quarter as well. New geography expansion remains a pillar of our growth strategy, and we’re confident that our success across these markets is a sign of continued market share expansion in the coming quarters.\n\n“As we look to 2024, we remain focused on completing our business combination with ESGEN Acquisition Corp. and on our successful listing on Nasdaq,” Bridgewater continued. “Also, we are expanding into three additional states in 2024, including Ohio, Illinois, and Virginia. We’ve maintained a strong track record of financial performance and profitability in recent years, and are confident that we’ll be able to continue driving growth with our differentiated approach to selling residential solar systems. As we announced last week, we believe that our updated transaction terms empower us to continue investing in our long-term strategy. We look forward to increasing sales and profitability for Sunergy.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results** _Results compare the 2023 fiscal third quarter ended September 30, 2023 to the 2022 fiscal third quarter ended September 30, 2022 unless otherwise indicated._\n\n  * Net revenue totaled $37.9 million, a 3% decrease from $38.9 million in the comparable 2022 period. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates slowing sales volume over the previous two quarters.\n  * Gross profit decreased to $8.4 million (22.2% of net revenue) from $10.0 million (25.9% of net revenue) for the comparable 2022 period. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to increased equipment and materials costs during the quarter.\n  * Net income decreased to $4.0 million (10.5% of net revenue) from a net income of approximately $7.6 million (19.6% of net revenue) in the comparable 2022 period. This decrease was primarily due to higher equipment and materials costs as well as legal, accounting, and consulting expenses related to the Business Combination.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measurement of operating performance reconciled below, decreased to $5.4 million (14.2% of net revenue) from approximately $8.1 million (20.8% of net revenue) in the comparable 2022 period.\n\n\n\n**First Nine Months 2023 Financial Results** _Results compare the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2022 unless otherwise indicated._\n\n  * Net revenue totaled $86.7 million, a 31% increase from $66.1 million in the comparable 2022 period. This increase was primarily due to recruiting a greater number of sales reps and sales dealerships to the Sunergy sales organization.\n  * Gross profit increased to $17.1 million (19.7% of net revenue) from $13.1 million (19.9% of net revenue) for the comparable 2022 period.\n  * Net income decreased to $6.4 million (7.3% of net revenue) from a net income of approximately $7.6 million (11.5% of net revenue) in the comparable 2022 period. This decrease was primarily due to one-time costs associated with the Business Combination.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measurement of operating performance reconciled below, increased to $9.9 million (11.4% of net revenue) from approximately $8.8 million (13.3% of net revenue) in the comparable 2022 period.\n  * As of September 30, 2023, cash totaled $4.3 million, compared to $3.4 million at June 30, 2023 and $2.3 million at December 31, 2022.\n\n\n\nThe closing of the proposed Business Combination is expected to take place in the first half of 2024, subject to stockholder approval.

With its differentiated sales approach and vertically integrated offerings, Sunergy serves customers who desire to reduce high energy bills and contribute to a more sustainable future.\n\n**About ESGEN Acquisition Corp.** ESGEN (Nasdaq: ESACU, ESAC, ESACW) is a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. ESGEN is led by Chief Executive Officer, Andrejka Bernatova and Chief Financial Officer, Nader Daylami, and is affiliated with Energy Spectrum Capital, a Dallas-based private investment firm with long-standing experience building companies across the energy infrastructure landscape over multiple decades.\n\n**_Non-GAAP Financial Measures_**\n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA_** _Sunergy defines Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as net income (loss) before interest and other expenses, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation and merger and acquisition expenses (“_** _M &A expenses_** _”). Sunergy utilizes Adjusted EBITDA as an internal performance measure in the management of the Company’s operations because the Company believes the exclusion of these non-cash and non-recurring charges allows for a more relevant comparison of Sunergy’s results of operations to other companies in the industry. Adjusted EBITDA should not be viewed as a substitute for net loss calculated in accordance with GAAP, and other companies may define Adjusted EBITDA differently._\n\n_The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:_\n\n**Three months ended September 30,**| **Nine months ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2023**| **2022**| **2023**| **2022**  \nNet income (loss)| $| 3,969,690.29| $| 7,627,304.64| $| 6,369,877.34| $| 7,584,357.74  \nAdjustment:  \nOther income, net| (8,856| )| 14,224| 32,856| (38,277| )  \nDepreciation and amortization| 524,461| 450,099| 1,446,626| 1,262,207  \nIncome tax expense| -| -| -| -  \nM&A Expenses| 891,662| 2,053,426  \n**Adjusted EBITDA**|  $| 5,376,956.43| $| 8,091,626.98| $| 9,902,784.46| $| 8,808,287.90  \n  \n**_Adjusted EBITDA Margin_** _Sunergy defines Adjusted EBITDA margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, expressed as a percentage, as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to revenue, net. Adjusted EBITDA margin measures net income (loss) before interest and other expenses, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted to M &A expenses and is expressed as a percentage of revenue. In the table above, Adjusted EBITDA is reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss). Sunergy utilizes Adjusted EBITDA margin as an internal performance measure in the management of the Company’s operations because the Company believes the exclusion of these non-cash and non-recurring charges allows for a more relevant comparison of the Company’s results of operations to other companies in Sunergy’s industry._\n\n_The following table sets forth Sunergy’s calculations of Adjusted EBITDA margin for the periods presented:_\n\n**Three months ended September 30,**| **Nine months ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2023** |  **2022** |  **2023** |  **2022**  \nNumerator: Adjusted EBITDA| $| 5,376,956.43| $| 8,091,626.98| $| 9,902,784.46| $| 8,808,287.90  \nDenominator: Revenue, net| $| 37,894,165.59| $| 38,873,310.27| $| 86,705,019.71| $| 66,069,255.67  \n**Ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to revenue, net**|  14.19| %| 20.82| %| 11.42| %| 13.33| %  \n  \n**_Forward-Looking Statements_** _This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are based on beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to ESGEN and Sunergy. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions. The words “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “seek,” “believe,” “project,” “estimate,” “expect,” “strategy,” “future,” “likely,” “may,” “should,” “will” and similar references to future periods may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements may include, for example, statements about ESGEN’s and Sunergy’s ability to effectuate the proposed business combination discussed in this news release; the benefits of the proposed business combination; the future financial performance of the combined company following the transactions; changes in ESGEN’s or Sunergy’s strategy, future operations, financial position, estimated revenues and losses, projected costs, prospects, the ability to raise additional funds prior to the closing of the business combination and plans and objectives of management. These forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this news release, and current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing ESGEN’s or Sunergy’s views as of any subsequent date, and none of ESGEN or Sunergy undertakes any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. As a result of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, ESGEN’s and Sunergy’s actual results or performance may be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include: (i) the timing to complete the proposed business combination; (ii) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the definitive agreements relating to the proposed business combination; (iii) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against ESGEN, Sunergy or others following announcement of the proposed business combination; (iv) the inability to complete the proposed business combination due to the failure to obtain the approval of ESGEN stockholders; (v) the combined company’s success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, its officers, key employees or directors following the proposed business combination; (vi) the combined company’s ability to obtain the listing of its common stock and warrants on the Nasdaq following the proposed business combination; (vii) the risk that the proposed business combination disrupts current plans and operations of Sunergy as a result of the announcement and consummation of the proposed business combination; (viii) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the proposed business combination; (ix) unexpected costs related to the proposed business combination; (x) the amount of any redemptions by public stockholders of ESGEN being greater than expected; (xi) the management and board composition of the combined company following the proposed business combination; (xii) limited liquidity and trading of the combined company’s securities; (xiii) the use of proceeds not held in ESGEN’s trust account or available from interest income on the trust account balance; (xiv) geopolitical risk and changes in applicable laws or regulations; (xv) the possibility that ESGEN, Sunergy or the combined company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; (xvi) operational risk; (xvii) litigation and regulatory enforcement risks, including the diversion of management time and attention and the additional costs and demands on Sunergy’s resources; (xviii) the risks that the consummation of the proposed business combination is substantially delayed or does not occur; and (xix) other risks and uncertainties, including those to be included under the heading “Risk Factors” in the registration statement on Form S-4 (as may be amended from time to time, the “Registration Statement”) filed by ESGEN with the SEC and those included under the heading “Risk Factors” in ESGEN’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the “Annual Report”) and in its subsequent periodic reports and other filings with the SEC. In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should not regard these statements as a representation or warranty by ESGEN, Sunergy, their respective directors, officers or employees or any other person that ESGEN and Sunergy will achieve their objectives and plans in any specified time frame, or at all. The forward-looking statements in this news release represent the views of ESGEN and Sunergy as of the date of this news release. Subsequent events and developments may cause that view to change. However, while ESGEN and Sunergy may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, there is no current intention to do so, except to the extent required by applicable law. You should, therefore, not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing the views of ESGEN or Sunergy as of any date subsequent to the date of this news release._\n\n**_No Offer or Solicitation_** _This news release relates to a proposed business combination between ESGEN and Sunergy.

Announces Updated Transaction Terms for its Pending Business Combination with Sunergy Renewables\n\nJanuary 25, 2024 08:30 ET | Source:  [Esgen Acquisition Corporation](/en/search/organization/Esgen%2520Acquisition%2520Corporation) Follow Esgen Acquisition Corporation\n\nShare\n\nDALLAS and NEW PORT RICHEY, Fla., Jan. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [**ESGEN Acquisition Corp.**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2tdYVkWYCbzexnLcRbwa_ehjLvouOIxPyWizRI_pmOl47VaUelW9JO_sqN26hs9EPS86jaJAdSnRM87ZHeAWvrNZ7b1iVeIzBLyMcPuKQeA=)**(“ESGEN”) (Nasdaq: ESACU, ESAC, ESACW),** a special purpose acquisition company, and [**Sunergy Renewables, LLC**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=DdvtNYZA1V2uY_97MlJZ4cmb0Ts_t1Agp8E771Guujw8Koe8-eA_fDbO3arPhooU_u9y2yd0Z3SShATQxn2441YMHzWYIHfHZKSqL1pdUl0=)**(“Sunergy” or the “Company”),** a leading Florida-based provider of residential solar and energy efficiency solutions, today announced amended transaction terms for its pending business combination (the “Transaction” or the “Business Combination”) that would result in the combined company becoming a publicly listed company on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.\n\nBy the updated terms of the Transaction, ESGEN’s sponsor, ESGEN LLC (the “Sponsor”) has committed to purchase up to $15 million in Convertible Preferred Equity Securities (the “Convertible Preferred Securities”), of which $10 million will be funded at the close of the Business Combination and the remaining $5 million can be funded at the combined company’s discretion up to six months after closing. The purchase of the Convertible Preferred Securities will be funded by Energy Spectrum Partners VIII LP (“Energy Spectrum”). The updated pro forma implied enterprise value of the combined company is expected to be $390 million, and proceeds are expected to be used to fund operations and growth.\n\n“We’re confident that these updated terms will allow Sunergy to hit the ground running in the public markets,” said Sunergy CEO Tim Bridgewater. “With our proprietary, differentiated approach to selling residential solar systems, we’ve demonstrated a strong track record of financial performance and profitability. This amendment to our business combination terms highlights ESGEN’s continued partnership and commitment to supporting our team as we execute our growth strategy in 2024 and beyond.”\n\n“We set out to partner with a stable, innovative, and profitable company, and are confident that our combination with Sunergy will accelerate our path towards being a key player in the residential solar market,” said ESGEN CEO Andrejka Bernatova. “This amendment is an indication of our commitment to Sunergy as a capable partner that will help us achieve our goals, and we look forward to our future with Tim and the Sunergy team.”\n\n“This amendment to our business combination terms represents a significant progression in our partnership with Sunergy,” said ESGEN CFO Nader Daylami. “We believe that these restructured terms position Sunergy to unlock growth both organically and through future M&A moving forward.”\n\nThe amended terms of the Transaction increase the original commitment from Energy Spectrum, in which Energy Spectrum’s participation in the common stock PIPE was agreed to be $10 million at $10.00 per share. In addition, the Sponsor and other insiders agreed to forfeit a total of 2.9 million founder shares at the closing, which will leave 4.0 million founder shares remaining. The amended terms of the Transaction also provide that 500,000 additional founder shares will be forfeited if the Convertible Preferred Securities are redeemed or the Sponsor elects to voluntarily convert them, in each case, within 2 years of closing. Finally, all of the outstanding private placement warrants held by the Sponsor and other insiders will be cancelled at the closing of the Transaction.\n\nAfter the Transaction, the Board of Directors of the combined company will include representatives from both Sunergy and ESGEN. The Board of Directors of ESGEN and the board of managers of Sunergy have unanimously approved the Transaction. The Completion of the proposed Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is anticipated to occur in the first half of 2024.\n\nFounded in 2005 and headquartered in New Port Richey, Florida, Sunergy provides photovoltaic solar and battery-based power as well as storage systems for residential consumers. With the Company’s carefully assembled product portfolio of solar energy systems, energy-efficient appliances, energy storage, insulation, and roofing services, Sunergy seeks to provide a range of benefits to homeowners, including meaningful utility cost savings, superior reliability compared to alternative sources, and energy independence.\n\nESGEN is backed by Energy Spectrum, a well-known energy infrastructure investment firm with a track record of more than 25 years, $4.5 billion of total equity capital commitments, and $1.85 billion of assets under management as of September 30, 2023. The parties believe that the investment track record, operating experience, and strategic insight of Energy Spectrum will serve as a catalyst to enhance the value of the combined company while generating attractive risk-adjusted returns for its shareholders.\n\nFor more information about the proposed Transaction, including a copy of the original Business Combination agreement and the accompanying investor presentation, please visit the ESGEN investor relations website at [esgen-spac.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9RnWuhL0TdyNmFl5BmCzGuVEqJqsTX2_hiMIahxtP5sjXWbz3QxyMT6rSOS7Zmx1UBGBT6Nzpdya5R_OC9zkkw== \"esgen-spac.com\").\n\n**Advisors** Cohen & Company Capital Markets, a division of J.V.B. Financial Group, LLC (“CCM”), served as exclusive financial advisor and lead capital markets advisor to ESGEN. Kirkland & Ellis LLP served as legal counsel to ESGEN and Energy Spectrum. Eversheds Sutherland (US) LLP and Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP served as legal counsel to Sunergy.\n\n**About Sunergy** Sunergy is a Florida-based regional provider of residential solar, distributed energy, and energy efficiency solutions focused on high growth markets with limited competitive saturation. With its differentiated sales approach and vertically integrated offerings, Sunergy serves customers who desire to reduce high energy bills and contribute to a more sustainable future.\n\n**About ESGEN Acquisition Corp.** ESGEN (Nasdaq: ESACU, ESAC, ESACW) is a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities.

The words “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “seek,” “believe,” “project,” “estimate,” “expect,” “strategy,” “future,” “likely,” “may,” “should,” “will” and similar references to future periods may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking.

These forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this news release, and current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing ESGEN’s or Sunergy’s views as of any subsequent date, and none of ESGEN or Sunergy undertakes any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. As a result of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, ESGEN’s and Sunergy’s actual results or performance may be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include: (i) the timing to complete the proposed business combination; (ii) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the definitive agreements relating to the proposed business combination; (iii) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against ESGEN, Sunergy or others following announcement of the proposed business combination; (iv) the inability to complete the proposed business combination due to the failure to obtain the approval of ESGEN stockholders; (v) the combined company’s success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, its officers, key employees or directors following the proposed business combination; (vi) the combined company’s ability to obtain the listing of its common stock and warrants on the Nasdaq following the proposed business combination; (vii) the risk that the proposed business combination disrupts current plans and operations of Sunergy as a result of the announcement and consummation of the proposed business combination; (viii) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the proposed business combination; (ix) unexpected costs related to the proposed business combination; (x) the amount of any redemptions by public stockholders of ESGEN being greater than expected; (xi) the management and board composition of the combined company following the proposed business combination; (xii) limited liquidity and trading of the combined company’s securities; (xiii) the use of proceeds not held in ESGEN’s trust account or available from interest income on the trust account balance; (xiv) geopolitical risk and changes in applicable laws or regulations; (xv) the possibility that ESGEN, Sunergy or the combined company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; (xvi) operational risk; (xvii) litigation and regulatory enforcement risks, including the diversion of management time and attention and the additional costs and demands on Sunergy’s resources; (xviii) the risks that the consummation of the proposed business combination is substantially delayed or does not occur; and (xix) other risks and uncertainties, including those to be included under the heading “Risk Factors” in the registration statement on Form S-4 (as may be amended from time to time, the “Registration Statement”) filed by ESGEN with the SEC and those included under the heading “Risk Factors” in ESGEN’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the “Annual Report”) and in its subsequent periodic reports and other filings with the SEC. In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should not regard these statements as a representation or warranty by ESGEN, Sunergy, their respective directors, officers or employees or any other person that ESGEN and Sunergy will achieve their objectives and plans in any specified time frame, or at all. The forward-looking statements in this news release represent the views of ESGEN and Sunergy as of the date of this news release. Subsequent events and developments may cause that view to change. However, while ESGEN and Sunergy may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, there is no current intention to do so, except to the extent required by applicable law. You should, therefore, not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing the views of ESGEN or Sunergy as of any date subsequent to the date of this news release._\n\n**_No Offer or Solicitation_** _This news release relates to a proposed business combination between ESGEN and Sunergy.
