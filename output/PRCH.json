(“Porch” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: PRCH), a homeowners insurance and vertical software platform, today announced Porch Group Media (“PGM”), the data and marketing subsidiary of Porch, has signed an agreement to license non-exclusively its unique Home Factors insights to California-based insurance MGA, Bamboo Ide8 Insurance Services, LLC. (“Bamboo”). \n\nThis agreement follows the recent announcement of Home Factors’ official third-party launch in the market. Porch Group Media has Home Factors for approximately 90% of US homes, providing unique and valuable insights not previously available. For example, identifying that an electric panel needs repair indicates 41% higher claims frequency. These insights have already demonstrated strong performance with Porch’s own insurance carrier, Homeowners of America Insurance Company (“HOA”), where it has contributed to its improvement in loss ratio performance. \n\nHome Factors provides value for consumers and carriers. Consumers can get fairer prices based on the actual risk of their property and insurance carriers are expected to achieve more accurate pricing and lower underwriting costs. Tests with HOA and other third-party partners such as Bamboo continue to validate Home Factors’ value in underwriting, rate, claims, marketing and overall risk management. Bamboo is among the first to leverage Home Factors insights for a tech-forward and data-driven approach to underwriting, and reduce the cost of manual underwriting. \n\n“Signing our strategic Home Factors partnership with Bamboo is a significant milestone for Porch,” said Michelle Taves, VP & Group GM, Data and Marketing. “This continues to demonstrate the value that Home Factors brings to insurers looking to improve underwriting efficiency and risk assessment through advanced data insights. This agreement marks a key milestone for Home Factors and we are excited about the opportunity to work closely with the innovative team at Bamboo and the impact Home Factors can have on Porch’s future.” \n\n“We’re thrilled to partner with Porch Group Media and have the opportunity to leverage Home Factor’s exclusive data insights to further elevate our risk selection,” said Brian Suzuki, Chief Insurance Officer at Bamboo Insurance. “As a business, we’re always looking for opportunities to crank up our efficiencies. Given Home Factors' ability to provide us with unique property data that directly supports our underwriting processes, this partnership was simply a no-brainer.” \n\n**About Porch Group Media**\n\nPorch Group, Inc.'s data management subsidiary, Porch Group Media (“PGM”), brings extensive expertise in first-party data management and solutions. Dedicated to transforming risk management through advanced technology and data intelligence, PGM provides exclusive insights into a property’s interior and exterior. Leveraging Porch’s comprehensive U.S. property data, the newly launched Home Factors product empowers insurance carriers to assess home conditions, accurately underwrite risk, and price homeowners’ insurance policies more effectively. \n\nFor more information, please visit [Home Factors | Porch Group Media](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fporchgroupmedia.com%2Fproperty-risk-data%2F&esheet=54152505&newsitemid=20241119636655&lan=en-US&anchor=Home+Factors+%7C+Porch+Group+Media&index=1&md5=5a4e2d6df082402827da80faac91cae9). \n\n**About Bamboo**\n\nBamboo is a capital-light, tech- and data-enabled insurance distribution platform providing insurance offerings to the residential property market in California.

You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in\nthis release primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends we believe may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is\nsubject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including those described above and elsewhere in this presentation. We disclaim any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether in response to new information, future events, or otherwise,\nexcept as required by applicable law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis release includes non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA (Loss), and Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) margin, and Free Cash Flow.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) as net income (loss) adjusted for interest expense; income taxes; depreciation and amortization; gain or loss on extinguishment of debt; other expense (income), net; impairments of intangible assets and goodwill; impairments of\nproperty, equipment, and software; stock-based compensation expense; mark-to-market gains or losses recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements, earnouts, warrants, and derivatives; restructuring costs; acquisition and other\ntransaction costs; and non-cash bonus expense. Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) divided by total revenue.Free cash flow is defined as Operating Cash Flow adjusted for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and\ncapitalized software.\nOur management uses these non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures of our operating and financial performance, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, to evaluate financial and strategic planning matters, and to establish certain\nperformance goals for incentive programs. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with useful information to evaluate our operating and financial performance and trends and in comparing our financial results with competitors,\nother similar companies and companies across different industries, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, our definitions and methodology in calculating these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to those used by\nother companies. In addition, we may modify the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures in the future, and any such modification may be material.\nYou should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation, as a substitute to or superior to financial performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude\nspecified income and expenses, some of which may be significant or material, that are required by GAAP to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements.

          "content": "Porch Group Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results\nApplication for Reciprocal Exchange Approved\nStrong Operational Performance Delivers Record Profitability\nSEATTLE, November 7, 2024 (BUSINESS WIRE) – Porch Group, Inc. (“Porch Group” or “the Company”)\n(NASDAQ: PRCH), a homeowners insurance and vertical software platform, today reported third quarter results through\nSeptember 30, 2024, with total revenue of $111.2 million. GAAP net income was $14.4 million, an improvement of\n$20.1 million compared to the prior year, and Adjusted EBITDA was $16.9 million, an improvement of $8.1 million\ncompared to the prior year.\nCEO Summary\n“We are excited by today's update: the important approval of the Reciprocal Exchange formation, record profitability, and\nde-leveraging. The Reciprocal approval has been a long time coming, is a key milestone for Porch, and the culmination of\ntremendous work by the Porch team in partnership with the Texas Department of Insurance. We believe this will be the\noptimal structure for our insurance business, which we expect will result in a higher margin and a more predictable\nfinancial profile and equip our insurance operations to scale profitably in the future. Operational execution was strong and\ndelivered profitability outperformance in the third-quarter. Our insurance business led the way, aided by strong\nunderwriting improvements including the use of our unique property data to assess and price risk of homeowners insurance\npolicies more accurately,” said Matt Ehrlichman, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and Founder. “In addition, we have\nrepurchased $43 million of our unsecured notes in the third quarter, reducing the outstanding balance due in September\n2026.”\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n• Total revenue of $111.2 million, a decrease of (14)% or $18.4 million compared to prior year (third quarter 2023:\n$129.6 million), due to the prior year non-recurring benefit from the cancellation of the Vesttoo related\nreinsurance coverage1. This offset organic growth in the Insurance segment, including a 25% increase in premium\nper policy.\n• Revenue less cost of revenue of $64.1 million, 58% of total revenue (third quarter 2023: $76.6 million, 59% of\ntotal revenue). Vertical Software Segment margin improved ~800bps, driven by price increases and strong cost\ncontrol. In the Insurance Segment attritional losses were better than anticipated, offsetting the two Hurricane\nevents.\n• GAAP net income of $14.4 million, compared to a GAAP net loss of $5.7 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n• Adjusted EBITDA of $16.9 million, a $8.1 million improvement from the prior year (third quarter 2023: $8.8\nmillion), driven by the Insurance segment, SaaS price increases and strong cost control.\n• Gross written premium for the quarter in our Insurance segment was $139 million with approximately 219\nthousand policies in force.\n• $404.5 million cash, cash equivalents, and investments at September 30, 2024.\nThird Quarter 2024 Operational Highlights\n• 21% attritional loss ratio, an improvement from 32% in the prior year, driven by the insurance profitability\nactions.\n• Repurchased $43 million aggregate principal amount of our 2026 unsecured notes for $20 million cash.\n• Launched three new Home Factors as we continue to test which property characteristics correlate to predicting\nlosses and risk.\n• Continue to roll out further product enhancements in Vertical Software, as we increase pricing while maintaining\nhigh customer retention.\n(1) In Q3 2023 Porch discovered that one of the legacy reinsurance partners, Vesttoo, had committed a global fraud and therefore Porch terminated that reinsurance\ncontract and looked for replacement reinsurance. During that time Porch had a period of lower reinsurance ceding that resulted in approximately an additional ~$30\nmillion Revenue, ~$10 million Revenue less Cost of Revenue and ~$2 million Adjusted EBITDA.\n1\nThe following tables present financial highlights of the Company’s third quarter 2024 results compared to the third quarter\nresults of 2023 (dollars are in millions):\nThird Quarter 2024 (unaudited) Insurance Vertical Software Corporate Consolidated\nRevenue $ 79.9 $ 31.3 $ — $ 111.2\nYear-over-year growth (16) % (9)% — % (14) %\nRevenue less cost of revenue $ 38.1 $ 26.0 $ — $ 64.1\nYear-over-year growth (25) % 1 % — % (16) %\nAs % of revenue 48 % 83 % — % 58 %\nGAAP net income $ 14.4\nAdjusted EBITDA (loss) (1) $ 24.8 $ 5.1 $ (13.0) $ 16.9\nAdjusted EBITDA (loss) as a percent of revenue (2) 31 % 16 % — % 15 %\nThird Quarter 2023 (unaudited) Insurance Vertical Software Corporate Consolidated\nRevenue $ 95.2 $ 34.3 $ — $ 129.6\nRevenue less cost of revenue $ 50.7 $ 25.9 $ — $ 76.6\nAs % of revenue 53 % 75 % — % 59 %\nGAAP net loss $ (5.7)\nAdjusted EBITDA (loss) (1) $ 19.0 $ 3.2 $ (13.4) $ 8.8\nAdjusted EBITDA (loss) as a percent of revenue (2) 20 % 9 % — % 7 %\n____________________________________________\n(1) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for the definition and Adjusted EBITDA (loss) table for the reconciliation to GAAP net income (loss)\n(2) Adjusted EBITDA (loss) as a percent of revenue is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA (loss) divided by Revenue\nThe following table presents the Company’s key performance indicators(1).\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n(unaudited) 2024 2023 % Change\nGross Written Premium (in millions) $ 139 $ 154 (10) %\nPolicies in Force (in thousands) 219 334 (34) %\nAnnualized Revenue per Policy (unrounded) $ 1,460 $ 1,139 28 %\nAnnualized Premium per Policy (unrounded) $ 2,208 $ 1,762 25 %\nPremium Retention Rate 100 % 100 %\nGross Loss Ratio 57% 39%\nAverage Companies in Quarter (unrounded) 28,125 30,675 (8) %\nAverage Monthly Revenue per Account in Quarter (unrounded) $ 1,318 $ 1,436 (8) %\nMonetized Services (unrounded) 245,226 225,096 9 %\nAverage Quarterly Revenue per Monetized Service (unrounded) $ 377 $ 510 (26) %\n_____________________________________\n(1) Definitions of the key performance indicators presented in this table are included on page 10 of this release.\n2\nBalance Sheet Information (unaudited)\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(dollars are in millions) 2024 2023 Change\nCash and cash equivalents $ 206.7 $ 258.4 (20%)\nInvestments 197.8 139.2 42%\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments $ 404.5 $ 397.6 2%\nThe Company ended the third quarter of 2024 with cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $404.5 million.

This includes $333.3 million of\nthe 6.75% Senior Secured Convertible Notes due October 2028 (the “2028 Notes”) and $173.8 million of 0.75%\nConvertible Senior Notes due September 2026 (the “2026 Notes”).\nIn the quarter, the Company completed the repurchase of $43.2 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes at an\naverage 47% of par value for $20.2 million of cash.\nPost Balance Sheet Events\nOn October 28, 2024, Porch announced that the Texas Department of Insurance (“TDI”) approved the Company’s\napplication to form and license a reciprocal exchange, subject to customary administrative procedures. The Company\nbelieves this will be an optimal structure for the insurance business, which is expected to result in a more predictable,\nhigher margin and less volatile financial profile for Porch.\nThe Company will form and fund a new reciprocal exchange called Porch Insurance Reciprocal Exchange (“PIRE”). Porch\nwill provide an initial $10 million of funding in exchange for a surplus note. On or around January 1, 2025, Porch expects\nto sell HOA to this entity, and will receive an additional 9.75% plus SOFR (secured overnight financing rate) surplus note\nin exchange. The size of the note will be determined at the time of the HOA acquisition and will be equal to HOA’s surplus,\nwhich Porch expects to be approximately $100 million at year end, less Porch’s existing $49 million surplus note. The\nexpectation is that in total Porch will hold approximately $110 million of surplus notes. HOA will be a subsidiary of PIRE\nand will hold all policies, premiums, and pay claims, commissions, and reinsurance-related expenses.\nAs with all reciprocal exchanges, the entity will in the future be owned by its policyholders. The policyholders provide\nsurplus contributions in addition to the premiums which will grow the reciprocal exchange’s surplus position to fund\noperations and build surplus capital.\nAt Porch, we will have a new Insurance Services Segment which will include Porch Risk Management Services (“PRMS”)\nand Porch Insurance Capital Services (“PICS”). Through PRMS, Porch will operate PIRE, issuing policies and processing\nclaims on its behalf. In return, PRMS will receive commissions and fees. PICS will provide financial solutions for PIRE,\nsuch as holding the surplus note investments.\n3\nFull Year 2024 Financial Outlook\nPorch Group provides full year 2024 guidance based on current market conditions and expectations as of the date of this\nrelease. The Company is revising its full-year 2024 guidance:\n• Revenue in 2024 is expected to grow low single digits. Noting the prior year Revenue included the impact of the\nVesttoo matter in Q3 2023 and the divestiture of EIG in January of this year.\n• Revenue less Cost of Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA guidance have increased, following the profitability\nimprovements in the business.\n• Guidance assumes a 2024 full year loss ratio of 68%. Catastrophic weather further in excess of historical\nexperiences, would create downside to the lower end of the range.\nFull year 2024 guidance is as follows:\nFull Year 2024 Guidance\nRevenue\n$440m to $455m\nGrowth of 2% to 6%\n(Previously: $450m to $470m)\nRevenue Less Cost of Revenue\n$200m to $210m\n(Previously: $190m to $200m)\nAdjusted EBITDA1\n$(7.5)m to $2.5m\n(Previously: $(20)m to $(10)m)\nGross Written Premium2\n$460m to $470m\n(Previously: $460m to $480m)\n1 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure.\n2 2024 gross written premium (“GWP”) guidance is stated as the expected full-year GWP for 2024 and is the total premium written by our licensed\ninsurance carrier(s) (before deductions for reinsurance) and premiums from our home warranty offerings (for the face value of one year’s premium).\nNote, full-year 2023 GWP included approximately $45 million from EIG placed with third party carriers. Post divestiture of EIG, any sales to third-party\ncarriers is no longer included in GWP reporting.\nPorch Group is not providing reconciliations of expected Adjusted EBITDA for future periods to the most directly\ncomparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP because the Company is unable to provide these reconciliations\nwithout unreasonable effort because certain information necessary to calculate such measures on a GAAP basis is\nunavailable or dependent on the timing of future events outside of the Company’s control.\n4\nConference Call\nPorch Group management will host a conference call today November 7, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time (2:00 p.m. Pacific\ntime).

We disclaim any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements,\nwhether in response to new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.\n7\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis release includes non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) as a\npercent of revenue.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) as net income (loss) adjusted for interest expense; income taxes; depreciation and\namortization; gain or loss on extinguishment of debt; other expense (income), net; impairments of intangible assets and\ngoodwill; impairments of property, equipment, and software; stock-based compensation expense; mark-to-market gains or\nlosses recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements, earnouts, warrants, and derivatives;\nrestructuring costs; acquisition and other transaction costs; and non-cash bonus expense. Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) as a\npercent of revenue is defined as Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) divided by total revenue.\nOur management uses these non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures of our operating and financial\nperformance, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, to evaluate financial and strategic planning matters, and to\nestablish certain performance goals for incentive programs. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures\nprovides investors with useful information to evaluate our operating and financial performance and trends and in\ncomparing our financial results with competitors, other similar companies and companies across different industries, many\nof which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, our definitions and methodology in\ncalculating these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to those used by other companies. In addition, we may\nmodify the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures in the future, and any such modification may be material.\nYou should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation, as a substitute to or superior to financial\nperformance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures is that they exclude specified income and expenses, some of which may be significant or material, that are\nrequired by GAAP to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We may also incur future income or expenses\nsimilar to those excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures, and the presentation of these measures should not be\nconstrued as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, these non-\nGAAP financial measures reflect the exercise of management judgment about which income and expense are included or\nexcluded in determining these non-GAAP financial measures.\nYou should review the tables accompanying this release for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the\nmost directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We are not providing reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures\nfor future periods to the most directly comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We are unable to provide\nthese reconciliations without unreasonable effort because certain information necessary to calculate such measures on a\nGAAP basis is unavailable or dependent on the timing of future events outside of our control.\n8\nThe following tables reconcile Net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) for the periods presented (dollar amounts in\nthousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(Unaudited) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income (loss) $ 14,382 $ (5,744) $ (63,303) $ (131,447)\nInterest expense 10,645 10,267 31,758 21,230\nIncome tax provision (benefit) (183) 116 683 34\nDepreciation and amortization 6,049 6,272 18,568 18,501\nGain on extinguishment of debt (22,545) — (27,436) (81,354)\nImpairment loss on intangible assets and goodwill — — — 57,232\nLoss (gain) on reinsurance contract (1) (285) (7,043) (1,391) 41,201\nImpairment loss on property, equipment, and\nsoftware — — — 254\nStock-based compensation expense 6,735 6,979 19,208 20,277\nMark-to-market losses (gains) 1,140 (1,557) 6,538 (1,777)\nOther income, net (2) (773) (1,185) (22,979) (3,525)\nRestructuring costs (3) 1,668 712 3,460 2,789\nAcquisition and other transaction costs 102 22 268 408\nNon-cash bonus expense — — — —\nAdjusted EBITDA (Loss) $ 16,935 $ 8,839 $ (34,626) $ (56,177)\nAdjusted EBITDA (Loss) as a percentage of revenue 15 % 7 % (10) % (18) %\n______________________________________\n(1) See Note 10 in the notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\n(2) Difference from Other Income, net in Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) is\nprimarily due to a portion of the income resulting from the Aon business collaboration agreement, disclosed in Note 10, that is\nnot a non-GAAP adjustment.\n(3) Primarily consists of costs related to forming a reciprocal exchange and share contributions to HOA (see Note 8).\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(Unaudited) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss)\nVertical Software $ 5,138 $ 3,179 $ 11,039 $ 4,599\nInsurance 24,829 19,038 (5,376) (19,328)\nSubtotal 29,967 22,217 5,663 (14,729)\nCorporate and other (13,032) (13,378) (40,289) (41,448)\nAdjusted EBITDA (Loss) $ 16,935 $ 8,839 $ (34,626) $ (56,177)\n9\nThe following table presents Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) as a percentage of segment revenue for the periods\npresented:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(Unaudited) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) as a Percentage of Revenue\nVertical Software 16.4 % 9.3 % 12.1 % 4.7 %\nInsurance 31.1 % 20.0 % (2.2)% (8.9)%\nKey Performance Indicators\nIn the management of these businesses, we identify, measure and evaluate various operating metrics. The key performance\nmeasures and operating metrics used in managing the businesses are discussed below. These key performance measures\nand operating metrics are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States\n(“GAAP”) and may not be comparable to or calculated in the same way as other similarly titled measures and metrics used\nby other companies.\nGross Written Premium — We define Gross Written Premium as the total premium written by our licensed insurance\ncarrier(s) (before deductions for reinsurance); premiums from our home warranty offerings (for the face value of one year’s\npremium); and premiums of policies placed with third-party insurance companies for which we earn a commission.\nPolicies in Force — We define Policies in Force as the number of in-force policies at the end of the period for the\nInsurance segment, including policies and warranties written by us and policies and warranties written by third parties for\nwhich we earn a commission.\nAnnualized Revenue per Policy — We define Annualized Revenue per Policy as quarterly revenue for the Insurance\nsegment, divided by the number of Policies in Force in the Insurance segment, multiplied by four.\nAnnualized Premium per Policy — We define Annualized Premium per Policy as the total direct earned premium for\nHOA, our insurance carrier, divided by the number of active insurance policies at the end of the period, multiplied by four.\nPremium Retention Rate — We define Premium Retention Rate as the ratio of our insurance carrier’s renewed premiums\nover the last four quarters to base premiums, which is the sum of the preceding year’s premiums that either renewed or\nexpired.\nGross Loss Ratio — We define Gross Loss Ratio as our insurance carrier’s gross losses divided by the gross earned\npremium for the respective period on an accident year basis.\nAverage Companies in Quarter — We define Average Companies in Quarter as the straight-line average of the number of\ncompanies as of the end of period compared with the beginning of period across all of our home services verticals that (i)\ngenerate recurring revenue and (ii) generated revenue in the quarter. For new acquisitions, the number of companies is\ndetermined in the initial quarter based on the percentage of the quarter the acquired business is a part of Porch.\nAverage Monthly Revenue per Account in Quarter — We view our ability to increase revenue generated from existing\ncustomers as a key component of our growth strategy. Average Monthly Revenue per Account in Quarter is defined as the\naverage revenue per month generated across all home services company customer accounts in a quarterly period. Average\nMonthly Revenue per Account in Quarter is derived from all customers and total revenue.\nMonetized Services — We connect consumers with home services companies nationwide and offer a full range of\nproducts and services where homeowners can, among other things: (1) compare and buy home insurance policies (along\nwith auto, flood and umbrella policies) and warranties with competitive rates and coverage; (2) arrange for a variety of\nservices in connection with their move, from labor to load or unload a truck to full-service, long-distance moving services;\n(3) discover and install home automation and security systems; (4) compare internet and television options for their new\nhome; (5) book small handyman jobs at fixed, upfront prices with guaranteed quality; and (6) compare bids from home\nimprovement professionals who can complete bigger jobs. We track the number of monetized services performed through\n10\nour platform each quarter and the revenue generated per service performed in order to measure market penetration with\nhomebuyers and homeowners and our ability to deliver high-revenue services within those groups. Monetized Services is\ndefined as the total number of services from which we generated revenue, including, but not limited to, new and renewing\ninsurance and warranty customers, completed moving jobs, security installations, TV/Internet installations or other home\nprojects, measured over the period.\nAverage Quarterly Revenue per Monetized Service — We believe that shifting the mix of services delivered to\nhomebuyers and homeowners toward higher revenue services is an important component of our growth strategy.

(Unaudited)\n(all numbers in thousands, except share amounts and unless otherwise stated)\nNote 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nPorch Group, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, (“Porch Group,” “Porch,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us”) is a leading homeowners insurance\nand vertical software platform and is positioned to be one of the best partners to help homebuyers move, maintain, and fully protect their homes. We offer\ndifferentiated products and services, with homeowners insurance at the center of this relationship.\nWe differentiate and look to win in the massive and growing homeowners insurance opportunity by 1) providing the best services for homebuyers, 2) led by\nadvantaged underwriting in insurance, 3) to protect the whole home.\nAs a leader in the home services software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) space, we’ve built deep relationships with approximately 28 thousand companies that are key\nto the home-buying transaction, such as home inspectors, mortgage companies, and title companies. These relationships provide us with early insights to\nUnited States (“U.S.”) homebuyers. In partnership with these companies, we have the ability to help simplify the move for consumers with services such as\ninsurance, warranty, moving and more.\nWe have two reportable segments that are also our operating segments: Vertical Software and Insurance. See Note 16, Segment Information, for additional\ninformation on our reportable segments.\nThrough our vertical software products we have unique insights into the majority of U.S. properties. This data helps feed our insurance underwriting models,\nbetter understand risk, and create competitive differentiation in underwriting.\nWe provide full protection for the home by including a variety of home warranty products alongside homeowners insurance. We are able to fill the gaps of\nprotection for consumers, minimize surprises, and deepen our relationships and value proposition.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Statements\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Porch Group, Inc., and its subsidiaries. All significant\nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual\nconsolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted\npursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, these unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024. The information as of December 31, 2023, included in the unaudited condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current\nyear’s presentation.\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Quarterly Report”) were prepared on the\nsame basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments (all of which are of a normal recurring\nnature) considered necessary to present fairly our financial position, results of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for\nthe periods and dates presented. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results\nthat may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024, or any other interim period or future year due to various factors such as management estimates\nand the seasonal nature of some portions of our insurance business.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported of\ncertain assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ from\nthose estimates and assumptions.\n8\nTable of Contents\nConcentrations\nFinancial instruments which potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of cash, money market accounts on deposit with financial institutions,\nmoney market funds, certificates of deposit and fixed-maturity securities, as well as receivable balances in the course of collection.\nOur insurance carrier subsidiary has exposure and remains liable in the event of insolvency of its reinsurers. Management and its reinsurance intermediary\nregularly assess the credit quality and ratings of its reinsurer counterparties. As of September 30, 2024, three reinsurers represented more than 10%\nindividually, and 68% in the aggregate, of total reinsurance balance due on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSubstantially all revenues in the Insurance segment are derived from customers in Texas (which represent approximately 71% of Insurance segment revenues in\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024), South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Arizona, and Illinois, which could be adversely affected by economic\nconditions, an increase in competition, local weather events, or environmental impacts and changes.\nNo individual customer represented more than 10% of total consolidated revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, no individual customer accounted for 10% or more of total accounts receivable, net, on the Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we held approximately $205.1 million of cash with five U.S. commercial banks.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. We maintain cash\nbalances that may exceed the insured limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The following table provides the components of restricted cash and\ncash equivalents on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nHeld as collateral by captive reinsurer for benefit of HOA (1) $ 1,062 $ 28,341\nPledged to state departments of insurance (2) 1,201 1,340\nHeld for payment of possible warranty claims (3) 6,687 7,273\nOther 1,000 1,860\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents $ 9,950 $ 38,814\n______________________________________\n(1) Held by our captive reinsurance business as collateral for the benefit of Homeowners of America Insurance Company (“HOA”).\n(2) Pledged to the Department of Insurance in certain states as a condition of our Certificate of Authority for the purpose of meeting obligations to policyholders and\ncreditors.\n(3) Required under regulatory guidelines in 22 states and 19 states as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents to amounts presented in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Cash Flows are as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 206,728 $ 258,418\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents 9,950 38,814\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents $ 216,678 $ 297,232\nAccounts Receivable and Long-term Insurance Commissions Receivable\nAccounts receivable consist principally of amounts due from enterprise customers, other corporate partnerships, and individual policyholders. We estimate\nallowances for uncollectible receivables based on the creditworthiness of our customers, historical trend analysis, and macro-economic conditions.\nConsequently, an adverse change in those factors could affect our estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for uncollectible receivables at\nSeptember 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, was $0.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively.\n9\nTable of Contents\nLong-term insurance commissions receivable consists of the estimated commissions from policy renewals expected to be collected. We record the amount of\nrenewal insurance commissions expected to be collected in the next twelve months as current accounts receivable.\nGoodwill\nWe test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit on an annual basis or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value\nof a reporting unit is below its carrying value. We have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to\nhave occurred. If we can support the conclusion that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we\nwould not need to perform a quantitative impairment test. If we cannot support such a conclusion or we do not elect to perform the qualitative assessment, then\nwe perform a quantitative assessment. If a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment is performed, we utilize a combination of market and income valuation\napproaches. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the reporting\nunit is less than its carrying value. We have selected October 1 as the date to perform annual impairment testing.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions to evaluate the impact of\noperating and macroeconomic changes on each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using a combination of income and market\nvaluation approaches using publicly traded company multiples in similar businesses. Such fair value measurements are based predominately on Level 3 inputs.\nThis analysis requires significant judgments including an estimate of future cash flows which is dependent on internally developed forecasts, estimation of the\nlong-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of\ncapital, which is risk-adjusted to reflect the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully\nrecoverable. Events that trigger a test for recoverability include a significant decrease in the market price for a long-lived asset, significant negative industry or\neconomic trends, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition, a current-period operating or cash flow\nloss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-\nlived asset, or a sustained decrease in share price. When a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed, comparing projected undiscounted\nfuture cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group. If the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, the asset group’s fair value is measured\nrelying primarily on an income approach. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its\nestimated fair value. Management identifies the asset group that includes the potentially impaired long-lived asset, at the lowest level at which there are\nseparate, identifiable cash flows.\nWe estimate the fair value of an asset group using the income approach. Such fair value measurements are based predominately on Level 3 inputs. Inherent in\nour development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business plan forecasts, expected\ngrowth rates, and cost of capital, similar to those a market participant would use to assess fair value. We also make certain assumptions about future economic\nconditions and other data. Many of these factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and these assumptions and estimates may\nchange in future periods.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nWe capitalize deferred policy acquisitions costs (“DAC”) which consist primarily of commissions, premium taxes and policy underwriting and production\nexpenses that are directly related to the successful acquisition by our insurance company subsidiary of new or renewal insurance contracts. DAC are amortized\non a straight-line basis over the terms of the policies to which they relate, which is generally one year. DAC is also reduced by ceding commissions paid by\nreinsurance companies which represent recoveries of acquisition costs. DAC is periodically reviewed for recoverability and adjusted if necessary. Future\ninvestment income is considered in determining the recoverability of DAC. Amortized deferred acquisition costs included in selling and marketing expense,\namounted to $8.2 million and $15.7 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $31.3 million and $34.3 million, for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nExpected Credit Losses\nWe regularly review our individual investment securities for factors that may indicate that a decline in fair value of an investment has resulted from an expected\ncredit loss, including:\n10\nTable of Contents\n• the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events that may affect its operations or earnings;\n• the extent to which the market value of the security is below its cost or amortized cost;\n• general market conditions and industry or sector specific factors;\n• nonpayment by the issuer of its contractually obligated interest and principal payments; and\n• our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of costs.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value principles require disclosures regarding the manner in which fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a three-tiered fair value\nhierarchy into which these assets and liabilities must be grouped, based upon significant levels of inputs as follows:\nLevel 1 Observable inputs, such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;\nLevel 2 Observable inputs, other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices in\nmarkets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term\nof the assets or liabilities; and\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nThe lowest level of significant input determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy. Management’s assessment of the\nsignificance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires management to make judgments and consider factors specific to the asset\nor liability.\nOther Insurance Liabilities, Current\nThe following table details the components of other insurance liabilities, current, on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCeded reinsurance premiums payable $ 41,889 $ 10,500\nCommissions payable, reinsurers and agents 8,141 4,650\nAdvance premiums 18,244 5,975\nFunds held under reinsurance treaty 4,339 9,820\nGeneral and accrued expenses payable 1,140 640\nOther insurance liabilities, current $ 73,753 $ 31,585\nAccounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting--\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires incremental disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments but does not change the\ndefinition of a segment or the guidance for determining reportable segments. The new guidance requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are (1)\nregularly provided to (or easily computed from information regularly provided to) the chief operating decision maker and (2) included in the reported measure\nof segment profit or loss. The new standard also allows companies to disclose multiple measures of segment profit or loss if those measures are used to assess\nperformance and allocate resources. The guidance will first be effective in our annual disclosures for the year ending December 31, 2024, and will be adopted\nretrospectively unless impracticable. Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of assessing the impact of ASU 2023-07 on our disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires disaggregated information about our effective tax\nrate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The new guidance will first be effective in our annual disclosures for the year ending December\n31, 2025, and should be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of assessing\nthe impact of ASU 2023-09 on our disclosures.\n11\nTable of Contents\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures, which\nrequires that public entities disclose, on an annual and interim basis, disaggregated information about specific expense categories (including employee\ncompensation, depreciation, and amortization) presented on the face of the income statement. The guidance will first be effective in our annual disclosures for\nthe year ending December 31, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of assessing the impact of ASU 2024-03 on our disclosures.\nNote 2. Revenue\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table provides detail of total revenue:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nVertical Software segment\nSoftware and service subscriptions $ 18,582 $ 17,307 $ 53,771 $ 51,640\nMove-related transactions 8,311 12,488 24,289 32,503\nPost-move transactions 4,359 4,533 13,280 13,247\nTotal Vertical Software segment revenue 31,252 34,328 91,340 97,390\nInsurance segment\nInsurance and warranty premiums, commissions and policy fees(1)\n79,948 95,228 246,147 218,300\nTotal Insurance segment revenue 79,948 95,228 246,147 218,300\nTotal revenue\n$ 111,200 $ 129,556 $ 337,487 $ 315,690\n______________________________________\n(1)Revenue recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, includes revenue of $73.6 million and $88.2 million, respectively, which is\naccounted for separately from the revenue from contracts with customers. Revenue accounted separately from the revenue from contracts with customers for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was $229.5 million and $193.2 million, respectively.\nDisclosures Related to Contracts with Customers\nTiming may differ between the satisfaction of performance obligations and the invoicing and collection of amounts related to contracts with customers.\nLiabilities are recorded for amounts that are collected in advance of the satisfaction of performance obligations. To the extent a contract exists, as defined by\nASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (“ASC 606”) these liabilities are classified as deferred revenue. To the extent that a contract does not\nexist, as defined by ASC 606, these liabilities are classified as refundable customer deposits.\nInsurance Commissions Receivable\nA summary of the activity impacting the contract assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is presented below:\nContract Assets\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 17,393\nEstimated lifetime value of commissions on insurance policies sold by carriers 1,056\nCash receipts (381)\nValue of commissions sold with business disposition (Note 15) (16,982)\nBalance at September 30, 2024 $ 1,086\n12\nAs of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, $0.2 million and $4.0 million, respectively, of contract assets were expected to be collected within the\nimmediately following 12 months and therefore were included in accounts receivable, net, on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The\nremaining $0.9 million and $13.4 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively, of contract assets are expected to be collected after\nthe immediately following 12 months and were included in other assets on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDeferred Revenue\nA summary of the activity impacting Vertical Software segment deferred revenue balances during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is presented\nbelow:\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 3,715\nRevenue recognized (14,639)\nAdditional amounts deferred 14,816\nBalance at September 30, 2024 $ 3,892\nRevenue recognized for performance obligations satisfied during the nine month ended September 30, 2024, includes $3.7 million that was included in the\ndeferred revenue balances as of December 31, 2023.\nDeferred revenue on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, includes $247.9 million and\n$245.0 million, respectively, of deferred revenue related to the Insurance segment. The portion of insurance premiums related to the unexpired term of policies\nin force as of the end of the reporting period and to be earned over the remaining term of these policies is deferred and reported as deferred revenue.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nThe amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations to be satisfied at a later date, which is not recorded in the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets, is immaterial as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.\nWe have applied the practical expedients not to present unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or\nless, (ii) contracts with variable consideration that is allocated entirely to unsatisfied performance obligations or to a wholly unsatisfied promise accounted for\nunder the series guidance, and (iii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount which it has the right to invoice for services performed.\nWarranty Revenue and Related Balance Sheet Disclosures\nPayments received in advance of warranty services provided are included in refundable customer deposits or deferred revenue based upon the cancellation and\nrefund provisions within the respective agreement. The following table provides balances as of the dates shown.\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nRefundable customer deposits $ 13,054 $ 17,911\nDeferred revenue $ 4,404 $ 3,887\nNon-current deferred revenue (1)\n$ 2,539 $ 2,856\n____________________________________\n(1)Non-current deferred revenue is included in other liabilities in Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred $2.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively, in expenses related to warranty claims.

Of these securities, 68 had been\nin an unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer as of September 30, 2024.\nWe believe there were no fundamental issues such as credit losses or other factors with respect to any of our available-for-sale securities. The unrealized losses\non investments in fixed-maturity securities were caused primarily by interest rate changes. We expect that the securities will not be settled at a price less than\npar value of the investments. Because the declines in fair value are attributable to changes in interest rates or market conditions and not credit quality, and\nbecause we have the ability and intent to hold our available-for-sale investments until a market price recovery or maturity, we do not consider any of our\ninvestments to have any decline in fair value due to expected credit losses at September 30, 2024.\n15\nNote 4. Fair Value\nThe following tables summarize the fair value measurements of assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nFair Value Measurement as of September 30, 2024\nTotal\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value\nAssets\nMoney market mutual funds $ 116,890 $ — $ — $ 116,890\nDebt securities:\nU.S. Treasuries 27,916 — — 27,916\nObligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions — 15,562 — 15,562\nCorporate bonds — 75,489 — 75,489\nResidential and commercial mortgage-backed securities — 66,418 — 66,418\nOther loan-backed and structured securities — 12,393 — 12,393\n$ 144,806 $ 169,862 $ — $ 314,668\nLiabilities\nContingent consideration - business combinations (1) $ — $ — $ 3,367 $ 3,367\nPrivate warrant liability (2) — — 75 75\nEmbedded derivatives (2) — — 35,903 35,903\n$ — $ — $ 39,345 $ 39,345\nFair Value Measurement as of December 31, 2023\nTotal\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value\nAssets\nMoney market mutual funds $ 165,744 $ — $ — $ 165,744\nDebt securities:\nU.S. Treasuries 43,696 — — 43,696\nObligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions — 17,420 — 17,420\nCorporate bonds — 50,041 — 50,041\nResidential and commercial mortgage-backed securities — 24,601 — 24,601\nOther loan-backed and structured securities — 3,418 — 3,418\n$ 209,440 $ 95,480 $ — $ 304,920\nLiabilities\nContingent consideration - business combinations (3) $ — $ — $ 18,455 $ 18,455\nPrivate warrant liability (4) — — 1,151 1,151\nEmbedded derivatives (4) — — 28,131 28,131\n$ — $ — $ 47,737 $ 47,737\n______________________________________\n(1)The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets include $1.4 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and $2.0 million in other liabilities as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, for contingent consideration related to business combinations.\n(2)Private warranty liability and embedded derivatives balances are included in other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(3)The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets include $14.8 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and $3.7 million in other liabilities as of\nDecember 31, 2023, for contingent consideration related to business combinations.\n(4)Private warranty liability and embedded derivatives balances are included in other liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n16\nFinancial Assets\nMoney market mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported by the fund sponsor from an actively traded exchange. As the funds are generally\nmaintained at a net asset value which does not fluctuate, cost approximates fair value. These are included as a Level 1 measurement in the table above. The fair\nvalues for available-for-sale fixed-maturity securities are based upon prices provided by an independent pricing service. We have reviewed these prices for\nreasonableness and have not adjusted any prices received from the independent provider. Level 2 securities represent assets whose fair value is determined\nusing observable market information such as previous day trade prices, quotes from less active markets or quoted prices of securities with similar\ncharacteristics. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2.\nContingent Consideration – Business Combinations\nAs part of the acquisition of Floify, LLC (“Floify”) in October 2021, we issued shares as partial closing consideration to the sellers of Floify and guaranteed\nthat the value of those shares would equal or exceed 200% of such price on or prior to December 31, 2024 (the “True-Up Obligation”). The True-Up Obligation\ncould be settled at our option in cash, Porch common stock, or a combination thereof. On March 27, 2024, we entered into a settlement agreement and mutual\nrelease of claims with the sellers of Floify to settle a post-closing dispute. As part of the of this agreement, the sellers of Floify agreed to terminate the True-Up\nObligation in full and released from restriction approximately $0.9 million of escrowed cash to us. We estimated the fair value of the True-Up Obligation as of\nthe settlement date using the Monte Carlo simulation method. The fair value is based on the simulated market price of our common stock over the maturity date\nof the True-Up Obligation. As of March 27, 2024, the key inputs used to determine the fair value of $14.9 million included the stock price of $4.13, strike price\nof $36.00, discount rate of 23.6% and volatility of 95%. Subsequent to the valuation, we recognized a gain on settlement in other income, net, in the Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss equal to the fair value of $14.9 million. As of December 31, 2023, the key inputs used in the\ndetermination of the fair value of $14.0 million included the stock price of $3.08, strike price of $36.00, discount rate of 27.9% and volatility of 90%.\nWe estimated the fair value of the business combination contingent consideration based on specific metrics related to the acquisition of Residential Warranty\nServices (“RWS”) in April 2022, using the discounted cash flow method. The fair value is based on a percentage of revenue of the contingent consideration\nthrough the maturity date of August 2026. As of September 30, 2024, the key inputs used to determine the fair value of $3.4 million were management’s cash\nflow estimates and the discount rate of 16%. As of December 31, 2023, the key inputs used to determine the fair value of $4.4 million were management’s cash\nflow estimates and the discount rate of 17%.\nPrivate Warrants\nWe estimated the fair value of the private warrants using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. As of September 30, 2024, the key inputs used to\ndetermine the fair value included exercise price of $11.50, expected volatility of 93%, remaining contractual term of 1.23 years, and stock price of $1.54. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the key inputs used to determine the fair value included exercise price of $11.50, expected volatility of 95%, remaining contractual term of\n1.98 years, and stock price of $3.08.\nEmbedded Derivatives\nIn connection with the issuance of senior secured convertible notes in April 2023 (see Note 7) and in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 815-\n15, Derivatives and Hedging – Embedded Derivatives, certain features of the senior secured convertible notes were bifurcated and accounted for separately\nfrom the notes. The following features are recorded as derivatives.\n• Repurchase option. If more than $30 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes remains outstanding on June 14, 2026, the 2028 Note\nholders have the right to require us to repurchase for cash on June 15, 2026, all or any portion of their 2028 Notes, in principal amounts of one\nthousand dollars or an integral number thereof, at a repurchase price equal to 106.5% of the principal amount of the 2028 Notes to be\nrepurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.\n• Fundamental change option. If we undergo a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture governing the 2028 Notes and subject to certain\nconditions, holders of the 2028 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2028 Notes, in principal\namounts of one thousand dollars or an integral multiple thereof, at a repurchase price equal to 105.25% of the principal amount of the 2028\nNotes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. A fundamental change includes events such as a\nchange in control, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, or delisting.\n• Asset sale repurchase option. If we sell assets and receive net cash proceeds of $2.5 million in excess of the Asset Sale Threshold (as defined\nbelow) (such excess net cash proceeds, the “Excess Proceeds”), we must\n17\noffer to all holders of 2028 Notes to repurchase their 2028 Notes for an aggregate amount of cash equal to 50% of such Excess Proceeds at a\nrepurchase price per 2028 Note equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the relevant\npurchase date, if any. “Asset Sale Threshold” means $20.0 million in the aggregate, provided that on and after the date on which the cumulative\nnet cash proceeds received by the Company and its restricted subsidiaries from the sale of assets after April 20, 2023, exceeds $20.0 million in\nthe aggregate, the “Asset Sale Threshold” means $0. As of September 30, 2024, our remaining Asset Sale Threshold was $9.1 million (See Note\n15).\nThe inputs for determining fair value of the embedded derivatives are classified as Level 3 inputs. Level 3 fair value is based on unobservable inputs based on\nthe best information available. These inputs include the probabilities of a repurchase, a fundamental change, and qualifying asset sales, ranging from 1% to\n49%.\nLevel 3 Rollforward\nFair value measurements categorized within Level 3 are sensitive to changes in the assumptions or methodology used to determine fair value, and such changes\ncould result in a significant increase or decrease in the fair value.\nThe changes for Level 3 items measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs are as follows:\nContingent\nConsideration - Private Warrant\nBusiness Combinations Embedded Derivatives Liability\nFair value as of December 31, 2023 $ 18,455 $ 28,131 $ 1,151\nSettlements (14,930) — —\nChange in fair value, loss (gain) included in net loss(1) (158) 7,772 (1,076)\nFair value as of September 30, 2024 $ 3,367 $ 35,903 $ 75\nContingent\nContingent Consideration - Private Warrant\nConsideration - Earnout Business Combinations Embedded Derivatives Liability\nFair value as of December 31, 2022 $ 44 $ 24,546 $ — $ 707\nAdditions — — 23,870 —\nSettlements — (420) — —\nChange in fair value, loss (gain) included in net loss(1) — (3,597) 2,440 (620)\nFair value as of September 30, 2023 $ 44 $ 20,529 $ 26,310 $ 87\n______________________________________\n(1) Changes in fair value of contingent consideration related to business combinations are included in general and administrative expenses in the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations. Changes in fair value of the private warrant liability and embedded derivatives are included in other income, net, in the unaudited\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nFair Value of Fixed Rate Debt\nAs of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the 2026 Notes (see Note 7) was $83.0 million and $73.1 million, respectively. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the 2028 Notes (see Note 7) was $185.0 million and $196.7 million, respectively. The fair value\nof the other notes approximate the unpaid principal balance. All debt, other than the convertible notes which are Level 2, is considered a Level 3 measurement.\n18\nNote 5. Property, Equipment, and Software\nProperty, equipment, and software, net, consists of the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nSoftware and computer equipment $ 8,361 $ 8,340\nFurniture, office equipment, and other 1,341 1,573\nInternally developed software 31,733 24,526\nLeasehold improvements 928 1,176\n42,363 35,615\nLess: Accumulated depreciation and amortization (21,222) (18,754)\nProperty, equipment, and software, net $ 21,141 $ 16,861\nDepreciation and amortization expense related to property, equipment, and software was $1.5 million and $1.4 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $4.6 million and $3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nNote 6. Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are stated at cost or acquisition-date fair value less accumulated amortization and impairment. The following tables summarize intangible\nasset balances.\nWeighted Accumulated\nAverage Intangible Amortization Intangible\nUseful Life Assets, And Assets,\nAs of September 30, 2024 (in years) gross Impairment Net\nCustomer relationships 9.0 $ 69,024 $ (30,471) $ 38,553\nAcquired technology 5.0 28,001 (18,947) 9,054\nTrademarks and tradenames 11.0 23,443 (8,208) 15,235\nNon-compete agreements 5.0 301 (173) 128\nRenewal rights 6.0 9,734 (4,391) 5,343\nInsurance licenses Indefinite 4,960 — 4,960\nTotal intangible assets $ 135,463 $ (62,190) $ 73,273\nWeighted Accumulated\nAverage Intangible Amortization Intangible\nUseful Life Assets, And Assets,\nAs of December 31, 2023 (in years) gross Impairment Net\nCustomer relationships 8.0 $ 69,504 $ (24,153) $ 45,351\nAcquired technology 5.0 36,041 (22,358) 13,683\nTrademarks and tradenames 11.0 23,443 (6,701) 16,742\nNon-compete agreements 3.0 616 (455) 161\nValue of business acquired 1.0 400 (400) —\nRenewal rights 6.0 9,734 (3,415) 6,319\nInsurance licenses Indefinite 4,960 — 4,960\nTotal intangible assets $ 144,698 $ (57,482) $ 87,216\nThe aggregate amortization expense related to intangibles was $4.5 million and $4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and $13.9 million and $14.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n19\nGoodwill\nThe goodwill balance at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, was $191.9 million and is entirely included in our Vertical Software segment. We had no\nchanges in the carrying amount of goodwill for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nNote 7. Debt\nThe following tables summarize outstanding debt as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.\nUnamortized Debt Issuance Costs & Carrying\nPrincipal Discount Value\nConvertible senior notes, due 2026 $ 173,771 $ (1,850) $ 171,921\nConvertible senior notes, due 2028 333,334 (106,370) 226,964\nOther notes 150 (3) 147\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 $ 507,255 $ (108,223) $ 399,032\nUnamortized Debt Issuance Costs & Carrying\nPrincipal Discount Value\nConvertible senior notes, due 2026 $ 225,000 $ (3,311) $ 221,689\nConvertible senior notes, due 2028 333,334 (119,665) 213,669\nAdvance funding arrangement 94 — 94\nOther notes 300 (13) 287\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 558,728 $ (122,989) $ 435,739\nConvertible Senior Notes\nInterest expense for our convertible senior notes includes both contractual interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs and discount. The following\ntable details interest expense recognized for the 0.75% convertible senior notes due in September 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) and 6.75% convertible senior notes\ndue in October 2028 (the “2028 Notes”):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nContractual interest expense for 2026 Notes $ 399 $ 422 $ 1,220 $ 1,720\nContractual interest expense for 2028 Notes 5,625 5,625 16,875 10,063\nAmortization of debt issuance costs and discount for 2026 Notes 295 299 882 1,215\nAmortization of debt issuance costs and discount for 2028 Notes 4,711 3,914 13,295 6,713\n$ 11,030 $11,030 $ 10,260 $ 32,272 $ 19,711\nThe effective interest rates for the 2026 Notes and 2028 Notes are 1.3% and 17.9%, respectively.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we capitalized $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of interest expense on the 2028 Notes\nrelated to ongoing internally developed software projects.\nIn February 2024, we repurchased $8.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes. We paid $3.0 million, or 37.5% of par value, plus accrued\ninterest. We recognized a $4.9 million gain on extinguishment of debt, calculated as the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount\nof the portion of the 2026 Notes that was extinguished.\nIn September 2024, we repurchased $43.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes. We paid $20.2 million, or an average of 46.8% of par value,\nplus accrued interest. We recognized a $22.5 million gain on extinguishment of debt, calculated as the difference between the reacquisition price and the net\ncarrying amount of the portion of the 2026 Notes that was extinguished.\n20\nAdvance Funding Arrangement\nFor certain home warranty contracts, we participated in financing arrangements with third-party financers that provided us with the contract premium upfront,\nless a financing fee. Third-party financers collected installment payments from the warranty contract customer which satisfied our repayment obligation over a\nportion of the contract term. We remained obligated to repay the third-party financer if a customer cancels its warranty contract prior to full repayment of the\nadvance funding amount we received. As part of the arrangement, we paid financing fees, which were collected by the third-party financers upfront and were\ninitially recognized as a debt discount. Financing fees were amortized as interest expense under the effective interest method. The implied interest rate varied\nper contract and was generally approximately 14% of total funding received. As of September 30, 2024, our obligation was completely satisfied with the third-\nparty financers, and we had no outstanding balance.\nNote 8. Stockholders' Equity and Warrants\nCommon Shares Outstanding and Common Stock Equivalents\nThe following table shows the number of our common shares that could be issued for each component of our capital structure.\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nOutstanding common shares (1) 118,884 97,061\nCommon shares reserved for future issuance:\nPrivate warrants 1,796 1,796\nStock options (Note 9) 3,231 3,642\nRestricted and performance stock units and awards (Note 9) 14,865 12,065\n2020 Equity Plan pool reserved for future issuance (Note 9) 6,896 8,009\nConvertible senior notes, due 2026 (2) 6,950 8,999\nConvertible senior notes, due 2028 13,332 13,332\nContingently issuable shares in connection with acquisitions (3) — 5,908\nTotal shares of common stock outstanding and reserved for future issuance 165,954 150,812\n______________________________________\n(1) Includes 18.3 million shares of common stock held by HOA as of September 30, 2024.\n(2) In connection with the September 16, 2021, issuance of the 2026 Notes, we used a portion of the proceeds to pay for the capped call transactions, which are expected to generally reduce the\npotential dilution to our common stock. The capped call transactions impact the number of shares that may be issued by effectively increasing our conversion price from $25 per share to\napproximately $37.74, which would result in approximately 5 million potentially dilutive shares instead of the shares reported in this table as of September 30, 2024.\n(3) In connection with the acquisition of Floify, we issued shares as partial closing consideration and guaranteed that the value of those shares would equal or exceed 200% of such price on or prior\nto December 31, 2024. If the value of those shares did not equal or exceed 200% of their value, we would have been obligated to settle any differences in cash, Porch common stock, or\ncombination thereof. On March 27, 2024, we entered into a settlement agreement to settle a post-closing dispute. As part of this agreement, the sellers of Floify agreed to terminate this\nobligation in full.\nWe recently completed a contribution of a total of 18.3 million newly issued shares of our common stock to HOA. The contribution was completed in two\ntransactions: 13.8 million shares on July 31, 2024, and 4.5 million shares on June 26, 2024. This contribution was made to strengthen HOA’s surplus position\nand support the planned transition of our insurance underwriting business, including HOA, to a reciprocal exchange. While the shares contributed to HOA have\nbeen issued and are outstanding, as provided under Delaware law, these shares will neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorom purposes so long as\nHOA (or any successor transferee) holds the shares and is a direct or indirect subsidiary of Porch or is otherwise controlled, directly or indirectly, by Porch. For\naccounting purposes, the shares contributed to HOA are considered treasury stock as of September 30, 2024, because HOA is a subsidiary that is included in\nour consolidated financial results.\n21\nWarrants\nThere was no activity related to private warrants during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31,\n2023, there were 1.8 million private warrants outstanding for common shares. These private warrants are liability classified financial instruments measured at\nfair value, with periodic changes in fair value recognized through earnings and are included in “change in fair value of private warrant liability” in the\nunaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). See Note 4 for more information.\nNote 9. Stock-Based Compensation\nThe following table summarizes the classification of stock-based compensation expense in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\nand Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSelling and marketing $ 732 $ 1,087 $ 2,136 $ 3,028\nProduct and technology 1,413 1,947 3,934 4,650\nGeneral and administrative 4,590 3,945 13,138 12,599\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 6,735 $ 6,979 $ 19,208 $ 20,277\nUnder our 2020 Stock Incentive Plan, employees, directors and consultants are eligible for grants of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock\nappreciation rights, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance restricted stock units (“PRSUs”), and other stock awards,\ncollectively referred to as “Equity Awards.” All Equity Awards granted in 2024 were to employees and directors.\nThe following table summarizes Equity Award activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nNumber of\nNumber of Performance\nNumber of Restricted Restricted\nOptions Stock Units Stock Units\nBalances as of December 31, 2023 3,642 8,310 3,754\nGranted — 4,926 2,569\nVested — (3,521) —\nExercised (328) — —\nForfeited, canceled or expired (83) (1,150) (23)\nBalances as of September 30, 2024 3,231 8,565 6,300\nDuring nine months ended September 30, 2024, we granted PRSUs that have vesting conditions that are based not only on the employee’s service period but\nalso on either revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, or Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) through 2026. The PRSUs will vest, if at all, upon our achieving a specified\ntarget for each vesting condition. The weighted average grant-date fair value of PRSUs granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $5.61.\nTSR will be measured against the total shareholder return of the S&P SmallCap 600 Index during the performance period. The actual number of shares of\ncommon stock to be issued to each award recipient at the end of the performance period will be interpolated between a threshold and maximum payout amount\nbased on actual performance results. A participant will earn 50% of the target number of PRSUs for “Threshold Performance,” 100% of the target number of\nPRSUs for “Target Performance,” and 200% of the target number of PRSUs for “Maximum Performance.” We estimate the grant-date fair value of TSR\nPRSUs using the Monte Carlo simulation model, as the TSR metric is considered a market condition under ASC Topic 718, Compensation - stock\ncompensation.\nNote 10. Reinsurance\n2023 Program\nOur third-party quota share reinsurance program was split into three separate placements to maximize coverage and cost efficiency. The Coastal Program was\neffective for the period April 1, 2023, through March 31, 2024, and covered our\n22\nbusiness in certain Texas coastal regions and the Houston metropolitan area and was placed at 42% of subject property and casualty losses (“P&C losses”), as\nwell as all business in South Carolina which was placed at 7% of P&C losses. The Core Program, which covered the portion of our business not in the Coastal\nProgram, was effective for the period April 1, 2023, through March 31, 2024, and was placed at 9.5% of P&C losses of our remaining business in Texas and\n8% of P&C losses of our business in other states. In addition, the Combined Program was effective for the period January 1, 2023, through March 31, 2024,\nand covered all of our business and was placed at 5% of P&C losses. All programs were subject to certain limits and exclusions, which vary by participating\nreinsurer.\nProperty catastrophe excess of loss treaties were placed on April 1, 2023, and were updated in August 2023 after the events described in the “Terminated\nReinsurance Contract” section below. Coverage for wind storms starts at $20 million per occurrence. Losses are shared between $20 million and $80 million.\nOver $80 million, losses are covered up to a net loss of $440 million. We also place reinstatement premium protection to cover any reinstatement premiums due\non the first four layers.\n2024 Program\nAs of April 1, 2024, our quota share program consists of one combined program covering all of our business in all states and is placed at 27.5% of P&C losses.\nAll programs are effective for the period April 1, 2024, through March 31, 2025, and are subject to certain limits and exclusions, which vary by participating\nreinsurer.\nCoverage for catastrophe events starts immediately within the quota share contracts and at $45.0 million per occurrence within the property catastrophe excess\nof loss treaties placed on April 1, 2024. Losses are shared at various levels up to $75.0 million. Over $75.0 million losses are covered up to a loss of\n$465.0 million. We also place reinstatement premium protection to cover any reinstatement premiums due on the first five layers.\nWe placed a parametric reinsurance contract to cover aggregate severe convective storm losses from January 1, 2024, to January 1, 2025. This contract would\nprovide up to $30.0 million in recovery over $85.0 million in modeled losses.\nReinsurance Impact\nThe effects of reinsurance on premiums written and earned for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nWritten Earned Written Earned\nDirect premiums $ 130,780 $ 103,328 $ 130,952 $ 117,032\nCeded premiums (48,408) (40,855) 30,358 (41,846)\nNet premiums $ 82,372 $ 62,473 $ 161,310 $ 75,186\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nWritten Earned Written Earned\nDirect premiums $ 315,600 $ 314,262 $ 349,365 $ 348,253\nCeded premiums (138,594) (117,736) (34,763) (188,686)\nNet premiums $ 177,006 $ 196,526 $ 314,602 $ 159,567\nThe effects of reinsurance on incurred losses and loss adjustment expense (“LAE”) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were as\nfollows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nDirect losses and LAE $ 53,821 $ 44,273 $ 243,447 $ 271,879\nCeded losses and LAE (14,803) (1,727) (51,346) (115,325)\nNet losses and LAE $ 39,018 $ 42,546 $ 192,101 $ 156,554\n23\nThe detail of reinsurance balances due is as follows:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nCeded unearned premium $ 65,603 $ 50,697\nLosses and LAE reserve 19,682 19,911\nReinsurance recoverable 18,144 12,629\nOther — 345\nReinsurance balance due $ 103,429 $ 83,582\nTerminated Reinsurance Contract\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, HOA discovered that Vesttoo Ltd (“Vesttoo”), which arranged capital for one of our reinsurance contracts, faced allegations\nof fraudulent activity in connection with collateral it provided to HOA and certain other third parties, which allegations have since been confirmed. We\ncommunicated and met with regulators and other key stakeholders regarding the fraud committed and the terminated reinsurance contract. This reinsurance\nagreement provided partial quota share coverage as well as up to approximately $175 million in a catastrophic event.\nAs a result of its findings, and in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance agreement, HOA terminated the associated contract on August 4, 2023, with an\neffective date of July 1, 2023. Had the contract not been terminated, the contract would have expired on December 31, 2023, and HOA would have been\ncontracted to pay approximately $20 million in additional premium payments during July through December 2023. Following the effective date of the\ntermination, HOA seized available liquid collateral in the amount of approximately $47.6 million from a reinsurance trust, of which HOA was the beneficiary\nand recognized a charge of $48.2 million in provision for (recovery of) doubtful accounts in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and\nComprehensive Income (Loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, HOA is evaluating and intends to pursue all available legal claims\nand remedies to enforce its rights under the letter of credit required by the reinsurance agreement in the amount of $300 million as additional collateral. We\nhave been appointed to the statutory committee of unsecured creditors in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of Vesttoo and are pursuing recovery of all losses and\ndamages incurred as a result of terminating the reinsurance agreement due to fraud committed by third parties.\nOn January 19, 2024, we entered into a five-year business collaboration agreement with Aon Corp. and Aon Re, Inc. (\"Aon\"), resulting in payments to us of\napproximately $25 million in January 2024 and additional cash payments through the end of the contract term. Of the cash payments that we have or will\nreceive through the end of the contract term, $8.7 million is non-refundable and immediately recognized in other income, net in the Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). A portion of the remaining amount is potentially refundable to Aon if we breach the agreement,\nincluding if we directly or indirectly place reinsurance with brokers unaffiliated with Aon, subject to customary cure rights. The remaining amount will be\nrecognized in other income, net, over the term of the agreement. As part of this agreement, Aon and Porch also signed a mutual release of claims arising from\nthe Vesttoo fraud. Porch has not released any claims against non-Aon parties related to these matters and intends to vigorously pursue recovery. In addition to\nthis arrangement, we have also received cash recoveries from other parties in the amount of $3.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n24\nNote 11. Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Reserve\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the reserve balances for unpaid losses and LAE, gross of reinsurance, for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024:\nReserve for unpaid losses and LAE at December 31, 2023 $ 95,503\nReinsurance recoverables on losses and LAE at December 31, 2023 (19,808)\nReserve for unpaid losses and LAE reserve, net of reinsurance recoverables at December 31, 2023 75,695\nAdd provisions (reductions) for losses and LAE occurring in:\nCurrent year 194,141\nPrior years (1) (2,040)\nNet incurred losses and LAE during the current year 192,101\nDeduct payments for losses and LAE occurring in:\nCurrent year (130,537)\nPrior years (1) (56,331)\nNet claim and LAE payments during the current year (186,868)\nReserve for losses and LAE, net of reinsurance recoverables at September 30, 2024 80,928\nReinsurance recoverables on losses and LAE at September 30, 2024 (19,682)\nReserve for unpaid losses and LAE at September 30, 2024 $ 100,610\n______________________________________\n(1)Also includes certain charges related to Vesttoo (see Note 10).\nAs a result of additional information on claims occurring in prior years becoming available to management, changes in estimates of provisions of losses and\nloss adjustment expenses were made resulting in a decrease of $2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nNote 12. Other Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table details the components of other income, net, on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest income $ 492 $ 1,179 $ 1,286 $ 3,276\nGain on settlement of contingent consideration — — 14,930 —\nLoss on sale of business — — (5,331) —\nRecoveries of losses on reinsurance contracts 1,274 — 14,768 —\nOther, net 248 6 1,439 249\nOther income, net $ 2,014 $ 1,185 $ 27,092 $ 3,525\nNote 13. Income Taxes\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, were $0.2 million and $(0.1) million, respectively, and the\neffective tax rates for these periods were 1.3% benefit and (2.1)% provision, respectively. Benefit (provision) for income taxes for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, were $(0.7) million and less than $(0.1) million, respectively, and the effective tax rates for these periods were (1.1)% provision\nand\n25\nless than (0.1)% provision, respectively. The difference between our effective tax rates for the 2023 and 2024 periods and the U.S. statutory rate of 21% was\nprimarily due to a full valuation allowance related to our net deferred tax assets.\nNote 14. Commitments and Contingencies\nFrom time to time we are or may become subject to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings initiated by\nusers, other entities, or regulatory bodies. Estimated liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can\nbe reasonably estimated. In many instances, we are unable to determine whether a loss is probable or to reasonably estimate the amount of such a loss and,\ntherefore, the potential future losses arising from a matter may differ from the amount of estimated liabilities we have recorded in the financial statements\ncovering these matters. We review our estimates periodically and make adjustments to reflect negotiations, estimated settlements, rulings, advice of legal\ncounsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter.\nCases under Telephone Consumer Protection Act\nPorch and/or an acquired entity, GoSmith.com, are party to a legal proceeding alleging violations of the automated calling and/or internal and National Do Not\nCall restrictions of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 and a related Washington state law claim. The proceedings were commenced as thirteen\nseparate mass tort actions brought by a single plaintiffs’ law firm in December 2019 and April/May 2020 in federal district courts throughout the United States.\nOne of the actions was dismissed with prejudice and appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. While the appeal was pending, the remaining cases were\nconsolidated in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, where Porch resides. On October 12, 2022, in a split decision, the Ninth\nCircuit Court of Appeals reversed. Following remand, that case was also consolidated with the Western District of Washington action. Plaintiffs then filed a\nmotion for leave to file a second amended complaint, which was granted in part and denied in part. The Second Amended Complaint was filed in July 2023. In\nSeptember 2023, Defendants filed a Motion to Strike the Second Amended Complaint; this motion was denied. Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss was filed on\nFebruary 15, 2024 and is fully briefed and awaiting a decision. The parties have each filed several notices of supplemental authority in support of their\nrespective positions on the pending Motion to Dismiss. The parties’ also filed a required Joint Status Report and Discovery Plan on February 16, 2024.\nDiscovery is stayed until Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is decided. Plaintiffs seek actual, statutory, and/or treble damages, injunctive relief, and reasonable\nattorneys’ fees and costs. The action is at an early stage in the litigation process. It is not possible to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of\nthese disputes, although it is reasonably possible that the outcome of these actions may be unfavorable. Further, it is not possible to estimate the range or\namount of potential loss (if the outcome should be unfavorable). We intend to contest this case vigorously.\nOther\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are (or may become) parties to litigation involving property, personal injury, contract,\nintellectual property and other claims, as well as stockholder derivative actions, class action lawsuits and other matters. The amounts that may be recovered in\nsuch matters may be subject to insurance coverage. Although the results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, neither we nor any\nof our subsidiaries are currently a party to any legal proceedings the outcome of which, we believe, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the\naggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nNote 15. Business Disposition\nOn January 31, 2024, we sold our insurance agency, Elite Insurance Group (“EIG”). The sale price was $12.2 million of which we have received $10.9 million\nin cash and recorded a receivable of $1.2 million as of September 30, 2024. We recorded a loss of $5.3 million in other income, net, in the Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nNote 16. Segment Information\nWe have two reportable segments that are also operating segments: Vertical Software and Insurance. Reportable segments were identified based on how the\nchief operating decision-maker (“CODM”) manages the business, makes operating decisions, and evaluates operating and financial performance. Our chief\nexecutive officer acts as the CODM and reviews\n26\nfinancial and operational information for our reportable segments. Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate discrete financial\ninformation is available and operational results are regularly evaluated by the CODM for the purposes of making decisions regarding resource allocation and\nassessing performance.\nOur Vertical Software segment provides software and services to inspection, mortgage, and title companies on a subscription and transactional basis, while also\nproviding move and post-move services. Software and services were 59% and 59% of total vertical software revenue for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively. Move and post-move services were 41% and 41% of total vertical software revenue for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively. The Vertical Software segment operates as several key businesses, including inspection software and services, title insurance\nsoftware, mortgage software, moving services, mover and homeowner marketing, and measurement software for roofers.\nOur Insurance segment provides consumers with insurance and warranty products to protect their homes, earning revenue through premiums collected on\npolicies, policy fees and commissions. The Insurance segment includes HOA, a wholly owned insurance carrier, other insurance-related legal entities, Porch\nWarranty, and other warranty brands.\nThe following table summarizes revenue by segment.\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nVertical Software $ 31,252 $ 34,328 $ 91,340 $ 97,390\nInsurance 79,948 95,228 246,147 218,300\nTotal revenue $ 111,200 $ 129,556 $ 337,487 $ 315,690\nOur segment operating and financial performance measure is Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss). Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) is defined as revenue less\nthe following expenses associated with each segment: cost of revenue, selling and marketing, product and technology, and general and administrative. Segment\nAdjusted EBITDA (Loss) also excludes non-cash items or items that management does not consider reflective of ongoing core operations.\nWe do not allocate shared expenses to the reportable segments. These expenses are included in the “Corporate and other” row in the following reconciliation.\n“Corporate and other” includes shared expenses such as selling and marketing; certain product and technology; accounting; human resources; legal; general\nand administrative; and other income, expenses, gains, and losses that are not allocated in assessing segment performance due to their function. Such\ntransactions are excluded from the reportable segments’ results but are included in consolidated results.\n27\nThe reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) to consolidated “Operating income (loss)” below includes the effects of corporate and other items that\nthe CODM does not consider in assessing segment performance.\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss):\nVertical Software $ 5,138 $ 3,179 $ 11,039 $ 4,599\nInsurance 24,829 19,038 (5,376) (19,328)\nSubtotal 29,967 22,217 5,663 (14,729)\nReconciling items:\nCorporate and other (13,032) (13,378) (40,289) (41,448)\nDepreciation and amortization (6,049) (6,272) (18,568) (18,501)\nStock-based compensation expense (6,735) (6,979) (19,208) (20,277)\nRestructuring costs (1) (1,668) (712) (3,460) (2,789)\nOther non-operating income (1,241) — (4,113) —\nAcquisition and other transaction costs (102) (22) (268) (408)\nImpairment loss on intangible assets and goodwill — — — (57,232)\nRecovery of (loss on) reinsurance contract (see Note 10) 285 7,043 1,391 (41,201)\nImpairment loss on property, equipment and software — — — (254)\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration (142) 787 158 3,597\nInvestment income and realized gains (3,787) (2,485) (10,957) (4,492)\nOperating income (loss) $ (2,504) $ 199 $ (89,651) $ (197,734)\n______________________________________\n(1) Primarily consists of costs related to forming a reciprocal exchange.\nThe CODM does not review assets on a segment basis.\nAll of our revenue is generated in the United States except for an immaterial amount. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we did not have\nmaterial assets located outside of the United States.\nNote 17. Net Income (Loss) Per Share\nEarnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated using the two-class method unless the treasury stock method results in lower EPS. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing\nnet income or loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. To calculate\ndiluted EPS, basic EPS is further adjusted to include the effect of potentially dilutive stock options, RSUs, PRSUs, RSAs, convertible notes, earnout shares,\nand warrants using the more dilutive result of the treasury stock method or the if-converted method. All potentially dilutive securities are antidilutive to periods\nwith net losses, and basic EPS equals diluted EPS in those periods.\n28\nThe following table summarizes the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) attributable per share to common stockholders for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet income (loss) used to compute net income (loss) per share - basic $ 14,382 $ (5,744) $ (63,303) $ (131,447)\nEffect of dilutive securities: 2026 Notes 694 — — —\nNet income (loss) used to compute net income (loss) per share - diluted $ 15,076 $ (5,744) $ (63,303) $ (131,447)\nDenominator:\nWeighted average shares outstanding used to compute net income (loss) per share\n- basic 100,430 96,367 99,050 95,771\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nRSUs 8,779 — — —\nPRSUs 6,301 — — —\n2026 Notes 8,523 — — —\nWeighted average shares outstanding used to compute net income (loss) per share\n- diluted 124,033 96,367 99,050 95,771\nNet income (loss) per share - basic $ 0.14 $ (0.06) $ (0.64) $ (1.37)\nNet income (loss) per share - diluted $ 0.12 $ (0.06) $ (0.64) $ (1.37)\nThe following table discloses securities that were not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share because to do so would have been antidilutive\nfor the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nStock options 3,231 3,686 3,231 3,686\nRestricted stock units and awards — 8,655 8,565 8,655\nPerformance restricted stock units — 4,056 6,300 4,056\nPublic and private warrants 1,796 1,796 1,796 1,796\nEarnout shares (1) — 2,050 — 2,050\nConvertible debt (2) 13,332 22,331 20,282 22,331\nContingently issuable shares in connection with acquisitions (3) — 24,363 — 24,363\n______________________________________\n(1) Earnout shares expired December 23, 2023, without vesting and were subsequently cancelled.\n(2) In connection with the September 16, 2021, issuance of the 2026 Notes, we used a portion of the proceeds to pay for the capped call transactions, which are expected to generally reduce the\npotential dilution to our common stock. The capped call transactions impact the number of shares that may be issued by effectively increasing our conversion price from $25 per share to\napproximately $37.74, which would result in approximately 5 million potentially dilutive shares instead of the shares reported in this table as of September 30, 2024.\n(3) In connection with the acquisition of Floify, we issued shares as partial closing consideration and guaranteed that the value of those shares would equal or exceed 200% of such price on or prior\nto December 31, 2024. If the value of those shares did not equal or exceed 200% of their value, we would have been obligated to settle any differences in cash, Porch common stock, or\ncombination thereof. On March 27, 2024, we entered into a settlement agreement to settle a post-closing dispute. As part of this agreement, the sellers of Floify agreed to terminate this\nobligation in full.\n29\nTable of Contents\nItem 2.

These key performance measures and operating metrics are not prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and may not be comparable to or calculated in the same way as other similarly titled measures\nand metrics used by other companies.\nThe following table summarizes operating metrics for each of the quarterly periods indicated.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change\nGross Written Premium (in millions) $ 139 $ 154 (10)%\nPolicies in Force (in thousands) 219 334 (34)%\nAnnualized Revenue per Policy (unrounded) $ 1,460 $ 1,139 28 %\nAnnualized Premium per Policy (unrounded) $ 2,208 $ 1,762 25 %\nPremium Retention Rate 100 % 100 %\nGross Loss Ratio 57 % 39 %\nAverage Companies in Quarter (unrounded) 28,125 30,675 (8)%\nAverage Monthly Revenue per Account in Quarter (unrounded) $ 1,318 $ 1,436 (8)%\nMonetized Services (unrounded) 245,226 225,096 9 %\nAverage Quarterly Revenue per Monetized Service (unrounded) $ 377 $ 510 (26)%\nGross Written Premium — We define Gross Written Premium as the total premium written by our licensed insurance carrier(s) (before deductions for\nreinsurance); premiums from our home warranty offerings (for the face value of one year’s premium); and premiums of policies placed with third-party\ninsurance companies for which we earn a commission.\nPolicies in Force — We define Policies in Force as the number of in-force policies at the end of the period for the Insurance segment, including policies and\nwarranties written by us and policies and warranties written by third parties for which we earn a commission.\nAnnualized Revenue per Policy — We define Annualized Revenue per Policy as quarterly revenue for the Insurance segment, divided by the number of\nPolicies in Force in the Insurance segment, multiplied by four.\nAnnualized Premium per Policy — We define Annualized Premium per Policy as the total direct earned premium for HOA, our insurance carrier, divided by\nthe number of active insurance policies at the end of the period, multiplied by four.\nPremium Retention Rate — We define Premium Retention Rate as the ratio of our insurance carrier’s renewed premiums over the last four quarters to base\npremiums, which is the sum of the preceding year’s premiums that either renewed or expired.\n32\nTable of Contents\nGross Loss Ratio — We define Gross Loss Ratio as our insurance carrier’s gross losses divided by the gross earned premium for the respective period on an\naccident year basis.\nAverage Companies in Quarter — We define Average Companies in Quarter as the straight-line average of the number of companies as of the end of period\ncompared with the beginning of period across all of our home services verticals that (i) generate recurring revenue and (ii) generated revenue in the quarter. For\nnew acquisitions, the number of companies is determined in the initial quarter based on the percentage of the quarter the acquired business is a part of Porch.\nAverage Monthly Revenue per Account in Quarter — We view our ability to increase revenue generated from existing customers as a key component of our\ngrowth strategy. Average Monthly Revenue per Account in Quarter is defined as the average revenue per month generated across all home services company\ncustomer accounts in a quarterly period. Average Monthly Revenue per Account in Quarter is derived from all customers and total revenue.\nMonetized Services — We connect consumers with home services companies nationwide and offer a full range of products and services where homeowners\ncan, among other things: (1) compare and buy home insurance policies (along with auto, flood and umbrella policies) and warranties with competitive rates and\ncoverage; (2) arrange for a variety of services in connection with their move, from labor to load or unload a truck to full-service, long-distance moving\nservices; (3) discover and install home automation and security systems; (4) compare internet and television options for their new home; (5) book small\nhandyman jobs at fixed, upfront prices with guaranteed quality; and (6) compare bids from home improvement professionals who can complete bigger jobs. We\ntrack the number of monetized services performed through our platform each quarter and the revenue generated per service performed in order to measure\nmarket penetration with homebuyers and homeowners and our ability to deliver high-revenue services within those groups. Monetized Services is defined as\nthe total number of services from which we generated revenue, including, but not limited to, new and renewing insurance and warranty customers, completed\nmoving jobs, security installations, TV/Internet installations or other home projects, measured over the period.\nAverage Quarterly Revenue per Monetized Service — We believe that shifting the mix of services delivered to homebuyers and homeowners toward higher\nrevenue services is an important component of our growth strategy. Average Quarterly Revenue per Monetized Service is the average revenue generated per\nmonetized service performed in a quarterly period. When calculating Average Quarterly Revenue per Monetized Service, average revenue is defined as total\nquarterly service transaction revenues generated from monetized services.\nRecent Developments\nReciprocal Exchange\nOn July 29, 2024, we filed a new and updated application to form and license a Texas reciprocal exchange (the “Reciprocal”) with the Texas Department of\nInsurance (“TDI”). Our application was approved by the TDI on October 25, 2024, subject to customary administrative closing procedures that are expected to\nconclude this year. We expect to fund the Reciprocal during the fourth quarter of 2024 with a surplus note. We expect to sell HOA to the Reciprocal for an\nadditional surplus note in the first quarter of 2025. Porch will operate the Reciprocal, providing services. The services to be provided include, but are not\nlimited to, all matters related to underwriting, policy renewal, risk management, insurance portfolio management, financial management, and setting\ninvestment guidelines. In addition, Porch will maintain the Reciprocal’s books and records and be responsible for its accounting and financial reporting. In\nexchange for the services to be provided, Porch will receive fees. The Reciprocal will pay all claims and claims adjustment expenses, reinsurance costs, agency\ncommissions, and taxes and license fees. With the TDI approval, we intend to launch Porch Insurance, a new brand and product to be offered by the Reciprocal,\nincluding unique benefits for consumers. There is no impact to our consolidated financials for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nRecoveries of Losses on Terminated Reinsurance Contract\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, HOA discovered that Vesttoo Ltd (“Vesttoo”), which arranged capital for one of our reinsurance contracts, faced allegations\nof fraudulent activity in connection with collateral it provided to HOA and certain other third parties, which allegations have since been confirmed. We\ncommunicated and met with regulators and other key stakeholders regarding the fraud committed and the terminated reinsurance contract. This reinsurance\nagreement provided partial quota share coverage as well as up to approximately $175 million in a catastrophic event.\nAs a result of its findings, and in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance agreement, HOA terminated the associated contract on August 4, 2023, with an\neffective date of July 1, 2023. Had the contract not been terminated, the contract would have expired on December 31, 2023, and HOA would have been\ncontracted to pay approximately $20 million in additional premium payments during July through December 2023. Following the effective date of the\ntermination, HOA seized\n33\nTable of Contents\navailable liquid collateral in the amount of approximately $47.6 million from a reinsurance trust, of which HOA was the beneficiary and recognized a charge of\n$48.2 million in provision for (recovery of) doubtful accounts in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, HOA is evaluating and intends to pursue all available legal claims and remedies to enforce its rights\nunder the letter of credit required by the reinsurance agreement in the amount of $300 million as additional collateral. We have been appointed to the statutory\ncommittee of unsecured creditors in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of Vesttoo and are pursuing recovery of all losses and damages incurred as a result of\nterminating the reinsurance agreement due to fraud committed by third parties.\nOn January 19, 2024, we entered into a five-year business collaboration agreement with Aon Corp. and Aon Re, Inc. (\"Aon\"), resulting in payments to us of\napproximately $25 million in January 2024 and additional cash payments through the end of the contract term. Of the cash payments that we have or will\nreceive through the end of the contract term, $8.7 million is non-refundable and immediately recognized in other income, net in the Condensed Consolidated\nStatements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). A portion of the remaining amount is potentially refundable to Aon if we breach the agreement,\nincluding if we directly or indirectly place reinsurance with brokers unaffiliated with Aon, subject to customary cure rights. The remaining amount will be\nrecognized in other income, net, over the term of the agreement. As part of this agreement, Aon and Porch also signed a mutual release of claims arising from\nthe Vesttoo fraud. Porch has not released any claims against non-Aon parties related to these matters and intends to vigorously pursue recovery. In addition to\nthis arrangement, we have also received cash recoveries from other parties in the amount of $3.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nThere can be no guarantee or assurance that HOA will be successful in obtaining sufficient supplemental coverage. Regardless of whether additional\nsupplemental coverage is obtained, HOA will continue to remain responsible and committed with respect to all claims and claim settlement expenses under its\npolicies, including claims incurred but not yet reported for prior periods and claims and expenses that are no longer subject to the reimbursement rights in favor\nof HOA under the terminated reinsurance contract.\nDebt Repurchase\nIn February 2024, we repurchased $8.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes. We paid $3.0 million, or 37.5% of par value, plus accrued\ninterest. We recognized a $4.9 million gain on extinguishment of debt, calculated as the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount\nof the portion of the 2026 Notes that was extinguished.\nIn September 2024, we repurchased $43.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes. We paid $20.2 million, or an average of 47% of par value,\nplus accrued interest. We recognized a $22.5 million gain on extinguishment of debt, calculated as the difference between the reacquisition price and the net\ncarrying amount of the portion of the 2026 Notes that was extinguished.\nSale of Business\nOn January 31, 2024, we sold our insurance agency, Elite Insurance Group (“EIG”). The sale price was $12.2 million of which we have received $10.9 million\nin cash and recorded a receivable of $1.2 million as of September 30, 2024. We recorded a loss of $5.3 million in other income, net, in the Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nWeather Impact\nLate in the first quarter of 2024, a Texas hailstorm resulted in approximately $16.5 million of gross losses. During the second quarter of 2024, a large\nhurricane-like windstorm affected Houston with straight-line and long-lived winds up to 100 miles per hour. This event resulted in approximately $20.5 million\nof gross losses. This sort of event impacts Houston at this level of severity once in every 10 years. In July 2024, Hurricane Beryl made landfall in Texas as a\ncategory 1 hurricane and impacted the Houston area, where HOA writes policies. Hurricane Beryl resulted in approximately $44.9 million of gross losses. In\nSeptember 2024, Hurricane Helene resulted in approximately $4.6 million of gross losses.\nPorch Common Shares Issued to HOA\nWe recently completed a contribution of a total of 18.3 million newly issued shares of our common stock to HOA. The contribution was completed in two\ntransactions: 13.8 million shares on July 31, 2024, and 4.5 million shares on June 26, 2024. This contribution supports the planned transition of Porch’s\ninsurance underwriting business to a reciprocal exchange and helps to bolster HOA’s balance sheet strength and rating after Texas May weather impacted\nsurplus. In addition, the contribution increases HOA’s long-term surplus position, which better positions HOA for any future third party surplus note capital\nraise, and is expected to support premium growth in 2025 and beyond. Should Porch’s share price increase\n34\nTable of Contents\ngoing forward, this would grow HOA’s surplus, thereby supporting higher premium levels. While this increases HOA’s surplus, there is no impact to the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nKey Factors Affecting Operating Results\nWe have been implementing our strategy as a vertical software platform for the home by providing software and services to approximately 28 thousand pre-\nand-post move home service providers including inspectors, real estate, title, and mortgage companies. Our Insurance segment continues to grow in scale\nthrough both premium growth and geographic expansion. The following key factors affected our operating results in the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024:\n• Non-catastrophe gross loss ratio improved 11 percentage points from the prior year, driven by premium per policy increases and non-renewal of\nhigher risk policies in insurance.\n• We continued our cost savings initiatives by hiring highly qualified individuals to replace external contracting services.\n• Effective April 1, 2024, we combined our three quota share reinsurance programs into one program covering all our business in all states and renewed\nall reinsurance programs.\n• We had cash recoveries on terminated reinsurance contracts of approximately $28 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n• We repurchased $51.2 million of our 2026 senior convertible notes, at an average par value of 45.3%, for $23.2 million during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\n• Launched new Home Factors insights as we continue to test which property characteristics correlate to predicting losses and risk.\n• Continue to roll out further product enhancements in our Vertical Software businesses as we increase pricing while maintaining high customer\nretention.\n• We are approved in 16 states to use our unique data to improve risk accuracy in pricing policies for our customers. This means we can charge a lower\nprice for policies which are low-risk and more accurately price higher risk policies.\n35\nTable of Contents\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024, compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nConsolidated Results\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\n(dollar amounts in thousands)\nRevenue $ 111,200 $ 129,556 $ (18,356) (14)%\nOperating expenses:\nCost of revenue 47,076 52,961 (5,885) (11)%\nSelling and marketing 27,233 40,135 (12,902) (32)%\nProduct and technology 14,559 14,446 113 1 %\nGeneral and administrative 24,875 28,659 (3,784) (13)%\nProvision for (recovery of) doubtful accounts (39) (6,844) 6,805 (99)%\nTotal operating expenses 113,704 129,357 (15,653) (12)%\nOperating income (loss) (2,504) 199 (2,703) (1,358)%\nOther income (expense):\nInterest expense (10,645) (10,267) (378) 4 %\nChange in fair value of private warrant liability 50 260 (210) (81)%\nChange in fair value of derivatives (1,048) 510 (1,558) (305)%\nGain on extinguishment of debt 22,545 — 22,545 N/A\nInvestment income and realized gains, net of investment expenses 3,787 2,485 1,302 52 %\nOther income, net 2,014 1,185 829 70 %\nTotal other income (expense) 16,703 (5,827) 22,530 (387)%\nIncome (loss) before income taxes 14,199 (5,628) 19,827 (352)%\nIncome tax benefit (provision) 183 (116) 299 (258)%\nNet income (loss) $ 14,382 $ (5,744) $ 20,126 (350)%\nRevenue. Total revenue decreased by $18.4 million, or 14%, from $129.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to $111.2 million in the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in revenue was driven by our Insurance segment as a result of higher reinsurance ceding and a reduction in\npolicies in force. Prior year Insurance revenue increased as a result of the cancellation of the Vesttoo-related reinsurance coverage which decreased the impact\nof ceding. This change offset organic growth in the Insurance segment, including a 25% increase in premium per policy.\nCost of revenue. Cost of revenue decreased by $5.9 million, or 11%, from $53.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to $47.1 million in the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily the result of higher reinsurance ceding in the Insurance Segment. As a percentage of\nrevenue, cost of revenue represented 42% of revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 41% in the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nSelling and marketing. Selling and marketing expenses decreased by $12.9 million, or 32%, from $40.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023,\nto $27.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is primarily related to a decrease in the Insurance segment’s variable policy\nacquisition and marketing expenses due to decrease in commission rates, the elimination of expenses in the current year due to the sale of the EIG business in\nthe first quarter as described in Note 15 of the unaudited Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and a decrease in Vertical Software segment\ncosts consistent with the decrease in revenue in that segment. As a percentage of revenue, selling and marketing expenses represented 24% of revenue in the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 31% in the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased by $3.8 million, or 13%, from $28.7 million in three months ended September 30,\n2023, to $24.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to decreases in Insurance segment expenses, including a $1.5 million\ndecrease in professional fees and a one-time $1.2 million guarantee assessment to the TDI that occurred in 2023.\n36\nTable of Contents\nProvision for (recovery of) doubtful accounts. In the second quarter of 2023, we charged to provision for doubtful accounts approximately $48.2 million of\nreinsurance balance due from a reinsurer as described in Note 10 of the unaudited Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. In the third quarter\nof 2023, we reduced the provision for doubtful accounts related to Vesttoo by $7.0 million after experiencing improvement in loss reserves. In the three months\nended September 30, 2024 we continued experiencing improvement in loss reserves and reduced the provision by $0.3 million.\nChange in fair value of private warrant liability. The fair value of the private warrant liability changed less in the three months ended September 30, 2024, than\nin the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our common stock price drove the change and was relatively unchanged during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to a decrease in the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nChange in fair value of derivatives. The fair value of the derivatives decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to increasing in the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023. The value is driven by various factors, including the fair value of the underlying debt and assumptions regarding\ntiming of possible repurchase events. See Note 4 in the unaudited Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGain on extinguishment of debt. In connection with the repurchase of a portion of the 2026 Notes, we recognized a $22.5 million gain on extinguishment of\ndebt during the three months ended September 30, 2024. There was no corresponding debt extinguishment during the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nSee Note 7 in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment income and realized gains, net of investment expenses. Investment income and realized gains, net of investment expenses, were $3.8 million and\n$2.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Total investments balance was $197.8 million at September 30, 2024, and\n$115.4 million at September 30, 2023. A higher investment balance and well as reinvested securities at a higher interest rate were the primary reasons for the\nincreased investment income.\nOther income, net. Other income, net, increased by $0.8 million from $1.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to $2.0 million in the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily due to $1.3 million of recoveries on reinsurance contracts in the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nSegment Results\nSEGMENT REVENUE\nThe following table summarizes revenue by segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nVertical Software segment\nSoftware and service subscriptions $ 18,582 $ 17,307 $ 1,275 7 %\nMove-related transactions 8,311 12,488 (4,177) (33)%\nPost-move transactions 4,359 4,533 (174) (4)%\nTotal Vertical Software segment revenue 31,252 34,328 (3,076) (9)%\nInsurance segment\nInsurance and warranty premiums, commissions and policy fees 79,948 95,228 (15,280) (16)%\nTotal Insurance segment revenue 79,948 95,228 (15,280) (16)%\nTotal revenue $ 111,200 $ 129,556 $ (18,356) (14)%\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, Vertical Software segment revenue was $31.3 million or 28% of total revenue. For the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, Vertical Software segment revenue was $34.3 million or 26% of total revenue. The decrease in Vertical Software segment revenue was\nprimarily driven in our moving business, which exited an unprofitable corporate relocations offering, redirecting focus to higher-margin services. This decline\nand was partially offset by price increase in our SaaS businesses, within software and service subscriptions.\n37\nTable of Contents\nInsurance segment revenue was $79.9 million or 72% of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Insurance segment revenue was $95.2\nmillion or 74% of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly driven by a reduction in policies in force and a\nhigher reinsurance ceding in the current year as a result of the Vesttoo-related reinsurance coverage which decreased the impact of ceding in the prior year. This\nchange offset organic growth in the Insurance segment, including a 25% increase in Annualized Premium per Policy.\nSEGMENT ADJUSTED EBITDA (LOSS)\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) is defined as revenue less the following expenses associated with each segment: cost of revenue, selling and marketing,\nproduct and technology, general and administrative expenses, and provision for doubtful accounts. Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) also excludes non-cash\nitems or items that management does not consider reflective of ongoing core operations. See Note 16, Segment Information, in the notes to the unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report for reconciliations to GAAP consolidated financial information\nfor the periods presented.\nThe following table summarizes Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss):\nVertical Software $ 5,138 $ 3,179 $ 1,959 62%\nInsurance 24,829 19,038 5,791 30 %\nSubtotal 29,967 22,217 7,750 35%\nCorporate and other (13,032) (13,378) 346 (3)%\nAdjusted EBITDA (Loss) $ 16,935 $ 8,839 $ 8,096 92 %\nOur Insurance segment had a Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) of $24.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, representing 147% of Adjusted EBITDA (Loss)\nfor the same period. The improvement over the same period last year was a result of lower non-catastrophic losses and our insurance profitability actions,\nincluding premium per policy increases of 25%, increasing deductibles, non-renewals of higher risk policies, and introducing coverage exclusions for select\nrisks. These improvements were partially offset by the effects of hurricane Beryl. See Note 10 in the unaudited Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements for tabular presentation of premiums and net losses.\nVertical Software Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) was $5.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, which improved compared to prior year due to pricing\nincreases and strong cost control, including a reduction in workforce and stronger emphasis on our more profitable services in our moving businesses.\n38\nTable of Contents\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024, compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nConsolidated Results\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\n(dollar amounts in thousands)\nRevenue $ 337,487 $ 315,690 $ 21,797 7 %\nOperating expenses:\nCost of revenue 214,566 185,566 29,000 16 %\nSelling and marketing 94,378 107,357 (12,979) (12)%\nProduct and technology 43,210 43,891 (681) (2)%\nGeneral and administrative 75,504 77,267 (1,763) (2)%\nProvision for (recovery of) doubtful accounts (520) 42,111 (42,631) (101)%\nImpairment loss on intangible assets and goodwill — 57,232 (57,232) (100)%\nTotal operating expenses 427,138 513,424 (86,286) (17)%\nOperating loss (89,651) (197,734) 108,083 (55)%\nOther income (expense):\nInterest expense (31,758) (21,230) (10,528) 50 %\nChange in fair value of private warrant liability 1,076 620 456 74 %\nChange in fair value of derivatives (7,772) (2,440) (5,332) 219 %\nGain on extinguishment of debt 27,436 81,354 (53,918) (66)%\nInvestment income and realized gains, net of investment expenses 10,957 4,492 6,465 144 %\nOther income, net 27,092 3,525 23,567 669 %\nTotal other income 27,031 66,321 (39,290) (59)%\nLoss before income taxes (62,620) (131,413) 68,793 (52)%\nIncome tax provision (683) (34) (649) 1,909 %\nNet loss $ (63,303) $ (131,447) $ 68,144 (52)%\nRevenue. The overall 7% increase in year-to-date revenue compared to the same period last year was primarily driven by the 13%, or $27.8 million, increase in\nrevenue in our Insurance segment as a result of an increase in average premium per policy and lower reinsurance ceding partially offset by a reduction in\npolicies in force.\nCost of revenue. The 16% increase in year-to-date cost of revenue was primarily the result of more severe weather in the current period. These were partially\noffset by the decline of our corporate relocation business. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue represented 64% of revenue in the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared with 59% in the same period of 2023.\nSelling and marketing. The 12% decrease in year-to-date selling and marketing expenses compared to prior year is due to a decrease in Vertical Software\nsegment costs consistent with the decrease in revenue in that segment and a decrease in costs in the Insurance segment related to the sale of the EIG business as\ndescribed in Note 15 of the unaudited Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As a percentage of revenue, selling and marketing expenses\nrepresented 28% of revenue in the current year-to-date period compared to 34% of revenue in the same period last year.\nProvision for (recovery of) doubtful accounts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we charged to provision for doubtful accounts approximately\n$41.2 million of reinsurance balance due from a reinsurer as described in Note 10 of the unaudited Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring 2024, we experienced improvement in loss reserves related to Vesttoo of $1.4 million. We had no significant charges to the provision for doubtful\naccounts during 2024.\nImpairment loss on intangible assets and goodwill. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $55.2 million\nin our Insurance segment and a $2.0 million impairment charge on intangible assets in our Vertical Software segment. These impairments followed a sustained\ndecrease in stock price, increased costs due to\n39\nTable of Contents\ninflationary pressures, hardening of the reinsurance markets, volatile weather, and a deterioration of the macroeconomic environment in the housing and real\nestate and insurance industries. There were no impairment losses on intangible assets and goodwill in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nInterest expense. Year-to-date interest expense, increased by $10.5 million, or 50%, from $21.2 million in the same period in 2023. The increase is mainly due\nto interest at a higher weighted average rate on a higher aggregate debt balance after issuance of the 2028 Notes in April 2023. The following table details the\ncomponents of interest expense, on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nContractual interest expense $ 18,096 $ 12,195\nAmortization of debt issuance costs and discount 14,187 8,756\nCapitalized Interest (357) —\nOther (168) 279\nTotal interest expense $ 31,758 $ 21,230\nChange in fair value of derivatives. The fair value of the derivatives changed more in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, than in the three months\nended September 30, 2023, as the current year includes a full nine months of change whereas the prior year includes only the period of time after the 2028\nNotes were issued in April 2023. The value is driven by various factors, including the fair value of the underlying debt and assumptions regarding timing of\npossible repurchase events. See Note 4 in the unaudited Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGain on extinguishment of debt. In connection with the issuance of the 2028 Notes and partial repurchase of the 2026 Notes, we recognized an $81.4 million\ngain on extinguishment of debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized an\n$27.4 million gain on extinguishment of debt related to the partial repurchases of the 2026 Notes. See Note 7 in the unaudited Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nInvestment income and realized gains, net of investment expenses. Investment income and realized gains, net of investment expenses, were $11.0 million and\n$4.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Total investments balance was $197.8 million at September 30, 2024, and\n$115.4 million at September 30, 2023. A higher investment balance was the primary reason for the increased investment income.\nOther income, net. Other income, net, increased by $23.6 million from $3.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $27.1 million in the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024. The increase is due to recoveries of losses on reinsurance contract of $14.8 million and gain on settlement of contingent\nconsideration of $14.9 million. These are offset by loss on sale of EIG business of $5.3 million. See Note 12 in the unaudited Notes to Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for detail of other income, net, for each period presented.\n40\nTable of Contents\nSegment Results\nSEGMENT REVENUE\nThe following table summarizes revenue by segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nVertical Software segment\nSoftware and service subscriptions $ 53,771 $ 51,640 $ 2,131 4 %\nMove-related transactions 24,289 32,503 (8,214) (25)%\nPost-move transactions 13,280 13,247 33 — %\nTotal Vertical Software segment revenue 91,340 97,390 (6,050) (6)%\nInsurance segment\nInsurance and warranty premiums, commissions and policy fees 246,147 218,300 27,847 13 %\nTotal Insurance segment revenue 246,147 218,300 27,847 13 %\nTotal revenue $ 337,487 $ 315,690 $ 21,797 7 %\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Vertical Software segment revenue was $91.3 million or 27% of total revenue. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, Vertical Software segment revenue was $97.4 million or 31% of total revenue. The decrease in Vertical Software segment revenue was\nprimarily driven by the strategic shift to more profitable moving services and the shutdown of our corporate relocation business, within move-related\ntransaction, and was partially offset by price increase in our SaaS businesses, within software and service subscriptions.\nInsurance segment revenue was $246.1 million or 73% of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Insurance segment revenue was $218.3\nmillion or 69% of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is mainly driven by lower reinsurance ceding and as a 25%\nincrease in Annualized Premium per Policy. These were partially offset by a reduction in policies in force.\nSEGMENT ADJUSTED EBITDA (LOSS)\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) is defined as revenue less the following expenses associated with each segment: cost of revenue, selling and marketing,\nproduct and technology, general and administrative expenses, and provision for doubtful accounts. Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) also excludes non-cash\nitems or items that management does not consider reflective of ongoing core operations. See Note 16, Segment Information, in the notes to the unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report for reconciliations to GAAP consolidated financial information\nfor the periods presented.\nThe following table summarizes Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss):\nVertical Software $ 11,039 $ 4,599 $ 6,440 140%\nInsurance (5,376) (19,328) 13,952 (72)%\nSubtotal 5,663 (14,729) 20,392 (138)%\nCorporate and other (40,289) (41,448) 1,159 (3)%\nAdjusted EBITDA (Loss) $ (34,626) $ (56,177) $ 21,551 (38)%\nOur Insurance segment had a Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) of $(5.4) million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $(19.3) million\nin the same period last year. The improvement over the same period last year was a\n41\nTable of Contents\nresult of lower non-catastrophic losses and our insurance profitability actions, including premium per policy increases of 25%, increasing deductibles, non-\nrenewal of higher risk policies, and introducing coverage exclusions for select risks. These improvements were partially offset by the effects of severe weather\nevents. See Note 10 in the unaudited Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for tabular presentation of premiums and net losses.\nVertical Software Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) was $11.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which improved compared to prior year\ndue to pricing increases and strong cost control, including a reduction in workforce and stronger emphasis on our more profitable services in our moving\nbusinesses.\nCorporate expenses were $40.3 million in the current year-to-date period, a $1.2 million decrease from the same period in the prior year due to successful cost\nreduction efforts across the company. Corporate expenses decreased to 12% of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 13% in the\nsame period in the prior year.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis Quarterly Report includes non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) as a percent of revenue.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) as net income (loss) adjusted for interest expense; income taxes; depreciation and amortization; gain or loss on\nextinguishment of debt; other expense (income), net; impairments of intangible assets and goodwill; impairments of property, equipment, and software; stock-\nbased compensation expense; mark-to-market gains or losses recognized on changes in the value of contingent consideration arrangements, earnouts, warrants,\nand derivatives; restructuring costs; acquisition and other transaction costs; and non-cash bonus expense. Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) as a percent of revenue is\ndefined as Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) divided by total revenue.\nOur management uses these non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures of our operating and financial performance, for internal budgeting and\nforecasting purposes, to evaluate financial and strategic planning matters, and to establish certain performance goals for incentive programs. We believe that the\nuse of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with useful information to evaluate our operating and financial performance and trends and in\ncomparing our financial results with competitors, other similar companies and companies across different industries, many of which present similar non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to investors. However, our definitions and methodology in calculating these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to those used by\nother companies. In addition, we may modify the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures in the future, and any such modification may be material.\nYou should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation, as a substitute to or superior to financial performance measures determined in\naccordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude specified income and expenses, some of which\nmay be significant or material, that are required by GAAP to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We may also incur future income or\nexpenses similar to those excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures, and the presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference\nthat future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures reflect the exercise of management\njudgment about which income and expense are included or excluded in determining these non-GAAP financial measures.\n42\nTable of Contents\nThe following table reconciles Net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollar\namounts in thousands).\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income (loss) $ 14,382 $ (5,744) $ (63,303) $ (131,447)\nInterest expense 10,645 10,267 31,758 21,230\nIncome tax provision (benefit) (183) 116 683 34\nDepreciation and amortization 6,049 6,272 18,568 18,501\nMark-to-market losses (gains) 1,140 (1,557) 6,538 (1,777)\nGain on extinguishment of debt (22,545) — (27,436) (81,354)\nImpairment loss on intangible assets and goodwill — — — 57,232\nImpairment loss on property, equipment, and software — — — 254\nStock-based compensation expense 6,735 6,979 19,208 20,277\nLoss (gain) on reinsurance contract (1) (285) (7,043) (1,391) 41,201\nOther income, net (2) (773) (1,185) (22,979) (3,525)\nRestructuring costs (3) 1,668 712 3,460 2,789\nAcquisition and other transaction costs 102 22 268 408\nAdjusted EBITDA (Loss) $ 16,935 $ 8,839 $ (34,626) $ (56,177)\nAdjusted EBITDA (Loss) as a percentage of revenue 15 % 7 % (10)% (18)%\n______________________________________\n(1)See Note 10 in the notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\n(2)Difference from Other Income, net in Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) is primarily due to a portion of the income\nresulting from the Aon business collaboration agreement, disclosed in Note 10, that is not a non-GAAP adjustment.\n(3)Primarily consists of costs related to forming a reciprocal exchange and professional fees related to share contributions to HOA (see Note 8)\nAdjusted EBITDA (Loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $16.9 million, a $8.1 million improvement from Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) of\n$8.8 million for the same period in 2023. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) in 2024 is primarily driven by insurance profitability actions, including\nprice increases implemented over the last year, as well as cost reductions across the business. We are seeing the benefit of prior year investments in sales and\nmarketing and investments in establishing and maintaining the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX”) and other internal controls across IT and\naccounting organizations. These improvements were partially offset by the effects of severe weather events, lower ceding, and the decline of the corporate\nrelocation business in our Vertical Software segment.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $(34.6) million, a $21.6 million improvement from Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) of\n$(56.2) million for the same period in 2023. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) in 2024 is primarily driven by insurance profitability actions,\nincluding price increases implemented over the last year, as well as cost reductions across the business. These improvements were partially offset by the effects\nof severe weather events and the decline of the corporate relocation business in our Vertical Software segment.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $206.7 million and restricted cash and cash equivalents of $10.0 million. Restricted cash and\ncash equivalents includes the following:\n43\nTable of Contents\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nHeld as collateral by captive reinsurer for benefit of HOA (1) $ 1,062 $ 28,341\nPledged to state departments of insurance (2) 1,201 1,340\nHeld for payment of possible warranty claims (3) 6,687 7,273\nOther 1,000 1,860\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents $ 9,950 $ 38,814\n______________________________________\n(1) Held by our captive reinsurance business as collateral for the benefit of Homeowners of America Insurance Company (“HOA”).\n(2) Pledged to the Department of Insurance in certain states as a condition of our Certificate of Authority for the purpose of meeting obligations to policyholders and\ncreditors.\n(3) Required under regulatory guidelines in 22 states and 19 states as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception and have an accumulated deficit at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, totaling $785.4 million and\n$722.1 million, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had $507.3 million and $558.7 million, respectively, of aggregate principal amount outstanding in\nconvertible notes, promissory notes, line of credit, term loan facility, and advance funding arrangement. In February 2024, we repurchased $8.0 million\naggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes. We paid $3.0 million, or 37.5% of par value, plus accrued interest. We recognized a $4.9 million gain on\nextinguishment of debt, calculated as the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the portion of the 2026 Notes that was\nextinguished. In September 2024, we repurchased $43.2 million aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes. We paid $20.2 million, or an average of 47% of\npar value, plus accrued interest. We recognized a $22.5 million gain on extinguishment of debt, calculated as the difference between the reacquisition price and\nthe net carrying amount of the portion of the 2026 Notes that was extinguished.\nBased on our current operating and growth plan, management believes cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024, are sufficient to finance our\noperations, planned capital expenditures, working capital requirements, and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. As our operations evolve\nand we continue our growth strategy, including through acquisitions, we may elect or need to obtain alternative sources of capital, and we may finance\nadditional liquidity needs in the future through one or more equity or debt financings. We may not be able to obtain equity or additional debt financing in the\nfuture when needed or, if available, the terms may not be satisfactory to us or could be dilutive to our stockholders.\nPorch Group, Inc. is a holding company that transacts the majority of its business through operating subsidiaries, including insurance subsidiaries.\nConsequently, our ability to pay dividends and expenses is largely dependent on dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries. Our insurance company\nsubsidiaries are highly regulated and are restricted by statute as to the amount of dividends they may pay without the prior approval of their respective\nregulatory authorities. As of September 30, 2024, our insurance carrier, HOA, held cash and cash equivalents of $150.5 million and investments of $166.0\nmillion.\nWe recently completed a contribution of a total of 18.3 million newly issued shares of our common stock to HOA. The contribution was completed in two\ntransactions: 13.8 million shares on July 31, 2024, and 4.5 million shares on June 26, 2024. This contribution supports the planned transition of Porch’s\ninsurance underwriting business to a reciprocal exchange and helps to bolster HOA’s balance sheet strength and rating after Texas May weather impacted\nsurplus. In addition, the contribution increases HOA’s long-term surplus position, which better positions HOA for any future third party surplus note capital\nraise, and is expected to support premium growth in 2025 and beyond. Should Porch’s share price increase going forward, this would grow HOA’s surplus,\nthereby supporting higher premium levels. While the shares contributed to HOA have been issued and are outstanding, as provided under Delaware law, these\nshares will neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorom purposes so long as HOA (or any successor transferee) holds the shares and is a direct or\nindirect subsidiary of Porch or is otherwise controlled, directly or indirectly, by Porch. For accounting purposes, the shares contributed to HOA are considered\ntreasury stock because HOA is a subsidiary that is included in our consolidated financial results. While this increases HOA’s surplus, there is no impact to the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements.\nInsurance companies in the United States are also required by state law to maintain a minimum level of policyholder’s surplus. Insurance regulators in the\nstates in which we operate have a risk-based capital standard designed to identify property and casualty insurers, or reinsurers, that may be inadequately\ncapitalized based on inherent risks of the insurer’s\n44\nTable of Contents\nassets and liabilities and its mix of net written premium. Insurers falling below a calculated threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action.\nSee Note 10 in the unaudited Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our reinsurance programs.\nWe may, at any time and from time to time, seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt or equity through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity or\ndebt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will be upon such terms and at such\nprices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts\ninvolved may be material.\nThe following table provides a summary of cash flow data for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (5,080) $ 74,898 $ (79,978) (107)%\nNet cash used in investing activities (52,209) (34,203) (18,006) 53 %\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities (23,265) 92,414 (115,679) (125)%\nChange in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (80,554) $ 133,109 $ (213,663) (161)%\nOperating Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $(5.1) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash used in operating activities\nincludes cash outflows to cover losses from severe weather during the year and timing of working capital disbursements. These outflows of cash were partially\noffset by positive cash flow from the non-recurring cash receipt of $25 million related to the Aon agreement (see Note 10 in the notes to the unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements).\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $74.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by (used in) operating\nactivities consists of net loss of $131.4 million, adjusted for non-cash items and the effect of changes in working capital. Non-cash adjustments include\nimpairment loss on goodwill and intangible assets of $57.2 million, stock-based compensation expense of $20.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $18.5\nmillion, non-cash interest expense of $20.2 million, loss (gain) on remeasurement of contingent consideration of $(3.6) million, and loss (gain) on\nremeasurement of private warrant liability of $(0.6) million. Net changes in working capital were net proceeds of cash of $130.1 million, primarily due to\nincreases in deferred revenue, losses and loss adjustment expense reserves and other insurance liabilities, offset by higher reinsurance balance due.\nInvesting Cash Flows\nNet cash used in investing activities was $52.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash used in investing activities is primarily related\nto proceeds from sale of EIG of $10.9 million and maturities and sales of investments of $44.0 million offset by purchases of investments of $98.1 million and\ninvestments in developing internal-use software of $8.6 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $34.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in investing activities is primarily related\nto acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $2.0 million, purchases of investments of $59.9 million, investments in developing internal-use software of $6.9 million,\nand purchases of property and equipment of $0.8 million. This was offset by the cash inflows related to maturities and sales of investments of $35.3 million.\nFinancing Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(23.3) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Net cash provided by (used in)\nfinancing activities is primarily related to the repurchase of the 2026 Notes of $23.2 million.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $92.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by financing activities\nis primarily related to proceeds from issuance of the 2028 Notes of $112.1 million offset by $5.6 million of stock repurchases.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur critical accounting policies, including the assumptions and judgements underlying them, are disclosed in the 2023 Annual Report, including those policies\nas discussed in Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements include in\n45\nTable of Contents\nthe 2023 Annual Report. There have been no material changes to these policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSince the date of incorporation, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission (the “SEC”).\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including the effects of changes in interest rates, and inflation, as well as risks to the availability of\nfunding sources, hazard events, and specific asset risks.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe market risk inherent in our financial instruments and financial position represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we have interest-bearing debt of $507.3 million and $558.7 million, respectively. Our 0.75% convertible senior\nnotes due in September 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) have a principal balance of $173.8 million as of September 30, 2024, a fixed coupon rate of 0.75%, and an\neffective interest rate of 1.3%. Our 6.75% senior secured convertible notes due in October 2028 (the “2028 Notes”) have a principal balance of $333.3 million\nas of September 30, 2024, a fixed coupon rate of 6.75%, and an effective interest rate of 17.9%. Interest expense includes both contractual interest expense and\namortization of debt issuance costs and discount. The following table details the interest expense recognized for both the 2026 and 2028 Notes:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nContractual interest expense for 2026 Notes 399 422 1,220 1,720\nContractual interest expense for 2028 Notes 5,625 5,625 16,875 10,063\nAmortization of debt issuance costs and discount for 2026 Notes 295 299 882 1,215\nAmortization of debt issuance costs and discount for 2028 Notes 4,711 3,914 13,295 6,713\n11,030 10,260 32,272 19,711\nBecause the coupon rates are fixed, interest expense on the 2026 Notes and the 2028 Notes will not change if market interest rates increase. Other debt as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, totaled $0.2 million and is variable-rate. A 1% increase in interest rates in our variable rate indebtedness would result in a nominal change\nin annual interest expense.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our insurance segment has a $197.8 million portfolio of fixed income securities and an unrealized gain (loss) of $(0.9) million, as\ndescribed in Note 3 in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report. In a rising\ninterest rate environment, the portfolio would result in unrealized losses.\nAs of September 30, 2024, accounts receivable and reinsurance balances due were $21.3 million and $103.4 million, respectively, were not interest-bearing\nassets, and are generally collected in less than 180 days. As such, we do not consider these assets to have material interest rate risk.\nInflation Risk\nWe believe our operations have been negatively affected by inflation and the change in the interest rate environment. General economic factors beyond our\ncontrol and changes in the global economic environment, specifically fluctuations in inflation, including access to credit under favorable terms, could result in\nlower revenues, higher costs, and decreased margins and earnings in the foreseeable future. While we take action wherever possible to reduce the impact of the\neffects of inflation, in the case of sustained inflation across several of the markets in which we operate, it could become increasingly difficult to effectively\nmitigate the increases to costs. In addition, the effects of inflation on consumers’ budgets could result in the reduction of consumer spending habits, specifically\nin the move and post-move markets. If unable to take actions to effectively mitigate the effect of the resulting higher costs, our profitability and financial\nposition could be materially and adversely impacted.\n46\nTable of Contents\nForeign Currency Risk\nThere was no material foreign currency risk for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our activities to date have been conducted primarily in the United\nStates.\nOther Risks\nWe are exposed to a variety of market and other risks, including risks to the availability of funding sources, reinsurance providers, weather and other\ncatastrophic hazard events, and specific asset risks.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the\neffectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n“Exchange Act”)). Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures to\nensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated and\nreported, as applicable, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including the\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures were effective as of September 30,\n2024.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the most\nrecent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Our management recognizes that any\ncontrol system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain judgments and assumptions and cannot provide absolute assurance that its\nobjectives will be met.\n47\nTable of Contents\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nSee Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, in the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this\nQuarterly Report, which is incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 1, for a description of certain litigation and legal proceedings.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are (or may become) parties to litigation involving property, personal injury, contract,\nintellectual property and other claims, stockholder derivative actions, class action lawsuits and other matters. The amounts that may be recovered in such\nmatters may be subject to insurance coverage. Although the results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, neither we nor any of\nour subsidiaries are currently a party to any legal proceedings the outcome of which, we believe, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the\naggregate have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nExcept as set forth below, as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Part 1,\nItem 1A, of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024.\nRegulatory factors could impact the value at which Homeowners of America Insurance Company (“HOA”) carries contributed shares on its statutory\nfinancial statements, negatively impact HOA regulatory surplus, and require us to take additional steps to enable HOA to adhere to regulatory\nrequirements and maintain its financial stability rating.\nAs a Texas domestic property and casualty insurer, HOA is subject to various regulatory requirements, including minimum surplus as regards to policyholders\nand requirements relating to the credit quality, liquidity and diversification of investments. The amount of surplus and investments maintained by HOA also\nimpacts its financial stability rating. Pursuant to the contribution transactions described in Note 8 of the unaudited Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements, a total of 18.3 million shares of common stock were contributed to HOA primarily to support its compliance with requirements under Texas law\nrelating to surplus and to maintain its financial stability rating. The value at which the contributed shares are carried on the statutory financial statements of\nHOA is subject to ongoing regulatory risks, including the following:\n• Valuation of the contributed shares for purposes of HOA statutory financial statements remains subject to continuing oversight by the Texas\nDepartment of Insurance (“TDI”), which may in the future require that the shares be recorded at a more steeply discounted value than TDI initially\napproved depending upon our results of operation and other future events, including excess losses incurred by the HOA insurance business due to\nsevere weather events.\n• Other restrictions under Texas law on the total amount HOA may invest in an affiliate such as Porch Group, Inc., which could limit the portion of the\ncontributed shares’ value that can be included as admitted assets on its statutory financial statements.\nThese and other regulatory factors beyond our control or that we have not anticipated could negatively impact the value at which the contributed shares are\nrecorded on the selling stockholder’s statutory financial statements in future filings with TDI, which could negatively impact the selling stockholder’s surplus\nposition and its Demotech, Inc. financial stability rating. In such event, our strategy to bolster the selling stockholder’s surplus through the contribution of\nshares may prove ineffective, and we may need to contribute cash or other admitted assets or take other steps to enable the selling stockholder to adhere to\nTexas regulatory requirements, including as to surplus, and to maintain its financial stability rating. Our ability to effectively maintain the selling stockholder’s\nsurplus position due to these factors will be subject to numerous risks, such as whether we have sufficient cash or other assets that would count as admitted\nassets of the selling stockholder under Texas insurance law available for additional contributions to the selling stockholder or the availability of additional debt\nor equity financing in the event that we do not. The availability of additional debt or equity financing is subject to numerous risks, including the trading price\nof our common stock at such time, other market conditions, and restrictions under the indentures governing our outstanding convertible senior notes on the\nincurrence of additional indebtedness.\n48\nTable of Contents\nA sustained decline in the price of our common stock would negatively impact HOA regulatory surplus, which may require us to contribute additional\nfunds or shares to enable HOA to adhere to regulatory requirements and maintain its financial stability rating.\nThe shares of our common stock held by HOA represent a significant portion of its surplus as regards to policyholders. The value at which HOA carries these\nshares for regulatory financial reporting purposes will fluctuate over time with changes in the trading price of our common stock. A decline in the trading price\nof our common stock (whether sustained or temporary but at quarter end) would negatively impact the amount of surplus that HOA reports on its statutory\nfinancial statements. It is possible that this could require us to contribute additional funds to enable HOA to adhere to regulatory requirements relating to\nsurplus and to maintain its financial stability rating. In such case, if we do not have sufficient cash resources on hand to fund needed contributions, we may\nneed to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings or contribute additional shares of our common stock instead. Additional equity financings\ncould result in significant additional dilution to existing stockholders, and we face significant restrictions on our ability to obtain additional debt financing due\nto the restrictive covenants under the indentures governing our outstanding convertible senior notes. As a result of these and other factors, additional capital\nmay not be available on terms that are acceptable, if at all, which, if acceptable to TDI, could require us to contribute additional shares of our common stock to\nHOA to enable it to remain in compliance with regulatory requirements and maintain its financial stability rating, which could be delayed if such additional\ncontribution were subject to shareholder approval under applicable Nasdaq listing rules. The contribution of additional shares of common stock to HOA and\nthe possibility that HOA may sell such additional shares could cause the price of our common stock to decline and make it more difficult for us to raise funds\nthrough the sale of equity.\nFuture sales of our common stock by HOA could cause our stock price to decline and be dilutive.\nAlthough HOA holds the shares of common stock described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily to strengthen its surplus position and maintain its\nfinancial stability rating, HOA may sell all or a portion of the shares from time to time in the future as it may deem necessary or appropriate to support the\nneeds of its business, including, for example, to generate additional cash to pay claims and expenses, to improve liquidity and asset diversification, to otherwise\nmeet applicable regulatory requirements and maintain its financial stability rating, or to finance the acquisition of new business. In addition, HOA could be\nforced to sell shares if insurance regulatory authorities disallow the shares to be recorded as admitted assets on its statutory financial statements or require the\nshares to be recorded at a greater discount than initially approved by TDI. Additionally, if HOA is placed under receivership by TDI, the receiver may sell\nshares in connection with the liquidation or rehabilitation of HOA. The timing and amount of any such sales, and the offering price and proceeds thereof,\ncannot be predicted as of the date of this prospectus. Market conditions, the method of distribution and other factors could make it difficult for the selling\nshareholder to sell shares when necessary to meet underlying needs or objectives. The sale of shares of our common stock by HOA in the public market, or the\nperception by the market that those sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Such sales, or the possibility that such sales\nmay occur, also could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through the sale of equity in the future. Once shares are sold by HOA to unrelated parties,\nthey will no longer be treated as treasury shares for financial reporting purposes, may be dilutive to earnings per share, will be entitled to vote and will count\nfor quorum purposes.\nItem 2.

We offer differentiated products and services, with homeowners insurance at the center of this relationship.We differentiate and look to win in the massive and growing homeowners insurance opportunity by 1) providing the best services for homebuyers, 2) led by advantaged underwriting in insurance, 3) to protect the whole home.As a leader in the home services software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) space, we’ve built deep relationships with approximately 28 thousand companies that are key to the home-buying transaction, such as home inspectors, mortgage companies, and title companies.These relationships provide us with early insights to United States (“U.S.”) homebuyers. In partnership with these companies, we have the ability to help simplify the move for consumers with services such as insurance, warranty, moving and more.We have two reportable segments that are also our operating segments: Vertical Software and Insurance. See Note 16, Segment Information, for additional information on our reportable segments. Through our vertical software products we have unique insights into the majority of U.S. properties. This data helps feed our insurance underwriting models, better understand risk, and create competitive differentiation in underwriting. We provide full protection for the home by including a variety of home warranty products alongside homeowners insurance. We are able to fill the gaps of protection for consumers, minimize surprises, and deepen our relationships and value proposition.Unaudited Interim Financial StatementsThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Porch Group, Inc., and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024. The information as of December 31, 2023, included in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Quarterly Report”) were prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments (all of which are of a normal recurring nature) considered necessary to present fairly our financial position, results of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for the periods and dates presented. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024, or any other interim period or future year due to various factors such as management estimates and the seasonal nature of some portions of our insurance business.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported of certain assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.ConcentrationsFinancial instruments which potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of cash, money market accounts on deposit with financial institutions, money market funds, certificates of deposit and fixed-maturity securities, as well as receivable balances in the course of collection.Our insurance carrier subsidiary has exposure and remains liable in the event of insolvency of its reinsurers. Management and its reinsurance intermediary regularly assess the credit quality and ratings of its reinsurer counterparties. As of September 30, 2024, three reinsurers represented more than 10% individually, and 68% in the aggregate, of total reinsurance balance due on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.Substantially all revenues in the Insurance segment are derived from customers in Texas (which represent approximately 71% of Insurance segment revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024), South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Arizona, and Illinois, which could be adversely affected by economic conditions, an increase in competition, local weather events, or environmental impacts and changes.No individual customer represented more than 10% of total consolidated revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, no individual customer accounted for 10% or more of total accounts receivable, net, on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.As of September 30, 2024, we held approximately $205.1 million of cash with five U.S. commercial banks.Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash and Cash EquivalentsWe consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. We maintain cash balances that may exceed the insured limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The following table provides the components of restricted cash and cash equivalents on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets:| September 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nHeld as collateral by captive reinsurer for benefit of HOA (1)| $| 1,062 | $| 28,341   \nPledged to state departments of insurance (2)| 1,201 | 1,340   \nHeld for payment of possible warranty claims (3)| 6,687 | 7,273   \nOther| 1,000 | 1,860   \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents| $| 9,950| $| 38,814  \n  \n______________________________________\n\n(1)Held by our captive reinsurance business as collateral for the benefit of Homeowners of America Insurance Company (“HOA”).\n\n(2)Pledged to the Department of Insurance in certain states as a condition of our Certificate of Authority for the purpose of meeting obligations to policyholders and creditors.\n\n(3)Required under regulatory guidelines in 22 states and 19 states as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nThe reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents to amounts presented in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are as follows:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 206,728| $| 258,418  \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents| 9,950| 38,814  \nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents| $| 216,678| $| 297,232  \n  \nAccounts Receivable and Long-term Insurance Commissions Receivable\n\nAccounts receivable consist principally of amounts due from enterprise customers, other corporate partnerships, and individual policyholders. We estimate allowances for uncollectible receivables based on the creditworthiness of our customers, historical trend analysis, and macro-economic conditions. Consequently, an adverse change in those factors could affect our estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for uncollectible receivables at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, was $0.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively.\n\nLong-term insurance commissions receivable consists of the estimated commissions from policy renewals expected to be collected. We record the amount of renewal insurance commissions expected to be collected in the next twelve months as current accounts receivable.\n\nGoodwill\n\nWe test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit on an annual basis or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. We have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. If we can support the conclusion that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we would not need to perform a quantitative impairment test. If we cannot support such a conclusion or we do not elect to perform the qualitative assessment, then we perform a quantitative assessment. If a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment is performed, we utilize a combination of market and income valuation approaches. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. We have selected October 1 as the date to perform annual impairment testing.\n\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes on each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using a combination of income and market valuation approaches using publicly traded company multiples in similar businesses. Such fair value measurements are based predominately on Level 3 inputs. This analysis requires significant judgments including an estimate of future cash flows which is dependent on internally developed forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital, which is risk-adjusted to reflect the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested.\n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Events that trigger a test for recoverability include a significant decrease in the market price for a long-lived asset, significant negative industry or economic trends, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition, a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset, or a sustained decrease in share price. When a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed, comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group. If the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, the asset group’s fair value is measured relying primarily on an income approach. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. Management identifies the asset group that includes the potentially impaired long-lived asset, at the lowest level at which there are separate, identifiable cash flows.\n\nWe estimate the fair value of an asset group using the income approach. Such fair value measurements are based predominately on Level 3 inputs. Inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business plan forecasts, expected growth rates, and cost of capital, similar to those a market participant would use to assess fair value. We also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions and other data. Many of these factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods.\n\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\n\nWe capitalize deferred policy acquisitions costs (“DAC”) which consist primarily of commissions, premium taxes and policy underwriting and production expenses that are directly related to the successful acquisition by our insurance company subsidiary of new or renewal insurance contracts. DAC are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the policies to which they relate, which is generally one year. DAC is also reduced by ceding commissions paid by reinsurance companies which represent recoveries of acquisition costs. DAC is periodically reviewed for recoverability and adjusted if necessary. Future investment income is considered in determining the recoverability of DAC. Amortized deferred acquisition costs included in selling and marketing expense, amounted to $8.2 million and $15.7 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $31.3 million and $34.3 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nExpected Credit Losses\n\nWe regularly review our individual investment securities for factors that may indicate that a decline in fair value of an investment has resulted from an expected credit loss, including:\n\n•the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events that may affect its operations or earnings;\n\n•the extent to which the market value of the security is below its cost or amortized cost;\n\n•general market conditions and industry or sector specific factors;\n\n•nonpayment by the issuer of its contractually obligated interest and principal payments; and\n\n•our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of costs.\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nFair value principles require disclosures regarding the manner in which fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a three-tiered fair value hierarchy into which these assets and liabilities must be grouped, based upon significant levels of inputs as follows:\n\nLevel 1 Observable inputs, such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;\n\nLevel 2 Observable inputs, other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and\n\nLevel 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n\nThe lowest level of significant input determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy. Management’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires management to make judgments and consider factors specific to the asset or liability.\n\nOther Insurance Liabilities, Current\n\nThe following table details the components of other insurance liabilities, current, on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nCeded reinsurance premiums payable| $| 41,889| $| 10,500  \nCommissions payable, reinsurers and agents| 8,141| 4,650  \nAdvance premiums| 18,244| 5,975  \nFunds held under reinsurance treaty| 4,339| 9,820  \nGeneral and accrued expenses payable| 1,140| 640  \nOther insurance liabilities, current| $| 73,753| $| 31,585  \n  \nAccounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\n\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting--Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires incremental disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments but does not change the definition of a segment or the guidance for determining reportable segments. The new guidance requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are (1) regularly provided to (or easily computed from information regularly provided to) the chief operating decision maker and (2) included in the reported measure of segment profit or loss. The new standard also allows companies to disclose multiple measures of segment profit or loss if those measures are used to assess performance and allocate resources. The guidance will first be effective in our annual disclosures for the year ending December 31, 2024, and will be adopted retrospectively unless impracticable. Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of assessing the impact of ASU 2023-07 on our disclosures.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires disaggregated information about our effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The new guidance will first be effective in our annual disclosures for the year ending December 31, 2025, and should be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of assessing the impact of ASU 2023-09 on our disclosures.\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures, which requires that public entities disclose, on an annual and interim basis, disaggregated information about specific expense categories (including employee compensation, depreciation, and amortization) presented on the face of the income statement. The guidance will first be effective in our annual disclosures for the year ending December 31, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of assessing the impact of ASU 2024-03 on our disclosures.  \n  \n[X](javascript:void\\(0\\);)  \n---  \n[- References](javascript:void\\(0\\);)No definition available.

The unrealized losses on investments in fixed-maturity securities were caused primarily by interest rate changes. We expect that the securities will not be settled at a price less than par value of the investments. Because the declines in fair value are attributable to changes in interest rates or market conditions and not credit quality, and because we have the ability and intent to hold our available-for-sale investments until a market price recovery or maturity, we do not consider any of our investments to have any decline in fair value due to expected credit losses at September 30, 2024.  \n  \n[X](javascript:void\\(0\\);)  \n---  \n[- References](javascript:void\\(0\\);)No definition available.

As the funds are generally maintained at a net asset value which does not fluctuate, cost approximates fair value. These are included as a Level 1 measurement in the table above. The fair values for available-for-sale fixed-maturity securities are based upon prices provided by an independent pricing service. We have reviewed these prices for reasonableness and have not adjusted any prices received from the independent provider. Level 2 securities represent assets whose fair value is determined using observable market information such as previous day trade prices, quotes from less active markets or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2.\n\nContingent Consideration – Business Combinations\n\nAs part of the acquisition of Floify, LLC (“Floify”) in October 2021, we issued shares as partial closing consideration to the sellers of Floify and guaranteed that the value of those shares would equal or exceed 200% of such price on or prior to December 31, 2024 (the “True-Up Obligation”). The True-Up Obligation could be settled at our option in cash, Porch common stock, or a combination thereof. On March 27, 2024, we entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release of claims with the sellers of Floify to settle a post-closing dispute. As part of the of this agreement, the sellers of Floify agreed to terminate the True-Up Obligation in full and released from restriction approximately $0.9 million of escrowed cash to us. We estimated the fair value of the True-Up Obligation as of the settlement date using the Monte Carlo simulation method. The fair value is based on the simulated market price of our common stock over the maturity date of the True-Up Obligation. As of March 27, 2024, the key inputs used to determine the fair value of $14.9 million included the stock price of $4.13, strike price of $36.00, discount rate of 23.6% and volatility of 95%. Subsequent to the valuation, we recognized a gain on settlement in other income, net, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss equal to the fair value of $14.9 million. As of December 31, 2023, the key inputs used in the determination of the fair value of $14.0 million included the stock price of $3.08, strike price of $36.00, discount rate of 27.9% and volatility of 90%.\n\nWe estimated the fair value of the business combination contingent consideration based on specific metrics related to the acquisition of Residential Warranty Services (“RWS”) in April 2022, using the discounted cash flow method. The fair value is based on a percentage of revenue of the contingent consideration through the maturity date of August 2026. As of September 30, 2024, the key inputs used to determine the fair value of $3.4 million were management’s cash flow estimates and the discount rate of 16%. As of December 31, 2023, the key inputs used to determine the fair value of $4.4 million were management’s cash flow estimates and the discount rate of 17%.\n\nPrivate Warrants\n\nWe estimated the fair value of the private warrants using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. As of September 30, 2024, the key inputs used to determine the fair value included exercise price of $11.50, expected volatility of 93%, remaining contractual term of 1.23 years, and stock price of $1.54. As of December 31, 2023, the key inputs used to determine the fair value included exercise price of $11.50, expected volatility of 95%, remaining contractual term of 1.98 years, and stock price of $3.08.\n\nEmbedded Derivatives\n\nIn connection with the issuance of senior secured convertible notes in April 2023 (see Note 7) and in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 815-15, Derivatives and Hedging – Embedded Derivatives, certain features of the senior secured convertible notes were bifurcated and accounted for separately from the notes. The following features are recorded as derivatives.\n\n•Repurchase option. If more than $30 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes remains outstanding on June 14, 2026, the 2028 Note holders have the right to require us to repurchase for cash on June 15, 2026, all or any portion of their 2028 Notes, in principal amounts of one thousand dollars or an integral number thereof, at a repurchase price equal to 106.5% of the principal amount of the 2028 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.\n\n•Fundamental change option. If we undergo a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture governing the 2028 Notes and subject to certain conditions, holders of the 2028 Notes have the right to require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2028 Notes, in principal amounts of one thousand dollars or an integral multiple thereof, at a repurchase price equal to 105.25% of the principal amount of the 2028 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. A fundamental change includes events such as a change in control, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, or delisting.\n\n•Asset sale repurchase option. If we sell assets and receive net cash proceeds of $2.5 million in excess of the Asset Sale Threshold (as defined below) (such excess net cash proceeds, the “Excess Proceeds”), we must \n\noffer to all holders of 2028 Notes to repurchase their 2028 Notes for an aggregate amount of cash equal to 50% of such Excess Proceeds at a repurchase price per 2028 Note equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the relevant purchase date, if any. “Asset Sale Threshold” means $20.0 million in the aggregate, provided that on and after the date on which the cumulative net cash proceeds received by the Company and its restricted subsidiaries from the sale of assets after April 20, 2023, exceeds $20.0 million in the aggregate, the “Asset Sale Threshold” means $0. As of September 30, 2024, our remaining Asset Sale Threshold was $9.1 million (See Note 15). \n\nThe inputs for determining fair value of the embedded derivatives are classified as Level 3 inputs. Level 3 fair value is based on unobservable inputs based on the best information available. These inputs include the probabilities of a repurchase, a fundamental change, and qualifying asset sales, ranging from 1% to 49%. \n\nLevel 3 Rollforward\n\nFair value measurements categorized within Level 3 are sensitive to changes in the assumptions or methodology used to determine fair value, and such changes could result in a significant increase or decrease in the fair value.\n\nThe changes for Level 3 items measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs are as follows: \n\nContingent Consideration - Business Combinations| Embedded Derivatives| Private Warrant Liability  \n---|---|---  \nFair value as of December 31, 2023| $| 18,455 | $| 28,131 | $| 1,151   \nSettlements| (14,930)| — | —   \nChange in fair value, loss (gain) included in net loss(1)| (158)| 7,772 | (1,076)  \nFair value as of September 30, 2024| $| 3,367 | $| 35,903 | $| 75   \n  \nContingent Consideration - Earnout| Contingent Consideration - Business Combinations| Embedded Derivatives| Private Warrant Liability  \n---|---|---|---  \nFair value as of December 31, 2022| $| 44 | $| 24,546 | $| — | $| 707   \nAdditions| — | — | 23,870 | —   \nSettlements| — | (420)| — | —   \nChange in fair value, loss (gain) included in net loss(1)| — | (3,597)| 2,440 | (620)  \nFair value as of September 30, 2023| $| 44 | $| 20,529 | $| 26,310 | $| 87   \n  \n______________________________________\n\n(1)Changes in fair value of contingent consideration related to business combinations are included in general and administrative expenses in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. Changes in fair value of the private warrant liability and embedded derivatives are included in other income, net, in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n\nFair Value of Fixed Rate Debt\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the 2026 Notes (see Note 7) was $83.0 million and $73.1 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the 2028 Notes (see Note 7) was $185.0 million and $196.7 million, respectively. The fair value of the other notes approximate the unpaid principal balance. All debt, other than the convertible notes which are Level 2, is considered a Level 3 measurement.  \n  \n[X](javascript:void\\(0\\);)  \n---  \n[- References](javascript:void\\(0\\);)No definition available.

We paid $3.0 million, or 37.5% of par value, plus accrued interest.

We recognized a $22.5 million gain on extinguishment of debt, calculated as the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the portion of the 2026 Notes that was extinguished.\n\nAdvance Funding Arrangement\n\nFor certain home warranty contracts, we participated in financing arrangements with third-party financers that provided us with the contract premium upfront, less a financing fee. Third-party financers collected installment payments from the warranty contract customer which satisfied our repayment obligation over a portion of the contract term. We remained obligated to repay the third-party financer if a customer cancels its warranty contract prior to full repayment of the advance funding amount we received. As part of the arrangement, we paid financing fees, which were collected by the third-party financers upfront and were initially recognized as a debt discount. Financing fees were amortized as interest expense under the effective interest method. The implied interest rate varied per contract and was generally approximately 14% of total funding received. As of September 30, 2024, our obligation was completely satisfied with the third-party financers, and we had no outstanding balance.  \n  \n[X](javascript:void\\(0\\);)  \n---  \n[- References](javascript:void\\(0\\);)No definition available.

Stockholders' Equity and WarrantsCommon Shares Outstanding and Common Stock EquivalentsThe following table shows the number of our common shares that could be issued for each component of our capital structure.| September 30,2024| December 31,2023  \n---|---  \nOutstanding common shares (1)| 118,884| 97,061  \nCommon shares reserved for future issuance:  \nPrivate warrants| 1,796| 1,796  \nStock options (Note 9)| 3,231| 3,642  \nRestricted and performance stock units and awards (Note 9)| 14,865| 12,065  \n2020 Equity Plan pool reserved for future issuance (Note 9)| 6,896| 8,009  \nConvertible senior notes, due 2026 (2)| 6,950| 8,999  \nConvertible senior notes, due 2028| 13,332| 13,332  \nContingently issuable shares in connection with acquisitions (3)| —| 5,908  \nTotal shares of common stock outstanding and reserved for future issuance| 165,954| 150,812  \n  \n______________________________________\n\n(1)Includes 18.3 million shares of common stock held by HOA as of September 30, 2024. \n\n(2)In connection with the September 16, 2021, issuance of the 2026 Notes, we used a portion of the proceeds to pay for the capped call transactions, which are expected to generally reduce the potential dilution to our common stock. The capped call transactions impact the number of shares that may be issued by effectively increasing our conversion price from $25 per share to approximately $37.74, which would result in approximately 5 million potentially dilutive shares instead of the shares reported in this table as of September 30, 2024.\n\n(3)In connection with the acquisition of Floify, we issued shares as partial closing consideration and guaranteed that the value of those shares would equal or exceed 200% of such price on or prior to December 31, 2024. If the value of those shares did not equal or exceed 200% of their value, we would have been obligated to settle any differences in cash, Porch common stock, or combination thereof. On March 27, 2024, we entered into a settlement agreement to settle a post-closing dispute. As part of this agreement, the sellers of Floify agreed to terminate this obligation in full.\n\nWe recently completed a contribution of a total of 18.3 million newly issued shares of our common stock to HOA. The contribution was completed in two transactions: 13.8 million shares on July 31, 2024, and 4.5 million shares on June 26, 2024. This contribution was made to strengthen HOA’s surplus position and support the planned transition of our insurance underwriting business, including HOA, to a reciprocal exchange. While the shares contributed to HOA have been issued and are outstanding, as provided under Delaware law, these shares will neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorom purposes so long as HOA (or any successor transferee) holds the shares and is a direct or indirect subsidiary of Porch or is otherwise controlled, directly or indirectly, by Porch. For accounting purposes, the shares contributed to HOA are considered treasury stock as of September 30, 2024, because HOA is a subsidiary that is included in our consolidated financial results. \n\nWarrants\n\nThere was no activity related to private warrants during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there were 1.8 million private warrants outstanding for common shares. These private warrants are liability classified financial instruments measured at fair value, with periodic changes in fair value recognized through earnings and are included in “change in fair value of private warrant liability” in the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).

The PRSUs will vest, if at all, upon our achieving a specified target for each vesting condition. The weighted average grant-date fair value of PRSUs granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $5.61. TSR will be measured against the total shareholder return of the S&P SmallCap 600 Index during the performance period. The actual number of shares of common stock to be issued to each award recipient at the end of the performance period will be interpolated between a threshold and maximum payout amount based on actual performance results. A participant will earn 50% of the target number of PRSUs for “Threshold Performance,” 100% of the target number of PRSUs for “Target Performance,” and 200% of the target number of PRSUs for “Maximum Performance.” We estimate the grant-date fair value of TSR PRSUs using the Monte Carlo simulation model, as the TSR metric is considered a market condition under ASC Topic 718, Compensation - stock compensation.  \n  \n[X](javascript:void\\(0\\);)  \n---  \n[- Definition](javascript:void\\(0\\);)The entire disclosure for share-based payment arrangement.

Reinsurance2023 ProgramOur third-party quota share reinsurance program was split into three separate placements to maximize coverage and cost efficiency. The Coastal Program was effective for the period April 1, 2023, through March 31, 2024, and covered our business in certain Texas coastal regions and the Houston metropolitan area and was placed at 42% of subject property and casualty losses (“P&C losses”), as well as all business in South Carolina which was placed at 7% of P&C losses. The Core Program, which covered the portion of our business not in the Coastal Program, was effective for the period April 1, 2023, through March 31, 2024, and was placed at 9.5% of P&C losses of our remaining business in Texas and 8% of P&C losses of our business in other states. In addition, the Combined Program was effective for the period January 1, 2023, through March 31, 2024, and covered all of our business and was placed at 5% of P&C losses. All programs were subject to certain limits and exclusions, which vary by participating reinsurer. Property catastrophe excess of loss treaties were placed on April 1, 2023, and were updated in August 2023 after the events described in the “Terminated Reinsurance Contract” section below. Coverage for wind storms starts at $20 million per occurrence. Losses are shared between $20 million and $80 million. Over $80 million, losses are covered up to a net loss of $440 million. We also place reinstatement premium protection to cover any reinstatement premiums due on the first four layers. 2024 ProgramAs of April 1, 2024, our quota share program consists of one combined program covering all of our business in all states and is placed at 27.5% of P&C losses. All programs are effective for the period April 1, 2024, through March 31, 2025, and are subject to certain limits and exclusions, which vary by participating reinsurer.Coverage for catastrophe events starts immediately within the quota share contracts and at $45.0 million per occurrence within the property catastrophe excess of loss treaties placed on April 1, 2024. Losses are shared at various levels up to $75.0 million. Over $75.0 million losses are covered up to a loss of $465.0 million. We also place reinstatement premium protection to cover any reinstatement premiums due on the first five layers.We placed a parametric reinsurance contract to cover aggregate severe convective storm losses from January 1, 2024, to January 1, 2025. This contract would provide up to $30.0 million in recovery over $85.0 million in modeled losses. Reinsurance ImpactThe effects of reinsurance on premiums written and earned for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were as follows:| Three Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024| 2023  \nWritten| Earned| Written| Earned  \nDirect premiums| $| 130,780| $| 103,328| $| 130,952| $| 117,032  \nCeded premiums| (48,408)| (40,855)| 30,358 | (41,846)  \nNet premiums| $| 82,372| $| 62,473| $| 161,310| $| 75,186  \n  \nNine Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024| 2023  \nWritten| Earned| Written| Earned  \nDirect premiums| $| 315,600 | $| 314,262 | $| 349,365 | $| 348,253   \nCeded premiums| (138,594)| (117,736)| (34,763)| (188,686)  \nNet premiums| $| 177,006 | $| 196,526 | $| 314,602 | $| 159,567   \n  \nThe effects of reinsurance on incurred losses and loss adjustment expense (“LAE”) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were as follows:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nDirect losses and LAE| $| 53,821 | $| 44,273 | $| 243,447 | $| 271,879   \nCeded losses and LAE| (14,803)| (1,727)| (51,346)| (115,325)  \nNet losses and LAE| $| 39,018 | $| 42,546 | $| 192,101 | $| 156,554   \n  \nThe detail of reinsurance balances due is as follows:\n\nSeptember 30,2024| December 31,2023  \n---|---  \nCeded unearned premium| $| 65,603 | $| 50,697   \nLosses and LAE reserve| 19,682 | 19,911   \nReinsurance recoverable| 18,144 | 12,629   \nOther| — | 345   \nReinsurance balance due| $| 103,429 | $| 83,582   \n  \nTerminated Reinsurance Contract\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, HOA discovered that Vesttoo Ltd (“Vesttoo”), which arranged capital for one of our reinsurance contracts, faced allegations of fraudulent activity in connection with collateral it provided to HOA and certain other third parties, which allegations have since been confirmed. We communicated and met with regulators and other key stakeholders regarding the fraud committed and the terminated reinsurance contract. This reinsurance agreement provided partial quota share coverage as well as up to approximately $175 million in a catastrophic event.\n\nAs a result of its findings, and in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance agreement, HOA terminated the associated contract on August 4, 2023, with an effective date of July 1, 2023. Had the contract not been terminated, the contract would have expired on December 31, 2023, and HOA would have been contracted to pay approximately $20 million in additional premium payments during July through December 2023. Following the effective date of the termination, HOA seized available liquid collateral in the amount of approximately $47.6 million from a reinsurance trust, of which HOA was the beneficiary and recognized a charge of $48.2 million in provision for (recovery of) doubtful accounts in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, HOA is evaluating and intends to pursue all available legal claims and remedies to enforce its rights under the letter of credit required by the reinsurance agreement in the amount of $300 million as additional collateral. We have been appointed to the statutory committee of unsecured creditors in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of Vesttoo and are pursuing recovery of all losses and damages incurred as a result of terminating the reinsurance agreement due to fraud committed by third parties. \n\nOn January 19, 2024, we entered into a five-year business collaboration agreement with Aon Corp. and Aon Re, Inc. (\"Aon\"), resulting in payments to us of approximately $25 million in January 2024 and additional cash payments through the end of the contract term. Of the cash payments that we have or will receive through the end of the contract term, $8.7 million is non-refundable and immediately recognized in other income, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss). A portion of the remaining amount is potentially refundable to Aon if we breach the agreement, including if we directly or indirectly place reinsurance with brokers unaffiliated with Aon, subject to customary cure rights. The remaining amount will be recognized in other income, net, over the term of the agreement. As part of this agreement, Aon and Porch also signed a mutual release of claims arising from the Vesttoo fraud. Porch has not released any claims against non-Aon parties related to these matters and intends to vigorously pursue recovery. In addition to this arrangement, we have also received cash recoveries from other parties in the amount of $3.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.  \n  \n[X](javascript:void\\(0\\);)  \n---  \n[- References](javascript:void\\(0\\);)No definition available.

Commitments and ContingenciesFrom time to time we are or may become subject to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings initiated by users, other entities, or regulatory bodies. Estimated liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In many instances, we are unable to determine whether a loss is probable or to reasonably estimate the amount of such a loss and, therefore, the potential future losses arising from a matter may differ from the amount of estimated liabilities we have recorded in the financial statements covering these matters. We review our estimates periodically and make adjustments to reflect negotiations, estimated settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter.Cases under Telephone Consumer Protection ActPorch and/or an acquired entity, GoSmith.com, are party to a legal proceeding alleging violations of the automated calling and/or internal and National Do Not Call restrictions of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 and a related Washington state law claim. The proceedings were commenced as thirteen separate mass tort actions brought by a single plaintiffs’ law firm in December 2019 and April/May 2020 in federal district courts throughout the United States. One of the actions was dismissed with prejudice and appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. While the appeal was pending, the remaining cases were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, where Porch resides. On October 12, 2022, in a split decision, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. Following remand, that case was also consolidated with the Western District of Washington action. Plaintiffs then filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, which was granted in part and denied in part. The Second Amended Complaint was filed in July 2023. In September 2023, Defendants filed a Motion to Strike the Second Amended Complaint; this motion was denied. Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss was filed on February 15, 2024 and is fully briefed and awaiting a decision. The parties have each filed several notices of supplemental authority in support of their respective positions on the pending Motion to Dismiss. The parties’ also filed a required Joint Status Report and Discovery Plan on February 16, 2024. Discovery is stayed until Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is decided. Plaintiffs seek actual, statutory, and/or treble damages, injunctive relief, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. The action is at an early stage in the litigation process. It is not possible to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of these disputes, although it is reasonably possible that the outcome of these actions may be unfavorable. Further, it is not possible to estimate the range or amount of potential loss (if the outcome should be unfavorable). We intend to contest this case vigorously.OtherIn addition, in the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are (or may become) parties to litigation involving property, personal injury, contract, intellectual property and other claims, as well as stockholder derivative actions, class action lawsuits and other matters. The amounts that may be recovered in such matters may be subject to insurance coverage. Although the results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are currently a party to any legal proceedings the outcome of which, we believe, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  \n  \n[X](javascript:void\\(0\\);)  \n---  \n[- References](javascript:void\\(0\\);)No definition available.

Segment InformationWe have two reportable segments that are also operating segments: Vertical Software and Insurance. Reportable segments were identified based on how the chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”) manages the business, makes operating decisions, and evaluates operating and financial performance. Our chief executive officer acts as the CODM and reviews financial and operational information for our reportable segments. Operating segments are components of an enterprise for which separate discrete financial information is available and operational results are regularly evaluated by the CODM for the purposes of making decisions regarding resource allocation and assessing performance. Our Vertical Software segment provides software and services to inspection, mortgage, and title companies on a subscription and transactional basis, while also providing move and post-move services. Software and services were 59% and 59% of total vertical software revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Move and post-move services were 41% and 41% of total vertical software revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Vertical Software segment operates as several key businesses, including inspection software and services, title insurance software, mortgage software, moving services, mover and homeowner marketing, and measurement software for roofers.Our Insurance segment provides consumers with insurance and warranty products to protect their homes, earning revenue through premiums collected on policies, policy fees and commissions. The Insurance segment includes HOA, a wholly owned insurance carrier, other insurance-related legal entities, Porch Warranty, and other warranty brands. The following table summarizes revenue by segment.| Three Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nVertical Software| $| 31,252 | $| 34,328 | $| 91,340 | $| 97,390   \nInsurance| 79,948 | 95,228 | 246,147 | 218,300   \nTotal revenue| $| 111,200 | $| 129,556 | $| 337,487 | $| 315,690   \n  \nOur segment operating and financial performance measure is Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss). Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) is defined as revenue less the following expenses associated with each segment: cost of revenue, selling and marketing, product and technology, and general and administrative. Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) also excludes non-cash items or items that management does not consider reflective of ongoing core operations. \n\nWe do not allocate shared expenses to the reportable segments. These expenses are included in the “Corporate and other” row in the following reconciliation. “Corporate and other” includes shared expenses such as selling and marketing; certain product and technology; accounting; human resources; legal; general and administrative; and other income, expenses, gains, and losses that are not allocated in assessing segment performance due to their function. Such transactions are excluded from the reportable segments’ results but are included in consolidated results.\n\nThe reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) to consolidated “Operating income (loss)” below includes the effects of corporate and other items that the CODM does not consider in assessing segment performance. \n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA (Loss):  \nVertical Software| $| 5,138 | $| 3,179 | $| 11,039 | $| 4,599   \nInsurance| 24,829 | 19,038 | (5,376)| (19,328)  \nSubtotal| 29,967 | 22,217 | 5,663 | (14,729)  \nReconciling items:  \nCorporate and other| (13,032)| (13,378)| (40,289)| (41,448)  \nDepreciation and amortization| (6,049)| (6,272)| (18,568)| (18,501)  \nStock-based compensation expense| (6,735)| (6,979)| (19,208)| (20,277)  \nRestructuring costs (1)| (1,668)| (712)| (3,460)| (2,789)  \nOther non-operating income| (1,241)| — | (4,113)| —   \nAcquisition and other transaction costs| (102)| (22)| (268)| (408)  \nImpairment loss on intangible assets and goodwill| — | — | — | (57,232)  \nRecovery of (loss on) reinsurance contract (see Note 10)| 285 | 7,043 | 1,391 | (41,201)  \nImpairment loss on property, equipment and software| — | — | — | (254)  \nChange in fair value of contingent consideration| (142)| 787 | 158 | 3,597   \nInvestment income and realized gains| (3,787)| (2,485)| (10,957)| (4,492)  \nOperating income (loss)| $| (2,504)| $| 199 | $| (89,651)| $| (197,734)  \n  \n______________________________________\n\n(1)Primarily consists of costs related to forming a reciprocal exchange.\n\nThe CODM does not review assets on a segment basis.\n\nAll of our revenue is generated in the United States except for an immaterial amount.

\n[**Earnings Per Share [Abstract]**](javascript:void\\(0\\);)  \n[Net Income (Loss) Per Share](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | Note 17. Net Income (Loss) Per ShareEarnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated using the two-class method unless the treasury stock method results in lower EPS. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income or loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. To calculate diluted EPS, basic EPS is further adjusted to include the effect of potentially dilutive stock options, RSUs, PRSUs, RSAs, convertible notes, earnout shares, and warrants using the more dilutive result of the treasury stock method or the if-converted method. All potentially dilutive securities are antidilutive to periods with net losses, and basic EPS equals diluted EPS in those periods.The following table summarizes the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) attributable per share to common stockholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: | Three Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nNumerator:  \nNet income (loss) used to compute net income (loss) per share - basic| $| 14,382 | $| (5,744)| $| (63,303)| $| (131,447)  \nEffect of dilutive securities: 2026 Notes| 694 | — | — | —   \nNet income (loss) used to compute net income (loss) per share - diluted| $| 15,076 | $| (5,744)| $| (63,303)| $| (131,447)  \nDenominator:  \nWeighted average shares outstanding used to compute net income (loss) per share - basic| 100,430| 96,367| 99,050| 95,771  \nEffect of dilutive securities:  \nRSUs| 8,779 | — | — | —   \nPRSUs| 6,301 | — | — | —   \n2026 Notes| 8,523 | — | — | —   \nWeighted average shares outstanding used to compute net income (loss) per share - diluted| 124,033 | 96,367 | 99,050 | 95,771   \nNet income (loss) per share - basic| $| 0.14 | $| (0.06)| $| (0.64)| $| (1.37)  \nNet income (loss) per share - diluted| $| 0.12 | $| (0.06)| $| (0.64)| $| (1.37)  \n  \nThe following table discloses securities that were not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share because to do so would have been antidilutive for the periods presented:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nStock options| 3,231| 3,686| 3,231| 3,686  \nRestricted stock units and awards| —| 8,655| 8,565| 8,655  \nPerformance restricted stock units| —| 4,056| 6,300| 4,056  \nPublic and private warrants| 1,796| 1,796| 1,796| 1,796  \nEarnout shares (1)| —| 2,050| —| 2,050  \nConvertible debt (2)| 13,332| 22,331| 20,282| 22,331  \nContingently issuable shares in connection with acquisitions (3)| —| 24,363| —| 24,363  \n  \n______________________________________\n\n(1)Earnout shares expired December 23, 2023, without vesting and were subsequently cancelled.\n\n(2)In connection with the September 16, 2021, issuance of the 2026 Notes, we used a portion of the proceeds to pay for the capped call transactions, which are expected to generally reduce the potential dilution to our common stock. The capped call transactions impact the number of shares that may be issued by effectively increasing our conversion price from $25 per share to approximately $37.74, which would result in approximately 5 million potentially dilutive shares instead of the shares reported in this table as of September 30, 2024.\n\n(3)In connection with the acquisition of Floify, we issued shares as partial closing consideration and guaranteed that the value of those shares would equal or exceed 200% of such price on or prior to December 31, 2024. If the value of those shares did not equal or exceed 200% of their value, we would have been obligated to settle any differences in cash, Porch common stock, or combination thereof. On March 27, 2024, we entered into a settlement agreement to settle a post-closing dispute. As part of this agreement, the sellers of Floify agreed to terminate this obligation in full.  \n  \n[X](javascript:void\\(0\\);)  \n---  \n[- References](javascript:void\\(0\\);)No definition available.

Accounting Policies (Policies)** | 9 Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSep. 30, 2024  \n[**Accounting Policies [Abstract]**](javascript:void\\(0\\);)  \n[Unaudited Interim Financial Statements](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | Unaudited Interim Financial StatementsThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Porch Group, Inc., and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024. The information as of December 31, 2023, included in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Quarterly Report”) were prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments (all of which are of a normal recurring nature) considered necessary to present fairly our financial position, results of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for the periods and dates presented. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024, or any other interim period or future year due to various factors such as management estimates and the seasonal nature of some portions of our insurance business.  \n[Use of Estimates](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported of certain assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions.  \n[Concentrations](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | ConcentrationsFinancial instruments which potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of cash, money market accounts on deposit with financial institutions, money market funds, certificates of deposit and fixed-maturity securities, as well as receivable balances in the course of collection.Our insurance carrier subsidiary has exposure and remains liable in the event of insolvency of its reinsurers. Management and its reinsurance intermediary regularly assess the credit quality and ratings of its reinsurer counterparties. As of September 30, 2024, three reinsurers represented more than 10% individually, and 68% in the aggregate, of total reinsurance balance due on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.Substantially all revenues in the Insurance segment are derived from customers in Texas (which represent approximately 71% of Insurance segment revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024), South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Arizona, and Illinois, which could be adversely affected by economic conditions, an increase in competition, local weather events, or environmental impacts and changes.  \n[Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash and Cash EquivalentsWe consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. We maintain cash balances that may exceed the insured limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.   \n[Accounts Receivable and Long-term Insurance Commissions Receivable](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | Accounts Receivable and Long-term Insurance Commissions ReceivableAccounts receivable consist principally of amounts due from enterprise customers, other corporate partnerships, and individual policyholders. We estimate allowances for uncollectible receivables based on the creditworthiness of our customers, historical trend analysis, and macro-economic conditions. Consequently, an adverse change in those factors could affect our estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for uncollectible receivables at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, was $0.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively.Long-term insurance commissions receivable consists of the estimated commissions from policy renewals expected to be collected. We record the amount of renewal insurance commissions expected to be collected in the next twelve months as current accounts receivable.  \n[Goodwill](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | GoodwillWe test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit on an annual basis or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. We have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if an impairment is more likely than not to have occurred. If we can support the conclusion that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we would not need to perform a quantitative impairment test. If we cannot support such a conclusion or we do not elect to perform the qualitative assessment, then we perform a quantitative assessment. If a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment is performed, we utilize a combination of market and income valuation approaches. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. We have selected October 1 as the date to perform annual impairment testing.Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes on each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using a combination of income and market valuation approaches using publicly traded company multiples in similar businesses. Such fair value measurements are based predominately on Level 3 inputs. This analysis requires significant judgments including an estimate of future cash flows which is dependent on internally developed forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital, which is risk-adjusted to reflect the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested.  \n[Impairment of Long-Lived Assets](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsWe review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Events that trigger a test for recoverability include a significant decrease in the market price for a long-lived asset, significant negative industry or economic trends, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition, a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset, or a sustained decrease in share price. When a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed, comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group. If the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, the asset group’s fair value is measured relying primarily on an income approach. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. Management identifies the asset group that includes the potentially impaired long-lived asset, at the lowest level at which there are separate, identifiable cash flows.We estimate the fair value of an asset group using the income approach. Such fair value measurements are based predominately on Level 3 inputs. Inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business plan forecasts, expected growth rates, and cost of capital, similar to those a market participant would use to assess fair value. We also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions and other data. Many of these factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods.  \n[Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | Deferred Policy Acquisition CostsWe capitalize deferred policy acquisitions costs (“DAC”) which consist primarily of commissions, premium taxes and policy underwriting and production expenses that are directly related to the successful acquisition by our insurance company subsidiary of new or renewal insurance contracts. DAC are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the policies to which they relate, which is generally one year. DAC is also reduced by ceding commissions paid by reinsurance companies which represent recoveries of acquisition costs. DAC is periodically reviewed for recoverability and adjusted if necessary. Future investment income is considered in determining the recoverability of DAC.   \n[Expected Credit Losses](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | Expected Credit LossesWe regularly review our individual investment securities for factors that may indicate that a decline in fair value of an investment has resulted from an expected credit loss, including:•the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events that may affect its operations or earnings;•the extent to which the market value of the security is below its cost or amortized cost;•general market conditions and industry or sector specific factors;•nonpayment by the issuer of its contractually obligated interest and principal payments; and•our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of costs.  \n[Fair Value of Financial Instruments](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsFair value principles require disclosures regarding the manner in which fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a three-tiered fair value hierarchy into which these assets and liabilities must be grouped, based upon significant levels of inputs as follows:Level 1 Observable inputs, such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;Level 2 Observable inputs, other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; andLevel 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.The lowest level of significant input determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy. Management’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires management to make judgments and consider factors specific to the asset or liability.  \n[Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted](javascript:void\\(0\\);) | Accounting Standards Not Yet AdoptedIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting--Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires incremental disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments but does not change the definition of a segment or the guidance for determining reportable segments. The new guidance requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are (1) regularly provided to (or easily computed from information regularly provided to) the chief operating decision maker and (2) included in the reported measure of segment profit or loss. The new standard also allows companies to disclose multiple measures of segment profit or loss if those measures are used to assess performance and allocate resources. The guidance will first be effective in our annual disclosures for the year ending December 31, 2024, and will be adopted retrospectively unless impracticable. Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of assessing the impact of ASU 2023-07 on our disclosures.In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires disaggregated information about our effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The new guidance will first be effective in our annual disclosures for the year ending December 31, 2025, and should be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of assessing the impact of ASU 2023-09 on our disclosures.In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures, which requires that public entities disclose, on an annual and interim basis, disaggregated information about specific expense categories (including employee compensation, depreciation, and amortization) presented on the face of the income statement. The guidance will first be effective in our annual disclosures for the year ending December 31, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of assessing the impact of ASU 2024-03 on our disclosures.  \n  \n[X](javascript:void\\(0\\);)  \n---  \n[- Definition](javascript:void\\(0\\);)Disclosure of accounting policy for unaudited interim financial statements.
