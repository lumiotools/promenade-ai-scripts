Enters into Definitive Merger Agreement to Acquire Kineta, Inc.\n\nDec 12, 2024\n\n_**Opportunistic acquisition adds Phase 2 novel checkpoint inhibitor (KVA12123) to TuHURA’s late stage pipeline**_\n\n_**Targeting Phase 2a/b trial with KVA12123 in mutated NPM1 AML in 2025**_\n\n_**Cross product and technology synergies build on TuHURA’s therapeutic focus on overcoming primary and acquired resistance to cancer immunotherapy**_\n\n_**Proposed Transaction expected to close in Q1 2025**_\n\n**TAMPA, FL AND SEATTLE, WA / December 12, 2024 /** TuHURA Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:HURA) (“TuHURA”), a Phase 3 registration-stage immune-oncology company developing novel technologies to overcome resistance to cancer immunotherapy, and Kineta, Inc. (OTC PINK:KANT) (“Kineta”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of novel immunotherapies in oncology that address cancer immune resistance, today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement in which TuHURA would acquire Kineta, including the rights to Kineta’s novel KVA12123 antibody, for a combination of cash and shares of TuHURA common stock via a merger transaction (the “Proposed Transaction”).\n\n![](https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/e03db074-3c89-4f7d-ba4d-93184fee7f44/953841/screenshot-2024-12-11-203059.png)\n\n“We are pleased to have entered into this definitive agreement with Kineta, which represents the culmination of the Exclusivity and Right of First Offer Agreement that TuHURA and Kineta entered into in July 2024. Our strategy of providing Kineta this past summer with a $5 million exclusivity fee to restart and finish their Phase 1 monotherapy and combination with pembrolizumab trial demonstrated our view that the PK/PD profile would position KVA12123 as a potential best-in-class V-domain Ig suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA)-inhibiting antibody. We believe the real potential for this class of checkpoint inhibitors resides in the treatment of blood related cancers. The data presented at the December 2024 ASH meeting indicates a strong correlation between NPM1 mutations (mNPM1) and elevated VISTA expression, particularly in the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where high VISTA levels on leukemia cells, associated with mNPM1, can potentially contribute to immune evasion and disease progression impacting their treatment response. Given mNPM1 drives leukemogenesis through menin, and the introduction of menin inhibitors improving treatment responses in mNPM1-associated AML, a combination with a VISTA-inhibiting antibody could be the next step in improving response rates in AML,” commented James Bianco, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of TuHURA.\n\nKVA12123 is a VISTA-blocking immunotherapy in development as a monoclonal antibody infusion drug dosed every two-week cycles. It is completing two clinical trials both as a monotherapy and in combination with Merck’s anti-PD1 therapy, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), in patients with advanced treatment-refractory solid tumors. Competitive therapies targeting VISTA have demonstrated either poor monotherapy anti-tumor activity in preclinical models or induction of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in human clinical trials. Through the combination of unique epitope binding and an optimized IgG1 Fc region, KVA12123 demonstrates strong monotherapy tumor growth inhibition in preclinical models without evidence of CRS in clinical trial participants. KVA12123 has been shown to de-risk the VISTA target and provides a novel approach to address immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) with a mechanism of action that is differentiated and complementary with T cell focused therapies. KVA12123 may be an effective immunotherapy for many types of cancer and represents the introduction of a new class of checkpoint inhibitors.\n\nVISTA is a negative immune checkpoint that suppresses T cell function in a variety of solid tumors. High VISTA expression in tumor correlates with poor survival in cancer patients and has been associated with a lack of response to other immune checkpoint inhibitors. Blocking VISTA induces an efficient polyfunctional immune response to address immunosuppression and drives anti-tumor responses.\n\nKVA12123 has completed enrollment in its monotherapy arm, demonstrating safety at its highest dose level (1000mg). Kineta anticipates completion of enrollment in the combination therapy arm where KVA12123 is administered with Merck’s anti-PD1 therapy, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab). Initial results were reported earlier this year at the [American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024](https://pr.report/4ysr) and at the [Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) meeting](https://pr.report/4yss), supporting best-in-class profile.\n\n“Following a thorough review of exploring strategic alternatives for Kineta and the discussions held with TuHURA over the course of the past several months, we believe this acquisition by TuHURA maximizes shareholder value and provides an exciting development path forward for KVA12123. We believe KVA12123 has multiple synergies with both of TuHURA’s IFx and Delta receptor antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) and peptide drug conjugate (PDC) technologies and that a TuHURA acquisition will provide the necessary resources to advance KVA12123 through its clinical development, maximizing value for Kineta’s shareholders,” said Craig W. Philips, President of Kineta. “In addition to the TuHURA transaction, Kineta is continuing to pursue partnership opportunities for some of its other non-KVA12123-related products and technologies prior to the close of the TuHURA transaction.”\n\n**About the Proposed Transaction**\n\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, upon the completion of the Proposed Transaction, Kineta stockholders will receive their pro rata share (based on the number of Kineta fully diluted shares held by them) of aggregate merger consideration consisting of a combination of cash and shares of TuHURA common stock. The cash component of the aggregate merger consideration will be a base cash amount of $9,005,000 (consisting of a value of $15,000,000 minus the $5,995,000 advanced to Kineta under the Exclusivity and Right of First Offer Agreement) less the sum of Kineta’s working capital deficit at the closing of the Proposed Transaction and any working capital loans made by TuHURA to Kineta between the signing of the merger agreement and closing of the Proposed Transaction. The share component of the aggregate merger consideration will consist of an aggregate of up to approximately 3,476,568 shares of TuHURA common stock, subject to a six-month holdback of approximately 869,142 of such shares to satisfy certain additional liabilities of the closing date that may be identified after the closing. As additional merger consideration, Kineta stockholders will be entitled to receive their pro rata share of certain payments that Kineta may receive after the closing from the potential pre-closing sale by Kineta of certain non-KVA12123 products and technologies.\n\nIn connection with the merger agreement, TuHURA and Kineta entered into a Clinical Trial Funding Agreement under which TuHURA agreed to continue to fund clinical trial expenses for KVA12123 in an amount of up to $900,000, which may be increased upon mutual agreement. The merger agreement also provides that Kineta may request the extension of up to $2,000,000 in working capital loans from TuHURA, $1,750,000 of which will be contingent on the completion of a financing transaction by TuHURA.\n\nThe merger agreement has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is subject to Kineta stockholder approval. The completion of the Proposed Transaction is also subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain other conditions, such as the approval by TuHURA’s stockholders of an increase in the number of authorized shares of TuHURA common stock, Kineta’s working capital deficit not exceeding $12,000,000 at the time of closing, the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 registering the shares of TuHURA common stock issuable to the Kineta stockholders in the Proposed Transaction, and other customary closing conditions. The Proposed Transaction is currently expected to close in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n**About TuHURA Biosciences, Inc.**\n\nTuHURA Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: HURA) is a Phase 3 registration-stage immuno-oncology company developing novel technologies to overcome primary and acquired resistance to cancer immunotherapy, two of the most common reasons cancer immunotherapies fail to work or stop working in the majority of patients with cancer.\n\nTuHURA’s lead innate immune agonist candidate, IFx-2.0, is designed to overcome primary resistance to checkpoint inhibitors. TuHURA is preparing to initiate a single randomized placebo-controlled Phase 3 registration trial of IFx-2.0 administered as an adjunctive therapy to Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) in first line treatment for advanced or metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma.\n\nIn addition to its innate immune agonist candidates, TuHURA is leveraging its Delta receptor technology to develop first-in-class bi-specific ADCs and PDCs targeting Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells to inhibit their immune-suppressing effects on the TME to prevent T cell exhaustion and acquired resistance to checkpoint inhibitors and cellular therapies.\n\nFor more information, please visit [tuhurabio.com](https://pr.report/4yst) and connect with TuHURA on [Facebook](https://pr.report/4ysu), [X](https://pr.report/4ysv), and [LinkedIn](https://pr.report/4ysw).\n\n**About Kineta**\n\nKineta, Inc. (OTC Pink: KANT) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a mission to develop next-generation immunotherapies that transform patients’ lives. Kineta has leveraged its expertise in innate immunity and is focused on discovering and developing potentially differentiated immunotherapies that address the major challenges with current cancer therapy. Kineta’s immuno-oncology pipeline includes KVA12123, a novel VISTA blocking immunotherapy currently in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors, and a preclinical monoclonal antibody targeting CD27.

KVA12123 provides a novel approach to address immune suppression in the TME with a mechanism of action that is differentiated and complementary with T cell focused therapies. KVA12123 may be an effective immunotherapy for many types of cancer including non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), colorectal, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck, and ovarian cancer.\n\nIn February 2024, Kineta announced a significant corporate restructuring to substantially reduce expenses and preserve cash. The restructuring included a significant workforce reduction and the suspension of enrollment of new patients in its ongoing VISTA-101 Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating KVA12123 in patients with advanced solid tumors. At that time, Kineta also announced that it was exploring strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value.\n\n**Additional Information About the Proposed Transaction for Investors and Shareholders**\n\nIn connection with the Proposed Transaction between TuHURA and Kineta TuHURA and Kineta intend to file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) a Registration Statement on Form S-4 that will contain a preliminary prospectus of TuHURA and a proxy statement of Kineta in connection with the Proposed Transaction, referred to as a proxy statement/prospectus.

(Nasdaq: HURA) Outlines Development Pathway for Single Phase 3 Accelerated Approval Registration Trial in First Line Treatment of Advanced or Metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma and Provides Business Update\n\nNov 25, 2024\n\n_**IFx-2.0, a first-in-class innate immune response agonist, entering single Phase 3 accelerated approval registration trial in first half of 2025 for first line treatment of Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) under Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) agreement with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**_\n\n_**Entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Kineta regarding a potential transaction in which TuHURA would acquire the rights to KVA12123 expanding its pipeline with a Phase 2 ready, novel VISTA inhibiting antibody**_\n\n_**Advancing IFx-3.0, the first systemically administered tumor-targeted mRNA innate immune response agonist for aggressive B Cell Lymphoma**_\n\n_**Early discovery programs designing first-in-class tumor microenvironment modulating bi-specific antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) or peptide drug conjugates (PDCs) targeting Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs)**_\n\n_**Company expands leadership team with key clinical and regulatory appointments to drive strategy and operational execution**_\n\n**TAMPA, FL / November 25, 2024 /** TuHURA Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq:HURA) (“TuHURA” or the “Company”), a Phase 3 registration-stage immune-oncology company developing novel technologies to overcome resistance to cancer immunotherapy, today provided a business update and outlined upcoming targeted milestones.\n\n![](https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/a70ba5bb-9934-4d62-899c-9edd28d808a1/946558/image.png)\n\n“We have made significant progress toward accomplishing our 2024 corporate objectives, including reaching a Special Protocol Assessment agreement with the FDA by working with the Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE) and FDA’s Project Front Runner initiative for a novel Phase 3 trial design for IFx-2.0 under the FDA’s accelerated approval pathway. This single registration directed trial, in addition to its primary endpoint of Overall Response Rate (ORR), it will also incorporate a key secondary endpoint of Progression Free Survival (PFS) that, if achieved, can satisfy the requirement for a post-approval confirmatory trial, potentially converting accelerated approval to full approval,” commented James Bianco, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of TuHURA. “We have also advanced our efforts toward the potential acquisition of KVA12123, a novel VISTA inhibiting antibody, with a non-binding letter of intent, which would bring to our pipeline a Phase 2 ready candidate with therapeutic synergies across our pipeline and technologies, all while becoming a NASDAQ-listed Company after having raised significant capital adequate to advance our current programs late into the second half of 2025.”\n\n**_Advancing Novel Technologies to Overcome Resistance to Cancer Immunotherapy_**\n\n**Innate Immune Response Agonists** : TuHURA’s IFx technology utilizes a proprietary plasmid DNA or messenger RNA (“mRNA”) which, when introduced into or targeted to a tumor, results in the expression of a highly immunogenic gram-positive, bacterial protein (Emm55) on the surface of the tumor cell, making the tumor look like a bacterium. Gram-positive bacterium has molecular patterns, or motifs, preserved over evolution which are recognized by receptors on our immune cells called toll like receptors (TLR). TLR 2 specifically recognizes the pattern of gram-positive bacterial proteins, like Emm55 leading to the activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs). Once activated, APCs digest the tumor cell and present non-self, tumor neoantigens to newly produced T and B cells, activating a tumor-specific adaptive immune response. Through its activation of tumor specific T cells, IFx-2.0 administration can potentially overcome primary resistance to checkpoint inhibitors.\n\nTuHURA is preparing to initiate a single, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 accelerated approval trial of IFx-2.0 administered as an adjunctive therapy to Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) versus pembrolizumab plus placebo in first line treatment for checkpoint inhibitor-naïve patients with advanced or metastatic MCC. The data from the Company’s Phase 1b trial in patients with advanced or metastatic MCC who exhibited primary resistance to CPI was used to support a potential single registration directed trial. Consistent with the FDA’s Project Front Runner Initiative, the FDA’s OCE recommended investigating IFx-2.0 in the first line setting rather than in patients progressing on first line therapy.\n\nProject Front Runner is an FDA OCE initiative to encourage drug sponsors to consider when it may be appropriate to first develop and seek approval of new cancer drugs for advanced or metastatic disease, in an earlier clinical setting rather than the usual approach to develop and seek approval of a new drug for treatment of patients who have received numerous prior lines of therapies or have exhausted available treatment options.\n\nThe FDA also encouraged the Company to consider designing the trial to include a key secondary endpoint shown to be of clinical benefit like PFS allowing this accelerated approval trial to potentially satisfy both the requirements for accelerated approval based on ORR, while satisfying the requirement for a post-approval confirmatory trial if the secondary PFS endpoint is achieved. The trial will be conducted under an SPA agreement with the FDA.\n\n**Tumor Microenvironment Modulators:** Leveraging its Delta receptor technology, TuHURA is developing bi-specific immune modulating ADCs or PDCs targeting MDSCs to inhibit their immune suppressing effects on the tumor microenvironment to prevent T cell exhaustion and acquired resistance to checkpoint inhibitors and cellular therapies.\n\n**Potential Acquisition of Novel Anti-VISTA Checkpoint Inhibitor:** As previously announced on July 8, 2024, TuHURA entered into an Exclusivity and Right of First Offer Agreement with Kineta, Inc. (OTC Pink: KANT) for the potential acquisition of Kineta’s KVA12123 VISTA inhibiting antibody. TuHURA has continued to engage in discussions and negotiations with Kineta and has entered into a non-binding letter of intent regarding a potential transaction in which TuHURA would acquire the rights to KVA12123 for a combination of cash and shares of TuHURA common stock via a merger transaction structure.\n\nKVA12123 has completed enrollment in its monotherapy arm, demonstrating safety at its highest dose level (1000mg). Kineta anticipates completion of enrollment in the combination therapy arm where KVA12123 is administered with Merck’s anti-PD1 therapy, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab). Initial results were reported earlier this year at the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024 and recently at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) meeting.\n\n**_Upcoming Milestone Targets_**\n\nTuHURA is targeting the achievement of the following potential milestones for the remainder of 2024 and 2025:\n\n  * Q4 2024: Reach a potential definitive agreement for acquisition of KVA12123 VISTA inhibiting antibody via merger with Kineta, subject to continuing diligence and negotiations with Kineta\n\n  * H1 2025: Initiate IFx-2.0 Phase 3 trial\n\n  * H1 2025: IFx-2.0 Inhibitor Resistant “basket” trial\n\n  * H1 2025: Complete potential acquisition of transaction involving Kineta’s KVA12123\n\n  * H2 2025: Commence VISTA inhibiting Mab Phase 2 trials (if Kineta merger transaction has been completed)\n\n  * H2 2025: Bi-specific MDSC targeted ADC _in vivo_ POC\n\n  * H2 2025: IFx-3.0: CD22+ tumor targeted mRNA _in vivo_ POC studies\n\n\n\n\n__REM-001__\n\nThe legacy asset from the completed merger with Kintara Therapeutics, Inc., REM-001, is a late-stage photodynamic therapy (“PDT”) currently being evaluated in an open-label 15- patient study for the treatment of cutaneous metastatic breast cancer. As of October 7, 2024, four patients had been dosed. The Company currently expects to complete enrollment in Q4 2024. Based on the Company’s strategic focus on advancing its technologies that seek to overcome the major obstacles that limit the effectiveness of current immunotherapies in treating cancer, TuHURA plans to seek licensing opportunities for REM-001.\n\nIn connection with the completed merger with Kintara, existing stockholders of Kintara received contingent value rights entitling them to receive additional shares of TuHURA common stock upon achievement of enrollment of a minimum of 10 patients in the REM-001 Study, with such patients each completing 8 weeks of follow-up on or before December 31, 2025.\n\n**_Key Management Hires to Advance Development_**\n\nThe Company also announced the key management appointments of Peter O’Neill as Vice President, Clinical Operations and Michael Krsulich as Head of Quality Assurance.\n\n__Peter O’Neill__\n\nMr. O’Neill brings over 25 years of clinical trial experience, having led large and small Clinical Operations teams at sponsors (Biotech/Pharma), CROs and research hospitals.

(\"Kintara”) consummated a previously announced merger transaction in accordance with the terms of\nthat certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 2, 2024 (the \"Merger Agreement”), by and among Kintara, Kayak Mergeco, Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct\nwholly owned subsidiary of Kintara (\"Merger Sub”), and TuHURA Biosciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\"TuHURA”), pursuant to which, Merger Sub merged with and into\nTuHURA, with TuHURA surviving as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Kintara and the surviving corporation of the merger (the \"Merger”). In connection with the completion\nof the Merger, effective at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on the Closing Date, Kintara effected a 1-for-35 reverse stock split (the \"Reverse Stock Split”) of its common stock, par value\n$0.001 per share. Effective at 12:03 a.m. Eastern Time on the Closing Date, Kintara completed the merger, and effective at 12:04 a.m. Eastern Time on the Closing Date, Kintara\nchanged its name to \"TuHURA Biosciences, Inc.”\nUnder the terms of the Merger, at the effective time of the Merger, (i) Kintara issued an aggregate of approximately 40,441,605 shares of Common Stock to TuHURA stockholders,\nbased on an exchange ratio of 0.1789 (after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split) shares of Kintara’s common stock for each share of TuHURA common stock outstanding\nimmediately prior to the Merger, (ii) each then-outstanding TuHURA stock option was assumed and converted into an option to purchase shares of Kintara common stock subject\nto certain adjustments based on the exchange ratio as set forth in the Merger Agreement, and (iii) each then-outstanding warrant to purchase shares of TuHURA common stock\nwas assumed and converted into and exchangeable based on the exchange ratio for a warrant of like tenor entitling the holder to purchase shares of Kintara common stock.\nThe issuance of the shares of Kintara’s common stock to the former stockholders of TuHURA was registered with the SEC on the Kintara’s Registration Statement on Form S-4\n(File No. 333-279368), as amended.\nThe shares of Kintara’s common stock listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, previously trading through the close of business on Thursday, October 17, 2024 under the ticker\nsymbol \"KTRA,” commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on a post-Reverse Stock Split adjusted basis and post-Merger basis under the ticker symbol \"HURA” on\nFriday, October 18, 2024. Kintara’s common stock is represented by a new CUSIP number, 898920 103.\nIn connection with the Merger, Kintara entered into a Contingent Value Rights Agreement (the \"CVR Agreement”) with Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, pursuant to which the\nKintara common stock holders and Kintara common stock warrant holders of record as of immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger and Reverse Stock Split received\none contingent value right (a \"CVR”) for each outstanding share of common stock held by such stockholder (or, in the case of warrants, each share of common stock for which\nsuch warrant is exercisable into). Pursuant to the CVR Agreement, upon the achievement of (i) Kintara enrolling a minimum of ten cutaneous metastatic breast cancer patients in a\nstudy to determine whether a dose of Kintara’s REM-001 lower than 1.2 mg/kg elicits a treatment effect similar to that seen in prior studies of REM-001 at the 1.2 mg/kg dose and (ii)\nsuch patients enrolled in the study complete eight weeks of follow-up, in each case, on or before December 31, 2025, as set forth in the CVR Agreement (the holders of CVRs are\nentitled, in the aggregate, to receive approximately 1,539,918 shares of common stock (which gives effect to the Reverse Stock Split).\nUnless context otherwise requires, the use of \"we,” \"us,” \"our,” and the \"Company” in this Report refers to Kintara Therapeutics, Inc., a Nevada corporation pre-Merger and its\nwholly owned subsidiaries.\nExcept as otherwise expressly provided herein, the information in this Report does not reflect the consummation of the Merger, which, as discussed above, occurred subsequent\nto the period covered hereunder.\ni\nPART 1. - FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 1.

The Company is developing one late-stage therapeutic - REM-001 for cutaneous metastatic breast cancer (\"CMBC”). In\norder to accelerate the Company’s development timelines, it leverages existing preclinical and clinical data from a wide range of sources. The Company may seek marketing\npartnerships in order to potentially offset clinical costs and to generate future royalty revenue from approved indications of its current and future product candidates.\nMerger with TuHURA Biosciences, Inc.\nOn April 2, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger with TuHURA Biosciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\"TuHURA”), and Kayak\nMergeco, Inc., a Delaware corporation wholly owned subsidiary the Company (\"Merger Sub”), for an all-stock merger transaction (the \"Merger”) forming a company with expertise\nand resources to advance a risk diversified late-stage oncology pipeline (the \"Merger Agreement”). The Merger Agreement provided that, upon completion of the Merger, the\nformer TuHURA stockholders would own the majority of the shares of the Company. The Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement closed on\nOctober 18, 2024 (see note 10). Unless context otherwise requires, the use of \"we,” \"us,” \"our,” and the \"Company” in this Report refers to Kintara Therapeutics, Inc., a Nevada\ncorporation pre-Merger and its wholly owned subsidiaries.\nCorporate history\nThe Company is a Nevada corporation formed on June 24, 2009, under the name Berry Only, Inc. On January 25, 2013, the Company entered into and closed an exchange\nagreement (the \"Exchange Agreement”), with Del Mar Pharmaceuticals (BC) Ltd. (\"Del Mar (BC)”), 0959454 B.C. Ltd. (\"Callco”), and 0959456 B.C. Ltd. (\"Exchangeco”) and the\nsecurity holders of Del Mar (BC). Upon completion of the Exchange Agreement, Del Mar (BC) became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the \"Reverse Acquisition”).\nOn August 19, 2020, the Company completed its merger with Adgero Biopharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\"Adgero”) in which Adgero continued\nits existence under Delaware law and became a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Following the completion of the merger, the Company changed its name from\nDelMar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to Kintara Therapeutics, Inc. and began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market LLC (\"Nasdaq”) under the symbol \"KTRA”.\nKintara Therapeutics, Inc. is the parent company of Del Mar (BC), a British Columbia, Canada corporation and Adgero, which are clinical-stage companies with a focus on\nthe development of drugs for the treatment of cancer. The Company is also the parent company to Callco and Exchangeco which are British Columbia, Canada corporations. Callco\nand Exchangeco were formed to facilitate the Reverse Acquisition. In connection with the Adgero merger, the Company also became the parent company of Adgero\nBiopharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Adgero Bio”), formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adgero.\nOn October 18, 2024, the Company completed its merger with TuHURA and Merger Sub pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. In connection with the Merger,\nMerger Sub merged with and into TuHURA with TuHURA surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Following the completion of the Merger, the\nCompany changed its corporate name to \"TuHURA Biosciences, Inc.”\nReferences to the Company refer to the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nGoing concern and management plans\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that the Company will continue its operations for\nthe foreseeable future and contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported a loss of $2,161 and a negative cash flow from operations of $1,889. The Company had an\naccumulated deficit of $162,052 and had cash and cash equivalents of $3,020 as of\n7\nSeptember 30, 2024. The Company is in the clinical stage and has not generated any revenues to date. The Company does not have the prospect of achieving revenues until such\ntime that its product candidate is commercialized, or partnered, which may not ever occur. On August 2, 2022, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement under which\nthe Company has issued 19 shares of common stock for $2,008 in net proceeds as of September 30, 2024. In addition, on June 28, 2023, the Company announced that it had been\nawarded approximately $2,000 in grant funding to be received over a two-year period for its REM-001 project. During the year ended June 30, 2024, the Company issued an\nadditional 1,519 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $10,471 from its at-the-market (\"ATM”) facility, and announced that it is suspending the development of VAL-083.\nEven with the proceeds from the grant funding, the stock purchase financing, and the ATM sales, the Company will require additional funding to maintain its clinical trials,\nresearch and development projects, and for general operations.\nThese circumstances indicate substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of filing of these\ncondensed consolidated interim financial statements.\nOn October 18, 2024, the Company completed the Merger with TuHURA, on and subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement (Note 11).\nConsequently, management is pursuing various financing alternatives to fund the Company’s operations so it can continue as a going concern. Management plans to\ncontinue to pursue opportunities to secure the necessary financing through the issue of new equity, including debt, entering into strategic partnership arrangements, and/or\npursuing additional strategic transactions. However, the Company’s ability to raise additional capital could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including, but not limited\nto, global unrest. The Company may not be able to raise sufficient additional capital and may need to tailor its drug candidate development programs based on the amount of\nfunding the Company is able to raise in the future. Nevertheless, there is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful.\nThese condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be\nnecessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern, that may or may not be material to these condensed consolidated interim financial statements.\n2 Significant accounting policies\nReverse stock split\nOn November 10, 2022, the Company filed a Certificate of Change to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, as amended, in order to effectuate a 1:50 reverse stock split\n(the \"Reverse Stock Split”) of its issued and outstanding common stock as well as its authorized shares of common stock. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every 50 shares of\nissued and outstanding common stock were converted into one share of common stock with a proportionate reduction in the Company's authorized shares of common stock. Any\nfractional shares of common stock resulting from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the nearest whole post-Reverse Stock Split share. The Reverse Stock Split did not\nchange the par value of the Company's common stock. All outstanding securities entitling their holders to acquire shares of common stock were adjusted as a result of the Reverse\nStock Split. All common share and per share data are retrospectively restated to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented herein.\nBasis of presentation\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\n(\"U.S. GAAP”) and are presented in United States dollars. The functional currency of the Company and each of its subsidiaries is the United States dollar.\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Adgero, Adgero Bio, Del\nMar (BC), Callco, and Exchangeco. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are set out below and have been consistently\napplied to all periods presented.\nUnaudited interim financial data\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission (the \"SEC”) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and the notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete\nfinancial statements. These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the June 30, 2024, audited consolidated financial\nstatements of the Company included in the Company’s Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 7, 2024. In the opinion of\n8\nmanagement, the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair\npresentation. The results for three months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, or for any\nother future annual or interim period.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, contingent assets, and contingent liabilities as at the end of, or during, the reporting period. Actual results could significantly\ndiffer from those estimates. Significant areas requiring management to make estimates include the valuation of equity instruments issued for services, milestone payment liability,\nand clinical trial accruals. Further details of the nature of these assumptions and conditions may be found in the relevant notes to these condensed consolidated interim financial\nstatements.\nLoss per share\nLoss per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023,\ndiluted loss per share does not differ from basic loss per share since the effect of the Company’s warrants, stock options, restricted stock units, and convertible preferred shares is\nanti-dilutive. As of September 30, 2024, potential common shares of 17 (2023 – 20) related to outstanding common share warrants, nil (2023 – 1) related to outstanding Series C\npreferred stock warrants, 6 (2023 – 8) related to stock options, nil (2023 - 2) related to restricted stock units, and nil (2023 – 7) relating to outstanding Series C convertible preferred\nshares were excluded from the calculation of net loss per common share.\nGovernment assistance\nGovernment grants, including grants from similar bodies, are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the Company has met the requirements of the approved\ngrant program and there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received. Grants that compensate the Company for expenses incurred are recognized in income or loss in\nreduction thereof in the same period in which the expenses are recognized. The Company uses a net presentation basis whereby the grant offsets the research and development\nexpenses as it is being recovered under the grant program.\nRecently issued accounting standards\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s\ncondensed consolidated interim financial statements.\n3 Clinical trial deposit\nIn October 2020, the Company announced that it had entered into a final agreement with a contract research organization (\"CRO”) for the management of the Company’s\nregistrational study of VAL-083 for glioblastoma. Under the agreement, the Company supplied the drug for the study and the CRO managed all operational aspects of the study\nincluding site activation and patient enrollment. The Company was required to make certain payments under the agreement related to patient enrollment milestones. For the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, the Company has recognized an expense of $nil (2023 - $1,075) for this study in relation to clinical site initiation and patient enrollment.\nOn October 31, 2023, the Company announced that preliminary topline results from this registrational study for VAL-083 did not perform better than the current standards\nof care in glioblastoma. As a result, the Company announced that it has terminated the development of VAL-083. In the year ended June 30, 2024, the remaining deposit of $1,075\nwas offset against amounts owing to the CRO and the agreement with the CRO was terminated with an additional final cost of $1,000, which was paid in the year ended June 30,\n2024.\nAs of June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024, the Company has recorded $205 as a deposit with a CRO for the management of the Company’s 15-patient study of REM-001\nfor cutaneous metastatic breast cancer (\"CMBC”).\n4 Clinical trials grant\nEffective July 1, 2023, the Company was awarded a $2,000 Small Business Innovation Research grant from the National Institutes of Health (\"NIH”) to support the clinical\ndevelopment of REM-001 for the treatment of CMBC. The grant will be received in two tranches: approximately $1,250 for the period July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024, and\napproximately $750 for the period July 1, 2024, to June 30, 2025. As a result of receiving the grant, the REM-001, 15-patient clinical trial was restarted. The grant is expended\n9\nto the Company as a reimbursement of expenditures incurred. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received $236 (2023 - $13) for grants received\nagainst research and development expenditures in the period.\nThe grant is subject to various performance conditions and funding risk where the financial conditions of the NIH may change from time to time.

Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use to\nvalue an asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs are inputs based on assumptions about the factors\nmarket participants would use to value an asset or liability. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows:\n· Level one - inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n· Level two - inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly such as interest rates,\nforeign exchange rates, and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals; and\n· Level three - unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market\nparticipant would use.\nAssets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs\nmay result in a reclassification of levels for certain securities within the fair value hierarchy. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s milestone payment liability was measured\nusing level three inputs. The milestone payment liability relates to contingent milestone payments for the REM-001 program that was acquired in the Adgero merger (note 1).\nSeptember 30, 2024\nLiability Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nMilestone payment liability — — 188\n$\n(in thousands)\nBalance – June 30, 2024 186\nChange in fair value estimate 2\nBalance – September 30, 2024 188\nThe Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, accounts payable, and related party payables.

Ltd. (\"Callco”) and 0959456 B.C. Ltd. (\"Exchangeco”), which are British Columbia, Canada corporations. Callco and Exchangeco\nwere formed to facilitate the Reverse Acquisition that occurred in 2013.\nReferences to \"we,” \"us,” and \"our,” refer to Kintara and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Del Mar Pharmaceuticals (BC) Ltd. (\"Del Mar (BC)”), Adgero, Adgero\nBiopharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Adgero Bio”), Callco, and Exchangeco.\nWe are dedicated to the development of novel cancer therapies for patients with unmet medical needs. Our mission is to benefit patients by developing and\ncommercializing anti-cancer therapies for patients whose solid tumors exhibit features that make them resistant to, or unlikely to respond to, currently available therapies, with\nparticular focus on orphan cancer indications.\nOur lead candidate is REM-001, a late-stage photodynamic therapy (\"PDT”) for the treatment of cutaneous metastatic breast cancer (\"CMBC”). PDT is a treatment that\nuses light sensitive compounds, or photosensitizers, that, when exposed to specific wavelengths of light, act as a catalyst to produce a form of reactive oxygen that induces local\ntumor cell death.\nRecent Events\n•On October 4, 2024, the Company and Robert E. Hoffman, then-Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer of the Company, entered into an amendment (the\n\"Hoffman Amendment”) to that certain Executive Employment Agreement dated November 8, 2021 (the \"Hoffman Employment Agreement”), pursuant to which all\noutstanding stock options previously granted to Mr. Hoffman by the Company vested in full on October 4, 2024 in exchange for Mr. Hoffman agreeing to extend the non-\ncompetition restrictions of the Hoffman Employment Agreement for a period of twelve months following the date that his employment terminates with the Company.\n•On October 18, 2024, we completed a previously-announced definitive merger agreement (the \"Merger Agreement”) with Kayak Mergeco, Inc., a Delaware corporation and\nwholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (\"Merger Sub”), and TuHURA Biosciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\"TuHURA”), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged\nwith and into TuHURA, with TuHURA surviving the merger and becoming our direct, wholly-owned subsidiary (the \"Merger”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger,\nshareholders of TuHURA received shares of our common stock. Under the terms of the Merger, at the effective time of the Merger, (i) Kintara issued an aggregate of\napproximately 40,441,605 shares of common stock to TuHURA stockholders, based on an exchange ratio of 0.1789 (after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split) shares of\nKintara’s common stock for each share of TuHURA common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger, (ii) each then-outstanding TuHURA stock option was\nassumed and converted into an option to purchase shares of Kintara common stock subject to certain adjustments based on the exchange ratio as set forth in the Merger\nAgreement, and (iii) each then-outstanding warrant to purchase shares of TuHURA common stock was assumed and converted into\n17\nand exchangeable based on the exchange ratio for a warrant of like tenor entitling the holder to purchase shares of Kintara common stock.\n•Our stockholders existing as of the close of business on the business day immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger received one contingent value right(a\n\"CVR”), for each outstanding share Company common stock held by such stockholder (or, in the case of warrants to purchase Company common stock, each share of\ncommon stock for which such warrant is exercisable) entitling them to receive, in the aggregate, approximately 1,539,918 shares of our common stock upon achievement of\nenrollment of a minimum of 10 patients in the REM-001 Study, with such patients each completing eight weeks of follow-up on or before December 31, 2025 (the\n\"Milestone”). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, TuHURA stockholders as of immediately prior to the Merger owned, in aggregate and on a fully-diluted basis,\napproximately 97.15% of the Company (or 94.55% of the Company after giving effect to the issuance of the CVR Shares assuming the Milestone has been achieved) and\nCompany securityholders as of immediately prior to the Merger owned, in aggregate and on a fully-diluted basis, approximately 2.85% of the Company (or 5.45% of the\nCompany after giving effect to the issuance of the CVR Shares assuming the Milestone has been achieved).\n•Effective at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on October 18, 2024, we completed a 1-for-35 reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock. Our common stock began trading\non a reverse stock split-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq Capital Market on October 18, 2024 under the new name TuHURA Biosciences, Inc. and under the new symbol\n\"HURA\" following the closing of the Merger. The Company’s common stock is represented by a new CUSIP number, 898920 103.\nUpcoming Clinical Milestones\nEffective July 1, 2023, we were awarded a $2,000 grant from the National Institutes of Health (\"NIH”) to be received over a two-year period as expenses are incurred. The\ngrant from the NIH will fund the majority of expenses related to the REM-001 CMBC 15-patient clinical study (the \"REM-001 Study”). As a result of receiving the NIH grant, we re-\ninitiated our REM-001 program and have opened enrollment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where we have initiated treatment in a total of four patients as of November\n14, 2024. We expect to complete enrollment of patients in the REM-001 Study in the fourth calendar quarter of 2024.\nREM-001\nBackground\nThrough REM-001, we are developing our photodynamic therapy (\"PDT”) for the treatment of rare, unmet medical needs. PDT is a treatment that uses light sensitive\ncompounds, or photosensitizers, that, when exposed to specific wavelengths of light, act as catalysts to produce a form of oxygen that induces local tumor cell death. REM-001\nconsists of three parts: the laser light source, the light delivery device, and the REM-001 drug product (collectively, the \"REM-001 Therapy”). REM-001 consists of an active\npharmaceutical ingredient (\"API”) in a lipid formulation. The REM-001 API is SnET2 (\"tin ethyl etiopurpurin”) which is a second-generation PDT photosensitizer agent. We believe\nREM-001 possesses multiple advantages over earlier generation PDT compounds.\nOur lead indication for REM-001 is CMBC which is a disease that may strike individuals with advanced breast cancer and for which effective treatment options are limited.\nIn four Phase 2 and/or Phase 3 clinical studies in CMBC patients, primarily targeting patients who had previously received chemotherapy and failed radiation therapy, REM-001\nTherapy was able to reduce, or eliminate, a substantial number of the treated CMBC tumors. Specifically, our analysis of the data collected from these studies indicates that in\napproximately 80% of evaluable tumor sites treated with REM-001 Therapy, there was a complete response; meaning that follow-up clinical assessments indicated no visible\nevidence of the tumor remaining. We believe clinical data indicates that REM-001 Therapy holds promise as a treatment to locally eliminate, or slow the growth of, treated\ncutaneous cancerous tumors in this difficult-to-treat patient population.\nNumerous approaches have been utilized to treat CMBC patients, including various forms of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgical excision, hyperthermia,\ncryotherapy, electro-chemotherapy, topical drugs, and intra-lesional chemotherapy injections. However, for the most part, we believe that these therapies are often inadequate\ngiven the limited efficacy, toxicities and/or side effects of each. We believe our REM-001 Therapy has several advantages for this indication: it can be highly directed to the tumor\nsite, has minimal systemic effects or normal tissue toxicities, can be used in conjunction with other therapies, and can be periodically repeated.\nOur REM-001 Therapy product consists of three parts: the DD series laser light source (or equivalent), the ML2-0400 light delivery device (or equivalent) and the drug\nREM-001. In use, REM-001 is first administered by intravenous infusion and allowed to distribute within the body and be taken up by the tumors. Tumors are then illuminated with\nlight using the light delivery device, which is attached to the laser light source, so that the accumulated REM-001 can be activated for the desired clinical effect.\nAs a result of our review of the historical data, we submitted questions to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA”) under a Type C format to review the technology\nand results and determine the anticipated requirements for regulatory approval. On March 3, 2017, we received the FDA’s written response to these questions. Based on that\nresponse, we have successfully\n18\nmanufactured REM-001 and developed light delivery devices for our planned 15-patient Phase 2 study. We received a Study May Proceed letter from the FDA for our 15-patient\nstudy on August 9, 2022.\nOn October 19, 2022, we announced that the REM-001 program in CMBC was paused to conserve cash which will be used to support the funding of the GBM AGILE\nStudy. Effective July 1, 2023, we were awarded a two-year $2,000 Small Business Innovation Research grant from the National Institutes of Health to support the clinical\ndevelopment of REM-001 for the treatment of CMBC. The grant will be received in tranches of approximately $1,250 for the period July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024, and approximately\n$750 for the period July 1, 2024, to June 30, 2025. As a result of receiving the grant, we re-initiated our REM-001 program and have opened enrollment at Memorial Sloan Kettering\nCancer Center, where we have initiated treatment in a total of 4 patients as of November 14, 2024. We expect to complete enrollment of patients in the REM-001 Study in the fourth\ncalendar quarter of 2024.\nREM-001 Regulatory Filings\nOn August 9, 2022, we announced that we received a Study May Proceed letter from the FDA to begin our 15-patient study evaluating REM-001 PDT for the treatment of\nCMBC. The FDA has granted us Fast Track Designation (\"FTD”) for REM-001 in CMBC.\nVAL-083\nOn October 31, 2023, we announced preliminary topline results for VAL-083 from the GBM AGILE study. VAL-083 did not perform better than the current standards of care\nin glioblastoma and the preliminary safety data was similar to that of the current standards of care used to treat glioblastoma. As a result, we terminated the development of VAL-\n083. On February 13, 2024, we sent an Opt-Out Notice to Valent under the Valent Assignment Agreement whereby we assigned all rights, title, and interest in and to the patents for\nVAL-083 to Valent. As a result, we granted Valent a non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide and non-transferable license, subject to limited exceptions. We are\nentitled to receive royalties from Valent’s subsequent commercialization of VAL-083 equal to 5% of Valent Net Sales (as defined in the Valent Assignment Agreement).\nMerger Agreement\nSee \"Recent Events” above for a description of the Merger Agreement and transactions consummated thereby.\nCompensation Matters\nRobert E. Hoffman, former Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer of the Company, and the Company are parties to the Hoffman Employment Agreement,\nand on October 4, 2024, the Company and Mr. Hoffman entered into the Hoffman Amendment pursuant to the which, all outstanding stock options previously granted to Mr.\nHoffman by the Company vested in full on October 4, 2024 in exchange for Mr. Hoffman agreeing to extend the non-competition restrictions of the Hoffman Employment\nAgreement for a period of twelve months following the date that his employment terminates with the Company.\nCorporate History\nWe are a Nevada corporation formed on June 24, 2009, under the name Berry Only Inc. On January 25, 2013, we entered into and closed an exchange agreement (the\n\"Exchange Agreement”), with Del Mar (BC), Callco, and Exchangeco and the security holders of Del Mar (BC). Upon completion of the Exchange Agreement, Del Mar (BC) became\na wholly-owned subsidiary of ours (the \"Reverse Acquisition”).\nOn August 19, 2020, we acquired Adgero and changed our name from DelMar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to Kintara Therapeutics, Inc. We are the parent company to the\nfollowing entities:\n· Del Mar (BC), a British Columbia, Canada corporation incorporated on April 6, 2010, which is a clinical stage company with a focus on the development of drugs for the\ntreatment of cancer;\n· Adgero, a Delaware corporation incorporated on October 26, 2015, which is a clinical stage company with a focus on the development of photodynamic therapy for the\ntreatment of rare, unmet medical needs, specifically orphan cancer indications;\n· Adgero Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. a Delaware corporation incorporated on November 16, 2007; and\n· Callco and Exchangeco which are British Columbia, Canada corporations. Callco and Exchangeco were formed to facilitate the Reverse Acquisition.\nOn October 18, 2024, we completed the Merger with TuHURA, and following the consummation of the Merger, changed our name from Kintara Therapeutics, Inc. to\nTuHURA Biosciences, Inc.\n19\nOutstanding Securities\nAs of November 12, 2024, we had 42,284,524 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.\nSelected Quarterly Information\nThe financial information reported herein has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

The\ndisclosure has been provided to reconcile the total operational expenses on a GAAP basis and the non-GAAP operational expenses net of non-cash stock-based compensation in\norder to provide an estimate of cash used in research and development, and general and administrative expense. Management uses the cash basis of expenses for forecasting and\nbudget purposes to determine the allocation of resources and to plan for future financing opportunities.\n20\nFor the three months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023\n$ $\n(in thousands)\nResearch and development – GAAP 252 1,859\nLess: non-cash, share-based compensation expense (38) (86)\nResearch and development net of non-cash, share-based, compensation\nexpense – Non-GAAP 214 1,773\nGeneral and administrative – GAAP 1,957 1,103\nLess: non-cash, share-based compensation expense (63) (121)\nGeneral and administrative net of non-cash, share-based, compensation\nexpense – Non-GAAP 1,894 982\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023\nThree months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023\n$ $ Change $ Change %\n(in thousands)\nExpenses\nResearch and development 252 1,859 (1,607) (86)\nGeneral and administrative 1,957 1,103 854 77\n(2,209) (2,962) 753\nOther income (loss)\nForeign exchange (1) (2) 1 (50)\nInterest, net 49 2 47 2,350\n48 — 48\nNet loss (2,161) (2,962) 801\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses decreased to $252 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $1,859 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The\ndecrease was largely attributable to lower clinical development costs and related decreases in personnel and patent costs incurred during the three months ended September 30,\n2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to termination of the development of VAL-083 in October of 2023. Non-cash, share-based\ncompensation expense decreased to $38 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $86 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to the recognition of higher\ncompensation expense recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023, for stock options granted in August 2023.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $1,957 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1,103 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. A\nsignificant portion of the increase was a result of higher professional fees and special meeting fees incurred in relation to the transaction with TuHURA, offset by lower non-cash,\nshare-based compensation expenses and a reduction in travel costs in the current three months compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Non-cash, share-based\ncompensation expense decreased to $63 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $121 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to the recognition of higher\ncompensation expense recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2023, for stock options granted in August 2023. Personnel, facilities, office and sundry costs have\nincreased primarily due to special meeting costs, filing fees, and shareholder communication costs related to the transaction with TuHURA.\nPreferred Share Dividends\nFor each of the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we recorded $2 related to the cash dividend payable to Valent on the Series A Preferred Stock. The\ndividend has been recorded as a direct increase in accumulated deficit for both periods. In addition, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded $13 (2023 - $173)\nrelated to the stock dividend payable to investors on the Series C Preferred Stock. The dividends have been recorded as a direct increase in accumulated deficit for both periods.\n21\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThree months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 Change Change\n$ $ $ %\n(in thousands)\nCash flows from operating activities (1,889) (1,317) (572) 43\nCash flows from investing activities — — — 100\nCash flows from financing activities — (2) 2 (100)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $1,889 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1,317 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we reported net losses of $2,161 and $2,962, respectively. Adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating\nactivities for the three months ended September 30, 2024, included stock option expense of $98 and restricted stock unit expense of $3 being recognized during the current period\ncompared to $160 and $47, respectively, in the same period in the prior fiscal year.\nThe most significant change in working capital for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was related to a decrease in prepaid expenses, taxes and other receivables of\n$156. The most significant changes in working capital for the three months ended September 30, 2023, were related to the use of clinical trial deposit to settle clinical trial expenses\nof $1,075 and settlement of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $214.\nInvesting Activities\nThere was no investing activity during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $nil for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 for the\npayment of the quarterly Series A Preferred Share dividend, which was in accounts payable and accrued liabilities at September 30, 2024.\nGoing Concern and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nGoing Concern and Management Plans\n(See note 1 to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements)\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that we will continue our operations for the foreseeable\nfuture and contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, we reported a loss of $2,161 and a negative cash flow from operations of $1,889. We had an accumulated deficit of $162,052\nand had cash and cash equivalents of $3,020 as of September 30, 2024. We are in the clinical stage and have not generated any revenues to date. We do not have the prospect of\nachieving revenues until such time that our product candidate is commercialized, or partnered, which may not ever occur. On August 2, 2022, we entered into the Purchase\nAgreement under which we received approximately $2,008 in net proceeds as of September 30, 2024, for the issuance of an aggregate of 19 shares of common stock under the\nPurchase Agreement. On October 9, 2023, we received stockholder approval to issue 20% or more of our outstanding shares as of the date we entered into the Purchase Agreement\nwith Lincoln Park. On February 22, 2024, we determined that we have concluded utilization of the equity facility pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. In addition, on\nJune 28, 2023, we announced that we had been awarded approximately $2,000 in grant funding for our REM-001 project.\nOn September 19, 2023, we entered into a Sales Agreement, (the \"Sales Agreement”) with AGP pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, through AGP, as\nsales agent and/or principal, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $10,900 (the \"ATM Facility”). From October 31, 2023, until September 30, 2024, we\nraised $10,471 in net proceeds from the sale of 1,519 shares of our common stock under the ATM Facility. On February 22, 2024, we determined that we have concluded utilization\nof the ATM facility.\nEven with the proceeds from the grant funding, the stock purchase financing, and the ATM sales, we will require significant additional funding to maintain our clinical\ntrials, research and development projects, and for general operations. These circumstances\n22\nindicate substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of filing of these condensed consolidated financial statements.\nConsequently, management began pursuing various financing alternatives to fund our operations in the short and long term and so we can continue as a going concern. In\naddition, we initiated a process to explore and review a range of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing shareholder value, and as a result, entered into the Merger Agreement\nfor the Merger with TuHURA, which closed on October 18, 2024. Our ability to raise additional capital is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly\nuncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. We may not be able to raise sufficient additional capital and may tailor our drug candidate development program based on the\namount of funding we are able to raise in the future. Nevertheless, there is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful.\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements do not give effect to any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary\nshould we be unable to continue as a going concern. Such adjustments could be material.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:\n•the rate of progress and cost of our clinical studies, preclinical studies and other discovery and research and development activities;\n•the costs associated with establishing manufacturing and commercialization capabilities;\n•the costs of acquiring or investing in businesses, product candidates and technologies;\n•the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n•the costs and timing of seeking and obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals;\n•the effect of competing technological and market developments;\n•the economic and other terms and timing of any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter; and\n•the impact of us being a public entity.\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we expect to finance future cash needs primarily\nthrough public or private equity offerings, or strategic collaborations. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and certain of\nthose securities may have rights senior to those of our shares of capital stock. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of preferred stock, convertible debt securities or\nother debt financing, these securities or other debt could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Any other third-party funding arrangement could require us to\nrelinquish valuable rights. Economic conditions may affect the availability of funds and activity in equity markets. We do not know whether additional funding will be available on\nacceptable terms, or at all. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or\nresearch and development programs or make changes to our operating plan, file for bankruptcy protection or pursue a dissolution of the Company and liquidation of all of our\nremaining assets. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders, if any, will depend heavily on the timing of such decision, as with the passage\nof time the amount of cash available for distribution will be reduced as we continue to fund our operations. We cannot provide assurance as to the amount of cash that will be\navailable to distribute to shareholders, if any, after paying our debts and other obligations and setting aside funds for reserves, nor as to the timing of any such distribution, if any.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, requires companies to establish accounting\npolicies and to make estimates that affect both the amount and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Some of these estimates require judgments\nabout matters that are inherently uncertain and therefore actual results may differ from those estimates.\nA detailed presentation of all of our significant accounting policies and the estimates derived therefrom is included in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for\nthe year ended June 30, 2024, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on October 7, 2024. While all of the significant accounting policies are important to\nour consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies and the estimates derived therefrom are critical:\n· Fair value of financial instruments\n· Accruals for research and development expenses and clinical trials\n23\nFair value of financial instruments\nWe recognize compensation costs resulting from the issuance of stock-based awards to employees, non-employees and directors as an expense in the statement of\noperations over the service period based on a measurement of fair value for each stock-based award. Prior to our adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2018-07,\nCompensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting (\"ASU 2018-07”), stock options granted to non-employee\nconsultants were revalued at the end of each reporting period until vested using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the changes in their fair value were recorded as\nadjustments to expense over the related vesting period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the determination of grant-date fair value for stock option\nawards was estimated using the Black-Scholes model which includes variables such as the expected volatility of our share price, the anticipated exercise behavior of its grantee,\ninterest rates, and dividend yields. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we utilized the plain vanilla method to determine the expected life of stock options.\nThese variables are projected based on our historical data, experience, and other factors. Changes in any of these variables could result in material adjustments to the expense\nrecognized for share-based payments. Such value is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, net of actual forfeitures, using the accelerated attribution method. We\nrecognize forfeitures as they occur. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results, or updated estimates, differ from\ncurrent estimates, such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, we issued stock options to our officers. The determination of grant-date fair value for options granted was\nestimated using the Black-Scholes model which includes variables such as the expected volatility of our share price, interest rates, dividend yields, and the term of the option.\nAccruals for research and development expenses and clinical trials\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our expenses resulting from our obligations under contracts with vendors, clinical\nresearch organizations and consultants, and under clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials. The financial terms of these contracts are subject to\nnegotiations, which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment terms that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided under such\ncontracts. Our objective is to reflect the appropriate expenses in our financial statements by matching those expenses with the period in which services are performed and efforts\nare expended. We account for these expenses according to the timing of various aspects of the expenses. We determine accrual estimates by taking into account discussion with\napplicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress of clinical trials, or the services completed. During the course of a clinical trial, we adjust our clinical expense\nrecognition if actual results differ from our estimates. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on the facts and circumstances known to us\nat that time. Our clinical trial accruals are dependent upon the timely and accurate reporting of contract research organizations and other third-party vendors. Although we do not\nexpect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and\ntiming of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any particular period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024,\nand 2023, there were no material adjustments to our prior period estimates of accrued expenses for clinical trials.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\n24\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nNot required for a smaller reporting company.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period\ncovered by this Form 10-Q, has concluded that, based on such evaluation, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be\ndisclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules\nand forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as\nappropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit\nrelationship of possible controls and procedures.\n(b) Changes in Internal Controls.

Enters into Definitive Merger Agreement to Acquire\nKineta, Inc.\nOpportunistic acquisition adds Phase 2 novel checkpoint inhibitor\n(KVA12123) to TuHURA’s late stage pipeline\nTargeting Phase 2a/b trial with KVA12123 in mutated NPM1 AML in 2025\nCross product and technology synergies build on TuHURA’s therapeutic focus\non overcoming primary and acquired resistance to cancer immunotherapy\nProposed Transaction expected to close in Q1 2025\nTAMPA, FL and SEATTLE, WA, December 12, 2024 – TuHURA Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: HURA) (“TuHURA”), a Phase 3 registration-stage immune-\noncology company developing novel technologies to overcome resistance to cancer immunotherapy, and Kineta, Inc. (OTC Pink: KANT) (“Kineta”), a\nclinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of novel immunotherapies in oncology that address cancer immune resistance, today\nannounced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement in which TuHURA would acquire Kineta, including the rights to Kineta’s novel\nKVA12123 antibody, for a combination of cash and shares of TuHURA common stock via a merger transaction (the “Proposed Transaction”).\n“We are pleased to have entered into this definitive agreement with Kineta, which represents the culmination of the Exclusivity and Right of First Offer\nAgreement that TuHURA and Kineta entered into in July 2024. Our strategy of providing Kineta this past summer with a $5 million exclusivity fee to\nrestart and finish their Phase 1 monotherapy and combination with pembrolizumab trial demonstrated our view that the PK/PD profile would position\nKVA12123 as a potential best-in-class V-domain Ig suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA)-inhibiting antibody. We believe the real potential for this\nclass of checkpoint inhibitors resides in the treatment of blood related cancers. The data presented at the December 2024 ASH meeting indicates a strong\ncorrelation between NPM1 mutations (mNPM1) and elevated VISTA expression, particularly in the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where high\nVISTA levels on leukemia cells, associated with mNPM1, can potentially contribute to immune evasion and disease progression impacting their treatment\nresponse. Given mNPM1 drives leukemogenesis through menin, and the introduction of menin inhibitors improving treatment responses in mNPM1-\nassociated AML, a combination with a VISTA-inhibiting antibody could be the next step in improving response rates in AML,” commented James\nBianco, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of TuHURA.\nKVA12123 is a VISTA-blocking immunotherapy in development as a monoclonal antibody infusion drug dosed every two-week cycles. It is completing\ntwo clinical trials both as a monotherapy and in combination with Merck’s anti-PD1 therapy, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), in patients with advanced\ntreatment-refractory solid tumors. Competitive therapies targeting VISTA have demonstrated either poor monotherapy anti-tumor activity in preclinical\nmodels or induction of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in human clinical trials. Through the combination of unique epitope binding and an optimized\nIgG1 Fc region, KVA12123 demonstrates strong monotherapy tumor growth inhibition in preclinical models without evidence of CRS in clinical trial\nparticipants. KVA12123 has been shown to de-risk the VISTA target and provides a novel approach to address immune suppression in the tumor\nmicroenvironment (TME) with a mechanism of action that is differentiated and complementary with T cell focused therapies. KVA12123 may be an\neffective immunotherapy for many types of cancer and represents the introduction of a new class of checkpoint inhibitors.\nVISTA is a negative immune checkpoint that suppresses T cell function in a variety of solid tumors. High VISTA expression in tumor correlates with poor\nsurvival in cancer patients and has been associated with a lack of response to other immune checkpoint inhibitors. Blocking VISTA induces an efficient\npolyfunctional immune response to address immunosuppression and drives anti-tumor responses.\nKVA12123 has completed enrollment in its monotherapy arm, demonstrating safety at its highest dose level (1000mg). Kineta anticipates completion of\nenrollment in the combination therapy arm where KVA12123 is administered with Merck’s anti-PD1 therapy, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab). Initial results\nwere reported earlier this year at the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024 and at the Society for Immunotherapy of\nCancer (SITC) meeting, supporting best-in-class profile.\n“Following a thorough review of exploring strategic alternatives for Kineta and the discussions held with TuHURA over the course of the past several\nmonths, we believe this acquisition by TuHURA maximizes shareholder value and provides an exciting development path forward for KVA12123. We\nbelieve KVA12123 has multiple synergies with both of TuHURA’s IFx and Delta receptor antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) and peptide drug conjugate\n(PDC) technologies and that a TuHURA acquisition will provide the necessary resources to advance KVA12123 through its clinical development,\nmaximizing value for Kineta’s shareholders,” said Craig W. Philips, President of Kineta. “In addition to the TuHURA transaction, Kineta is continuing to\npursue partnership opportunities for some of its other non-KVA12123-related products and technologies prior to the close of the TuHURA transaction.”\nAbout the Proposed Transaction\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, upon the completion of the Proposed Transaction, Kineta stockholders will receive their pro rata share (based\non the number of Kineta fully diluted shares held by them) of aggregate merger consideration consisting of a combination of cash and shares of\nTuHURA common stock. The cash component of the aggregate merger consideration will be a base cash amount of $9,005,000 (consisting of a value of\n$15,000,000 minus the $5,995,000 advanced to Kineta under the Exclusivity and Right of First Offer Agreement) less the sum of Kineta’s working capital\ndeficit at the closing of the Proposed Transaction and any working\ncapital loans made by TuHURA to Kineta between the signing of the merger agreement and closing of the Proposed Transaction. The share component\nof the aggregate merger consideration will consist of an aggregate of up to approximately 3,476,568 shares of TuHURA common stock, subject to a\nsix-month holdback of approximately 869,142 of such shares to satisfy certain additional liabilities of the closing date that may be identified after the\nclosing. As additional merger consideration, Kineta stockholders will be entitled to receive their pro rata share of certain payments that Kineta may\nreceive after the closing from the potential pre-closing sale by Kineta of certain non-KVA12123 products and technologies.\nIn connection with the merger agreement, TuHURA and Kineta entered into a Clinical Trial Funding Agreement under which TuHURA agreed to continue\nto fund clinical trial expenses for KVA12123 in an amount of up to $900,000, which may be increased upon mutual agreement. The merger agreement also\nprovides that Kineta may request the extension of up to $2,000,000 in working capital loans from TuHURA, $1,750,000 of which will be contingent on the\ncompletion of a financing transaction by TuHURA.\nThe merger agreement has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is subject to Kineta stockholder approval. The\ncompletion of the Proposed Transaction is also subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain other conditions, such as the approval by TuHURA’s\nstockholders of an increase in the number of authorized shares of TuHURA common stock, Kineta’s working capital deficit not exceeding $12,000,000 at\nthe time of closing, the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 registering the shares of TuHURA common stock issuable to the Kineta\nstockholders in the Proposed Transaction, and other customary closing conditions. The Proposed Transaction is currently expected to close in the first\nquarter of 2025.\nAbout TuHURA Biosciences, Inc.\nTuHURA Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: HURA) is a Phase 3 registration-stage immuno-oncology company developing novel technologies to overcome\nprimary and acquired resistance to cancer immunotherapy, two of the most common reasons cancer immunotherapies fail to work or stop working in the\nmajority of patients with cancer.\nTuHURA’s lead innate immune agonist candidate, IFx-2.0, is designed to overcome primary resistance to checkpoint inhibitors. TuHURA is preparing to\ninitiate a single randomized placebo-controlled Phase 3 registration trial of IFx-2.0 administered as an adjunctive therapy to Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) in\nfirst line treatment for advanced or metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma.\nIn addition to its innate immune agonist candidates, TuHURA is leveraging its Delta receptor technology to develop first-in-class bi-specific ADCs and\nPDCs targeting Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells to inhibit their immune-suppressing effects on the TME to prevent T cell exhaustion and acquired\nresistance to checkpoint inhibitors and cellular therapies.\nFor more information, please visit tuhurabio.com and connect with TuHURA on Facebook, X, and LinkedIn.\nAbout Kineta\nKineta, Inc. (OTC Pink: KANT) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a mission to develop next-generation immunotherapies that transform\npatients’ lives. Kineta has leveraged its expertise in innate immunity and is focused on discovering and developing potentially differentiated\nimmunotherapies that address the major challenges with current cancer therapy. Kineta’s immuno-oncology pipeline includes KVA12123, a novel VISTA\nblocking immunotherapy currently in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors, and a preclinical monoclonal antibody targeting\nCD27. For more information on Kineta, please visit www.kinetabio.com.\nThrough the combination of unique epitope binding and an optimized IgG1 Fc region, KVA12123 has demonstrated strong tumor growth inhibition as\nboth a monotherapy and in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors in preclinical models. KVA12123 provides a novel approach to address immune\nsuppression in the TME with a mechanism of action that is differentiated and complementary with T cell focused therapies. KVA12123 may be an\neffective immunotherapy for many types of cancer including non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), colorectal, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck, and\novarian cancer.\nIn February 2024, Kineta announced a significant corporate restructuring to substantially reduce expenses and preserve cash. The restructuring included\na significant workforce reduction and the suspension of enrollment of new patients in its ongoing VISTA-101 Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating KVA12123\nin patients with advanced solid tumors. At that time, Kineta also announced that it was exploring strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value.\nAdditional Information About the Proposed Transaction for Investors and Shareholders\nIn connection with the Proposed Transaction between TuHURA and Kineta TuHURA and Kineta intend to file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the “SEC”) a Registration Statement on Form S-4 that will contain a preliminary prospectus of TuHURA and a proxy statement of Kineta in\nconnection with the Proposed Transaction, referred to as a proxy statement/prospectus.

(Nasdaq: HURA) (“TuHURA” or the “Company”), a Phase 3 registration-stage\nimmune-oncology company developing novel technologies to overcome resistance to cancer immunotherapy, today provided a business update\nand outlined upcoming targeted milestones.\n“We have made significant progress toward accomplishing our 2024 corporate objectives, including reaching a Special Protocol Assessment\nagreement with the FDA by working with the Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE) and FDA’s Project Front Runner initiative for a novel Phase 3\ntrial design for IFx-2.0 under the FDA’s accelerated approval pathway. This single registration directed trial, in addition to its primary endpoint of\nOverall Response Rate (ORR), it will also incorporate a key secondary endpoint of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) that, if achieved, can satisfy the\nrequirement for a post-approval confirmatory trial, potentially converting accelerated approval to full approval,” commented James Bianco, M.D.,\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer of TuHURA. “We have also advanced our efforts toward the potential acquisition of KVA12123, a novel VISTA\ninhibiting antibody, with a non-binding letter of intent, which would bring to our pipeline a Phase 2 ready candidate with therapeutic synergies\nacross our pipeline and\ntechnologies, all while becoming a NASDAQ-listed Company after having raised significant capital adequate to advance our current programs late\ninto the second half of 2025.”\nAdvancing Novel Technologies to Overcome Resistance to Cancer Immunotherapy\nInnate Immune Response Agonists: TuHURA’s IFx technology utilizes a proprietary plasmid DNA or messenger RNA (“mRNA”) which, when\nintroduced into or targeted to a tumor, results in the expression of a highly immunogenic gram-positive, bacterial protein (Emm55) on the surface\nof the tumor cell, making the tumor look like a bacterium. Gram-positive bacterium has molecular patterns, or motifs, preserved over evolution\nwhich are recognized by receptors on our immune cells called toll like receptors (TLR). TLR 2 specifically recognizes the pattern of gram-positive\nbacterial proteins, like Emm55 leading to the activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs). Once activated, APCs digest the tumor cell and present\nnon-self, tumor neoantigens to newly produced T and B cells, activating a tumor-specific adaptive immune response. Through its activation of\ntumor specific T cells, IFx-2.0 administration can potentially overcome primary resistance to checkpoint inhibitors.\nTuHURA is preparing to initiate a single, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 accelerated approval trial of IFx-2.0 administered as an\nadjunctive therapy to Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) versus pembrolizumab plus placebo in first line treatment for checkpoint inhibitor-naïve patients\nwith advanced or metastatic MCC. The data from the Company’s Phase 1b trial in patients with advanced or metastatic MCC who exhibited\nprimary resistance to CPI was used to support a potential single registration directed trial. Consistent with the FDA’s Project Front Runner\nInitiative, the FDA’s OCE recommended investigating IFx-2.0 in the first line setting rather than in patients progressing on first line therapy.\nProject Front Runner is an FDA OCE initiative to encourage drug sponsors to consider when it may be appropriate to first develop and seek\napproval of new cancer drugs for advanced or metastatic disease, in an earlier clinical setting rather than the usual approach to develop and seek\napproval of a new drug for treatment of patients who have received numerous prior lines of therapies or have exhausted available treatment\noptions.\nThe FDA also encouraged the Company to consider designing the trial to include a key secondary endpoint shown to be of clinical benefit like PFS\nallowing this accelerated approval trial to potentially satisfy both the requirements for accelerated approval based on ORR, while satisfying the\nrequirement for a post-approval confirmatory trial if the secondary PFS endpoint is achieved. The trial will be conducted under an SPA agreement\nwith the FDA.\nTumor Microenvironment Modulators: Leveraging its Delta receptor technology, TuHURA is developing bi-specific immune modulating ADCs or\nPDCs targeting MDSCs to inhibit their immune suppressing effects on the tumor microenvironment to prevent T cell exhaustion and acquired\nresistance to checkpoint inhibitors and cellular therapies.\nPotential Acquisition of Novel Anti-VISTA Checkpoint Inhibitor: As previously announced on July 8, 2024, TuHURA entered into an Exclusivity\nand Right of First Offer Agreement with Kineta, Inc.\n(OTC Pink: KANT) for the potential acquisition of Kineta's KVA12123 VISTA inhibiting antibody. TuHURA has continued to engage in discussions\nand negotiations with Kineta and has entered into a non-binding letter of intent regarding a potential transaction in which TuHURA would acquire\nthe rights to KVA12123 for a combination of cash and shares of TuHURA common stock via a merger transaction structure.\nKVA12123 has completed enrollment in its monotherapy arm, demonstrating safety at its highest dose level (1000mg). Kineta anticipates\ncompletion of enrollment in the combination therapy arm where KVA12123 is administered with Merck's anti-PD1 therapy, KEYTRUDA®\n(pembrolizumab). Initial results were reported earlier this year at the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024 and\nrecently at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) meeting.\nUpcoming Milestone Targets\nTuHURA is targeting the achievement of the following potential milestones for the remainder of 2024 and 2025:\n•Q4 2024: Reach a potential definitive agreement for acquisition of KVA12123 VISTA inhibiting antibody via merger with Kineta, subject to\ncontinuing diligence and negotiations with Kineta\n•H1 2025: Initiate IFx-2.0 Phase 3 trial\n•H1 2025: IFx-2.0 Inhibitor Resistant “basket” trial\n•H1 2025: Complete potential acquisition of transaction involving Kineta’s KVA12123\n•H2 2025: Commence VISTA inhibiting Mab Phase 2 trials (if Kineta merger transaction has been completed)\n•H2 2025: Bi-specific MDSC targeted ADC in vivo POC\n•H2 2025: IFx-3.0: CD22+ tumor targeted mRNA in vivo POC studies\nREM-001\nThe legacy asset from the completed merger with Kintara Therapeutics, Inc., REM-001, is a late-stage photodynamic therapy (\"PDT”) currently\nbeing evaluated in an open-label 15- patient study for the treatment of cutaneous metastatic breast cancer. As of October 7, 2024, four patients\nhad been dosed. The Company currently expects to complete enrollment in Q4 2024. Based on the Company’s strategic focus on advancing its\ntechnologies that seek to overcome the major obstacles that limit the effectiveness of current immunotherapies in treating cancer, TuHURA plans\nto seek licensing opportunities for REM-001.\nIn connection with the completed merger with Kintara, existing stockholders of Kintara received contingent value rights entitling them to receive\nadditional shares of TuHURA common stock upon achievement of enrollment of a minimum of 10 patients in the REM-001 Study, with such\npatients each completing 8 weeks of follow-up on or before December 31, 2025.\nKey Management Hires to Advance Development\nThe Company also announced the key management appointments of Peter O’Neill as Vice President, Clinical Operations and Michael Krsulich as\nHead of Quality Assurance.\nPeter O’Neill\nMr. O’Neill brings over 25 years of clinical trial experience, having led large and small Clinical Operations teams at sponsors (Biotech/Pharma),\nCROs and research hospitals.
