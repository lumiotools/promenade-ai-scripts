          "content": "BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nNEWS RELEASE\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE November 25, 2024\nOmaha, NE (BRK.A; BRK.B) –\nToday, Warren E. Buffett will convert 1,600 A shares into 2,400,000 B shares in order to give these B\nshares to four family foundations: 1,500,000 shares to The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation and\n300,000 shares to each of The Sherwood Foundation, The Howard G. Buffett Foundation and NoVo\nFoundation.\nMr. Buffett’s comments to his fellow shareholders follow:\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nThe gifts I am making today reduce my holdings of Berkshire Hathaway Class A shares to\n206,363, a 56.6% decrease since my 2006 pledge. In 2004, before Susie, my first wife, died, the two\nof us owned 508,998 Class A shares. For decades, we had both thought that she would outlive me and\nsubsequently distribute the vast majority of our large fortune. That was not to be.\nWhen Susie died, her estate was roughly $3 billion, with about 96% of this sum going to our\nfoundation. Additionally, she left $10 million to each of our three children, the first large gift we had\ngiven to any of them. These bequests reflected our belief that hugely wealthy parents should leave\ntheir children enough so they can do anything but not enough that they can do nothing.\nSusie and I had long encouraged our children in small philanthropic activities and had been\npleased with their enthusiasm, diligence and results. At her death, however, they were not ready to\nhandle the staggering wealth that Berkshire shares had generated. Nevertheless, their philanthropic\nactivities were dramatically increased by the 2006 lifetime pledge that I subsequently made and later\nexpanded.\nThe children have now more than justified our hopes and, upon my death, will have full\nresponsibility for gradually distributing all of my Berkshire holdings. These now account for 99½%\nof my wealth.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nFather time always wins. But he can be fickle – indeed unfair and even cruel – sometimes\nending life at birth or soon thereafter while, at other times, waiting a century or so before paying a\nvisit. To date, I’ve been very lucky, but, before long, he will get around to me.\nThere is, however, a downside to my good fortune in avoiding his notice. The expected life\nspan of my children has materially diminished since the 2006 pledge. They are now 71, 69 and 66.\n1\nI’ve never wished to create a dynasty or pursue any plan that extended beyond the children. I\nknow the three well and trust them completely. Future generations are another matter. Who can\nforesee the priorities, intelligence and fidelity of successive generations to deal with the distribution\nof extraordinary wealth amid what may be a far different philanthropic landscape? Still, the massive\nwealth I’ve collected may take longer to deploy than my children live. And tomorrow’s decisions are\nlikely to be better made by three live and well-directed brains than by a dead hand.\nAs such, three potential successor trustees have been designated. Each is well known to my\nchildren and makes sense to all of us. They are also somewhat younger than my children.\nBut these successors are on the wait list. I hope Susie, Howie and Peter themselves disburse\nall of my assets.\nEach respects my wish that the disposition program for my holdings of Berkshire shares in no\nway betrays the exceptional trust Berkshire shareholders bestowed upon Charlie Munger and me. The\n2006-2024 period gave me the chance to observe each of my children in action and they have learned\nmuch about large-scale philanthropy and human behavior. Each has overseen teams of 20-30 for\nmany years and has observed the unique employment dynamics affecting philanthropic\norganizations.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nWealthy friends have been curious about the extraordinary confidence I have in my children\nand their possible alternates. They express particular surprise at my requirement that all foundation\nactions will require a unanimous vote. How can this be workable?\nI’ve explained that my children will forever be besieged with earnest requests from very\nsincere friends and others. A second reality: When large philanthropic gifts are requested, a “no”\nfrequently prompts would-be grantees to ponder a different approach – another friend, a different\nproject, whatever. Those who can distribute huge sums are forever regarded as “targets of\nopportunity.” This unpleasant reality comes with the territory.\nHence, the “unanimous decision” provision. That restriction enables an immediate and final\nreply to grant-seekers: “It’s not something that would ever receive my brother’s consent.” And that\nanswer will improve the lives of my children.\nMy unanimity clause, of course, is not a panacea – it clearly isn’t workable if you have nine\nor ten children or stepchildren. And it doesn’t solve the daunting problem of intelligently distributing\nmany billions annually.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nI have one further suggestion for all parents, whether they are of modest or staggering\nwealth. When your children are mature, have them read your will before you sign it.\nBe sure each child understands both the logic for your decisions and the responsibilities they\nwill encounter upon your death. If any have questions or suggestions, listen carefully and adopt those\nfound sensible. You don’t want your children asking “Why?” in respect to testamentary decisions\nwhen you are no longer able to respond.\nOver the years, I have had questions or commentary from all three of my children and have\noften adopted their suggestions. There is nothing wrong with my having to defend my thoughts. My\ndad did the same with me.\n2\nI change my will every couple of years – often only in very minor ways – and keep things\nsimple. Over the years, Charlie and I saw many families driven apart after the posthumous dictates of\nthe will left beneficiaries confused and sometimes angry. Jealousies, along with actual or imagined\nslights during childhood, became magnified, particularly when sons were favored over daughters,\neither in monetary ways or by positions of importance.\nCharlie and I also witnessed a few cases where a wealthy parent’s will that was fully\ndiscussed before death helped the family become closer. What could be more satisfying?\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAs I write this, I continue my lucky streak that began in 1930 with my birth in the United\nStates as a white male. My two sisters had, of course, been explicitly promised by the 19th\nAmendment’s enactment in 1920 that they would be treated equally with males. This, after all, had\nbeen the message of our thirteen colonies in 1776.\nIn 1930, however, I emerged in a country that hadn’t yet gotten around to fulfilling its earlier\naspirations. Aided by Billie Jean King, Sandra Day O’Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, and countless\nothers, things began changing in the 1970s.\nSo favored by my male status, very early on I had confidence that I would become rich. But\nin no way did I, or anyone else, dream of the fortunes that have become attainable in America during\nthe last few decades. It has been mind-blowing – beyond the imaginations of Ford, Carnegie, Morgan\nor even Rockefeller. Billions became the new millions.\nThings didn’t look great when I arrived at the beginning of The Great Depression. But the\nreal action from compounding takes place in the final twenty years of a lifetime. By not stepping on\nany banana peels, I now remain in circulation at 94 with huge sums in savings – call these units of\ndeferred consumption – that can be passed along to others who were given a very short straw at birth.\nI am also lucky that my philanthropic philosophy has been enthusiastically embraced – and\nwidened – by both of my wives. Neither I, Susie Sr. nor Astrid, who succeeded her, believed in\ndynastic wealth.\nInstead, we shared a view that equal opportunity should begin at birth and extreme “look-at-\nme” styles of living should be legal but not admirable. As a family, we have had everything we\nneeded or simply liked, but we have not sought enjoyment from the fact that others craved what we\nhad.\nIt also has been a particular pleasure to me that so many early Berkshire shareholders have\nindependently arrived at a similar view. They have saved – lived well – taken good care of their\nfamilies – and by extended compounding of their savings passed along large, sometimes huge, sums\nback into society. Their “claim checks” are being widely distributed to others less lucky.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nWith this philosophy, I have lived the way I wanted to live since my late 20s, and I have now\nwatched my children grow into good and productive citizens. They have different views in many\ncases from both me and their siblings but have common values that are unwavering.\n3\nSusie Jr., Howie and Peter have each spent far more time directly helping others than I have.\nThey enjoy being comfortable financially, but they are not preoccupied with wealth. Their mother,\nfrom whom they learned these values, would be very proud of them.\nAs am I.\nAbout Berkshire\nBerkshire Hathaway and its subsidiaries engage in diverse business activities including insurance and\nreinsurance, utilities and energy, freight rail transportation, manufacturing, services and retailing.\nCommon stock of the company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, trading symbols BRK.A\nand BRK.B.\n— END —\nContact\nMarc D.

Buffett will convert 8,674 A shares into 13,011,000 B shares in order to donate\n13,008,758 shares of Berkshire Hathaway “B” stock to five foundations: 9,930,357 to the Bill & Melinda\nGates Foundation Trust, 993,035 shares to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation and 695,122 shares to\neach of the Sherwood Foundation, Howard G. Buffett Foundation and NoVo Foundation. The donations\nwill be delivered today.\nMr. Buffett’s ownership of Berkshire now consists of 207,963 A shares and 2,586 B shares.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nMr. Buffett’s comments follow:\n“The mathematics of the lifetime commitments to the five foundations are interesting. The schedule\nfor annual grants was made on June 26, 2006, and has since been supplemented by significant grants to\nfour of the five recipients. When originally made, I owned 474,998 Berkshire A shares worth about $43\nbillion and those shares represented more than 98% of my net worth. I have converted A shares into B\nshares before making contributions.\nDuring the following 18 years, I have neither bought nor sold any A or B shares nor do I intend to\ndo so. The five foundations have received Berkshire B shares with a value when received of about $55\nbillion, substantially more than my entire net worth in 2006. I have no debts and my remaining A shares\nare worth about $127 billion, roughly 99½% of my net worth.\nNothing extraordinary has occurred at Berkshire; a very long runway, simple but generally sound\ncapital deployment, the American tailwind and compounding effects produced my current wealth. My will\nprovides that more than 99% of my estate is destined for philanthropic usage.\nThe lifetime commitments expire upon my death or at an earlier time if certain conditions set forth\nin the 2006 letter occur. All of these conditions continue to be met.\nMy November 21, 2023 letter set forth procedures of my will that are unlikely to be changed before\nmy death. My then-current will becomes public upon my death.”\nAbout Berkshire\nBerkshire Hathaway and its subsidiaries engage in diverse business activities including insurance and\nreinsurance, utilities and energy, freight rail transportation, manufacturing, retailing and services. Common\nstock of the company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, trading symbols BRK.A and BRK.B.\n— END —\nContact\nMarc D. Hamburg\n402-346-1400"

(Dollar amounts are in\nmillions, except for per share amounts).\nFourth Quarter Full Year\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nNet earnings (loss) attributable to Berkshire shareholders ...... $ 37,5 74 $ 18,080 $ 96,223 $ (22,759)\nNet earnings (loss) includes:\nInvestment and derivative gains (losses) ............................ 29,0 93 11,455 58,873 (53,612)\nOperating earnings ............................................................. 8,4 81 6,625 37,350 30,853\nNet earnings (loss) attributable to Berkshire shareholders ...... $ 37,5 74 $ 18,080 $ 96,223 $ (22,759)\nNet earnings (loss) per average equivalent Class A Share ..... $ 26,0 43 $ 12,355 $ 66,412 $ (15,494)\nNet earnings (loss) per average equivalent Class B Share...... $ 17 . 36 $ 8.24 $ 44.27 $ (10.33)\nAverage equivalent Class A shares outstanding ...................... 1,442,7 85 1,463,422 1,448,880 1,468,876\nAverage equivalent Class B shares outstanding ...................... 2,164,177,6 36 2,195,133,576 2,173,319,709 2,203,313,642\nNote: Per share amounts for the Class B shares are 1/1,500th of those shown for the Class A.\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) require that we include the changes in unrealized\ngains/losses of our equity security investments as a component of investment gains/losses in our earnings\nstatements. In the table above, investment gains (losses) in 2023 include gains of $29.5 billion in the fourth quarter\nand $53.0 billion in the full year and in 2022 include gains of $10.1 billion in the fourth quarter and losses of $53.8\nbillion in the full year due to changes during the fourth quarter and the full year in the unrealized gains that existed\nin our equity security investment holdings. Investment gains (losses) in 2023 also include after-tax realized losses\non sales of investments of $330 million in the fourth quarter and after-tax realized gains of $3.6 billion in the full\nyear and in 2022 include after-tax realized gains on sales of investments of $1.0 billion in the fourth quarter and\n$54 million in the full year. In 2023 investment gains also include a net remeasurement gain of approximately $2.4\nbillion related to Berkshire’s acquisition of an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot Travel Centers.\nThe amount of investment gains/losses in any given quarter is usually meaningless and delivers figures for net\nearnings (losses) per share that can be extremely misleading to investors who have little or no knowledge of\naccounting rules.\nAn analysis of Berkshire’s operating earnings follows (dollar amounts are in millions).\nFourth Quarter Full Year\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nInsurance-underwriting ............................................... $ 848 $ 160 $ 5,428 $ (30)\nInsurance-investment income ..................................... 2,759 2,000 9,567 6,484\nRailroad ...................................................................... 1,355 1,469 5,087 5,946\nUtilities and energy ..................................................... 632 739 2,331 3,904\nOther businesses ......................................................... 3,691 3,709 15,112 14,040\nOther* ......................................................................... (804) (1,452) (175) 509\nOperating earnings ...................................................... $ 8,481 $ 6,625 $37,350 $30,853\n* Includes foreign currency exchange losses related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt of approximately $684 million in\nthe fourth quarter and gains of approximately $211 million in the full year in 2023 and in 2022 includes foreign currency\nexchange losses of approximately $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter and gains of approximately $1.3 billion in the full year.\nApproximately $2.2 billion was used to repurchase Berkshire shares during the fourth quarter of 2023 bringing the\ntotal for the year to approximately $9.2 billion. On December 31, 2023 there were 1,441,483 Class A equivalent\nshares outstanding. At December 31, 2023, insurance float (the net liabilities we assume under insurance\ncontracts) was approximately $169 billion, an increase of $5 billion since yearend 2022.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliations of such measures to the\nmost comparable GAAP figures in accordance with Regulation G are included herein.\nBerkshire presents its results in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful, as well as most transparent,\nto the investing public and others who use Berkshire’s financial information. That presentation includes the use of\ncertain non-GAAP financial measures. In addition to the GAAP presentations of net earnings, Berkshire shows\noperating earnings defined as net earnings exclusive of investment and derivative gains/losses and impairments of\ngoodwill and intangible assets.\nAlthough the investment of insurance and reinsurance premiums to generate investment income and investment\ngains or losses is an integral part of Berkshire’s operations, the generation of investment gains or losses is\nindependent of the insurance underwriting process. Moreover, as previously described, under applicable GAAP\naccounting requirements, we are required to include the changes in unrealized gains/losses of our equity security\ninvestments as a component of investment gains/losses in our periodic earnings statements. In sum, investment\ngains/losses for any particular period are not indicative of quarterly business performance.\nAbout Berkshire\nBerkshire Hathaway and its subsidiaries engage in diverse business activities including insurance and reinsurance,\nutilities and energy, freight rail transportation, manufacturing, retailing and services. Common stock of the\ncompany is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, trading symbols BRK.A and BRK.B.\nCautionary Statement\nCertain statements contained in this press release are “forward looking” statements within the meaning of the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guaranties of future performance and\nactual results may differ materially from those forecasted.\n— END —\nContact\nMarc D. Hamburg\n402-346-1400"

Questions can be submitted\nto Becky at berkshirequestions@cnbc.com. Becky has\nthe discretion to ask a follow-up if she feels we have not\nbeen sufficiently responsive to the question she has selected.\nWe will alternate between Becky and the audience and, all told, will\nlikely handle about 40-60 questions.\nIn the morning session, Vice Chairmen Ajit Jain and Greg Abel will\nbe available to answer questions from both the audience and\nBecky. Ajit handles insurance operations and Greg is in charge of all\nother operations. If questions are asked that are relevant to either\nof these areas, Becky or the on-premise questioner will get an\nanswer from Ajit or Greg. Only Greg and I will be available for\nquestions at the afternoon session.\nThe three of us will not get so much as a clue about the questions\nto be asked. We know you and Becky will pick some tough ones\nand that’s the way we like it.\nThere will be an 8:15am drawing at each of the 11 microphone\nlocations to select shareholders who wish to ask “audience”\nquestions.\n6\nMicrophone Manners\nWhen asking a question from a microphone zone, please:\n• State your name and hometown.\n• Ask your question promptly — speak loud & clear.\n• Do not ask more than one question or attempt to\n“bundle” several questions together.\n• Do not ask what we are buying or selling. Even if the\ninformation is public, we do not discuss how we arrive at\nour decisions. We also will not discuss politics. Any other\nsubjects are fair game.\nImportant Information\nMeeting Credentials\nYour Annual Meeting Credential is your “ticket” for enjoying the\nshareholder-only events and discounts over the weekend. Your\ncredential is mandatory for admission to the various venues. Please\nbe careful to remember your meeting credential when planning to\nparticipate in shareholder activities.\nBreakfast and Lunch Fare\nBreakfast pastries and coffee will be available at various locations\non the Concourse of the Arena as well as in the Exhibit Hall and\nConvention Center. Concession stands will be offering limited\nbreakfast items and lunch options for purchase starting at 9am.\nPre-Purchase Lunch Vouchers\nBoxed lunches from Jason’s Deli can be purchased on Saturday,\nMay 4.

This includes the use of cell phones for these purposes.\nThis policy will be rigorously enforced. Offenders are subject to\nequipment confiscation, meeting credential revocation, and\ndismissal from the meeting.\nSeat Saving\nWe have received complaints from some shareholders about\nexcessive seat saving in the Arena the morning of the meeting.\nReserving a few seats for your group is certainly acceptable, but\nblocking off entire rows is unfair to other shareholders. Security\nwill assist in enforcing this policy.\nLive Stream\nThe Berkshire Hathaway Q&A session will be broadcast on CNBC\nand webcast in English and Mandarin on CNBC.com beginning at\n8:30am CT.

To elect directors.\n2.–7. To act on six shareholder proposals if properly presented at the meeting.\n8. To consider and act upon any other matters that may properly come before the meeting or any adjournment thereof.\nThe Board of Directors has fixed the close of business on March 6, 2024 as the record date for determining the shareholders\nhaving the right to vote at the meeting or any adjournment thereof. A list of such shareholders will be available for examination by a\nshareholder for any purpose germane to the meeting during ordinary business hours at the offices of the Corporation at 3555 Farnam\nStreet, Omaha, Nebraska, during the ten days prior to the meeting.\nYour vote is important. Regardless of whether you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we hope you will vote as soon as possible.\nVoting will ensure you are represented at the Annual Meeting, regardless of whether you plan to attend the Annual Meeting. You may\ncast your vote over the Internet, by telephone, by mail or during the Annual Meeting.\nBy order of the Board of Directors\nMARC D. HAMBURG, Secretary\nOmaha, Nebraska\nMarch 15, 2024\nA shareholder may request credentials for admission to the meeting by completing and promptly returning to the\nCompany the meeting credential order form accompanying this notice. Otherwise, meeting credentials may be obtained\nat the meeting by persons identifying themselves as shareholders as of the record date. Possession of a proxy card, a\nvoting information form received from a bank or broker or a broker’s statement showing shares owned on March 6, 2024\nalong with proper identification will be required.\nIMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS FOR THE SHAREHOLDER\nMEETING TO BE HELD ON MAY 4, 2024.\nThe Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 4, 2024 and the 2023 Annual Report to\nthe Shareholders are available at www.berkshirehathaway.com/eproxy.\n\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\n3555 Farnam Street\nOmaha, Nebraska 68131\nPROXY STATEMENT\nFOR ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS\nMay 4, 2024\nThis statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors (“Board”) of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\n(hereinafter “Berkshire” or “Corporation” or “Company”) of proxies in the accompanying form for the Annual Meeting of\nShareholders to be held on Saturday, May 4, 2024 at 4:00 p.m. and at any adjournment thereof. This proxy statement and the enclosed\nform of proxy were first sent to shareholders on or about March 15, 2024. If the form of proxy enclosed herewith is executed and\nreturned as requested, it may nevertheless be revoked at any time prior to exercise by filing an instrument revoking it or a duly\nexecuted proxy bearing a later date. Solicitation of proxies will be made at the Corporation’s expense. The Corporation will reimburse\nbrokerage firms, banks, trustees and others for their actual out-of-pocket expenses in forwarding proxy material to the beneficial\nowners of its common stock.\nAs of the close of business on March 6, 2024, the record date for the Annual Meeting, the Corporation had outstanding and\nentitled to vote 563,678 shares of Class A Common Stock (hereinafter called “Class A Stock”) and 1,310,995,008 shares of Class B\nCommon Stock (hereinafter called “Class B Stock”). Each share of Class A Stock is entitled to one vote per share and each share of\nClass B Stock is entitled to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders of\nthe Corporation. The Class A Stock and Class B Stock vote together as a single class on the matters described in this proxy statement.\nOnly shareholders of record at the close of business on March 6, 2024 are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting or at any\nadjournment thereof.\nThe presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of Class A Stock and Class B Stock holding in the aggregate a\nmajority of the voting power of the Corporation’s stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. A\nplurality of the votes properly cast for the election of directors by the shareholders attending the meeting, in person or by proxy, will\nelect directors to office. However, pursuant to the Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Corporate Governance Guidelines, if a director nominee in\nan uncontested election receives a greater number of votes “withheld” from his or her election than votes “for” that director’s election,\nthe nominee shall promptly offer his or her resignation to the Board. A committee consisting of the Board’s independent directors\n(which will specifically exclude any director who is required to offer his or her own resignation) shall consider all relevant factors and\ndecide on behalf of the Board the action to be taken with respect to such offered resignation and will determine whether to accept the\nresignation or take other action. The Corporation will publicly disclose the Board’s decision with regard to any resignation offered\nunder these circumstances with an explanation of how the decision was reached, including, if applicable, the reasons for rejecting the\noffered resignation.\nA majority of votes properly cast upon any other question shall decide the question. Abstentions will count for purposes of\nestablishing a quorum, but will not count as votes cast for the election of directors or any other question. Accordingly, abstentions will\nhave no effect on the election of directors and are the equivalent of an “against” vote on matters requiring a majority of votes properly\ncast to decide the question. Broker non-votes will not count for purposes of establishing a quorum or as votes cast for the election of\ndirectors or any other question and accordingly will have no effect. Shareholders who submit proxies prior to the meeting but attend\nthe meeting in person may vote directly if they prefer and withdraw their proxies or may allow their proxies to be voted with the\nsimilar proxies submitted by other shareholders. Your vote is very important. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting,\nplease vote at your earliest convenience by following the instructions in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, voting\ninstruction form or the proxy card you received.\nIMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS FOR THE SHAREHOLDER\nMEETING TO BE HELD ON MAY 4, 2024.\nThe Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 4, 2024 and the 2023 Annual Report to the\nShareholders are available at www.berkshirehathaway.com/eproxy.\n1\n1. ELECTION OF DIRECTORS\nAt the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, a Board of Directors consisting of 14 members will be elected, each director to\nhold office until a successor is elected and qualified, or until the director resigns, is removed or becomes disqualified.\nThe Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee (“Governance Committee”) has established certain attributes that it\nseeks in identifying candidates for directors. In particular, the Governance Committee looks for individuals who have very high\nintegrity, business savvy, an owner-oriented attitude, a deep genuine interest in Berkshire and have had a significant investment in\nBerkshire shares relative to their resources for at least three years. These are the same attributes that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s\nChairman and CEO, believes to be essential if one is to be an effective member of the Board of Directors. In considering candidates\nfor director, the Governance Committee considers the entirety of each candidate’s credentials in the context of these attributes.

Burke; Kenneth I. Chenault;\nChristopher C. Davis; Susan L. Decker; Charlotte Guyman; Thomas S. Murphy, Jr.; Meryl B. Witmer; and Wallace R. Weitz.\nHoward G. Buffett and Susan A.

The Corporation and its subsidiaries paid fees of $12.5 million to Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP during 2023.\nBoard of Directors’ Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight\nWarren E. Buffett is Berkshire’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors. He is Berkshire’s largest\nshareholder and owns shares of Berkshire that represent approximately 31.0% of the voting interest and 15.0% of the economic\ninterest. As such he may be deemed to be Berkshire’s controlling shareholder. It is Mr. Buffett’s opinion that a controlling shareholder\nwho is active in the business, as is currently the case and has been the case for Mr. Buffett for over 50 years, should hold both roles.\nThis opinion is shared by Berkshire’s Board of Directors.\nMr. Buffett and the other members of the Board of Directors extensively discuss succession planning at each meeting of the\nBoard. Upon his death or inability to manage Berkshire, no member of the Buffett family will be involved in managing Berkshire but,\nas very substantial Berkshire shareholders, the Buffett family will assist the Board of Directors in picking and overseeing the CEO\nselected to succeed Mr. Buffett. At that time, Mr. Buffett believes it would be prudent to have a member of the Buffett family serve as\nthe non-executive Chairman of the Board. Ultimately, however, that decision will be the responsibility of the then Board of Directors.\n4\nSusan A. Decker is the Board’s lead independent director. Berkshire’s lead independent director does not represent the Board in\ncommunications with shareholders and other stakeholders. It is Berkshire’s policy to generally limit such communications to a nearly\nfive-hour question and answer (“Q&A”) session with Berkshire shareholders and stakeholders held each year prior to Berkshire’s\nannual shareholders meeting. At this session Berkshire’s shareholders and stakeholders have the opportunity to ask questions to\nBerkshire’s Chairman and its two Vice Chairmen (Warren Buffett, Greg Abel and Ajit Jain).\nEach Q&A session is held in Omaha, Nebraska and is televised and streamed by CNBC. Attendees in Omaha as well as\nshareholders and stakeholders not able to attend the Q&A session are able to ask questions. Questions from those not in attendance can be\nsent to an independent business reporter (currently Becky Quick of CNBC). Ms. Quick selects questions she believes will have the widest\ninterest. At the Q&A session questions are alternated between shareholders and stakeholders attending in person and Ms. Quick.\nBerkshire’s annual report, including Warren Buffett’s annual letter to shareholders, as well as its periodic reports filed with the\nSEC are posted to Berkshire’s web site at www.berkshirehathaway.com. Other than the annual Q&A session and the posting of\nBerkshire’s annual report and its periodic SEC filings on the internet, Berkshire’s Board does not routinely have communications\nselectively with shareholders or stakeholders.\nAs lead independent director, Ms. Decker along with the Board’s Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee\nprovide recommendations to Warren Buffett regarding potential director candidates. In addition, Ms. Decker provides suggestions to\nMr. Buffett and other members of the Board regarding the Board size and composition if Warren Buffett is no longer able to serve as\nBerkshire’s CEO and Chairman of the Board.\nThe full Board of Directors has responsibility for general oversight of risks. It receives reports from Mr. Buffett and other\nmembers of senior management at least twice a year on areas of risk facing the Corporation. In addition, as part of its charter, the\nAudit Committee discusses Berkshire’s policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management. Berkshire’s chief risk officer is\nits Chairman and CEO, Warren Buffett. Mr. Buffett and the members of the Audit Committee believe it is important that the full\nBoard have overall responsibility for risk oversight. Berkshire rarely utilizes outside advisors to anticipate future threats and trends.\nMr. Buffett along with Berkshire’s three Vice Chairmen are continually assessing risks.\nBoard of Directors’ Meetings\nBoard of Directors’ actions were taken in 2023 at the Annual Meeting of Directors that followed the 2023 Annual Meeting of\nShareholders and at two special meetings and upon one occasion by directors’ unanimous written consent. Each then current director\nattended all meetings of the Board and of the Committees of the Board on which he or she served. Directors are encouraged but not\nrequired to attend annual meetings of the Corporation’s shareholders.\nMeetings of Independent Directors\nThree meetings of independent directors were held during 2023. A shareholder or other interested party wishing to contact the\nnon-management directors or independent directors, as applicable, should send a letter to the Secretary of the Corporation at 3555\nFarnam Street, Omaha, NE 68131. The mailing envelope must contain a clear notation that the enclosed letter is to be forwarded to the\nCorporation’s non-management directors or independent directors, as applicable.\nBoard of Directors’ Committees\nThe Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)A of the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934. During 2023, the Audit Committee consisted of Susan L. Decker, Christopher C. Davis, Wallace R. Weitz and Meryl B.\nWitmer. The Board of Directors has determined that Ms. Decker is an “audit committee financial expert” as that term is used in\nItem 401(h) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act. All current members of the Audit Committee meet\nthe criteria for independence set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act and in Section 303A of the New York Stock\nExchange Listed Company Manual. The Audit Committee assists the Board with oversight of a) the integrity of the Corporation’s\nfinancial statements, b) the Corporation’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and c) the qualifications and\nindependence of the Corporation’s independent public accountants and internal audit function. The Audit Committee meets\nperiodically with the Corporation’s independent public accountants, Director of Internal Auditing and members of management and\nreviews the Corporation’s accounting policies and internal controls. The Audit Committee also selects the firm of independent public\naccountants to be retained by the Corporation to perform the audit. The Audit Committee held six meetings during 2023. The Board of\nDirectors adopted an Audit Committee Charter on April 29, 2000, which was subsequently amended and restated on March 2, 2004.\nThe amended Audit Committee Charter is available on Berkshire’s website at www.berkshirehathaway.com.\nThe Board of Directors has established a Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee (“Governance Committee”)\nand adopted a charter to define and outline the responsibilities of its members. A copy of the Governance Committee’s Charter is\navailable on Berkshire’s website at www.berkshirehathaway.com. During 2023, the Governance Committee consisted of Stephen B.\nBurke, Kenneth I. Chenault, Charlotte Guyman and Thomas S. Murphy, Jr., all of whom are independent directors in accordance with\nthe New York Stock Exchange director independence standards.\n5\nThe role of the Governance Committee is to assist the Board of Directors by a) recommending governance guidelines applicable\nto Berkshire; b) identifying, evaluating and recommending the nomination of Board members; c) setting the compensation of\nBerkshire’s Chief Executive Officer and performing other compensation oversight; and d) assisting the Board with other related tasks,\nas assigned from time to time. The Governance Committee met once during 2023.\nDirector Nominations\nBerkshire does not have a policy regarding the consideration of diversity in identifying nominees for director. In identifying\ndirector nominees, the Governance Committee does not seek diversity, however defined. Instead, as previously discussed, the\nGovernance Committee looks for individuals who have very high integrity, business savvy, an owner-oriented attitude, a deep genuine\ninterest in the Company and have had a significant investment in Berkshire shares relative to their resources for at least three years.\nWith respect to the selection of director nominees at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Governance Committee\nrecommends the Board nominate the 14 directors currently serving on the Board.\nBerkshire’s Governance Committee has a policy under which it will consider director recommendations presented by shareholders.\nA shareholder wishing to submit such a recommendation should send a letter to the Secretary of the Corporation at 3555 Farnam Street,\nOmaha, NE 68131. The mailing envelope must contain a clear notation that the enclosed letter is a “Director Nominee\nRecommendation.” The Secretary must receive the recommendation by December 15, 2024, for it to be considered by the Committee for\nthe 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The letter must identify the author as a shareholder and provide a brief summary of the\ncandidate’s qualifications. At a minimum, candidates recommended for nomination to the Board of Directors must meet the director\nindependence standards of the New York Stock Exchange. The Governance Committee’s policy provides that candidates recommended\nby shareholders will be evaluated using the same criteria as are applied to all other candidates. In particular, any recommended candidate\nshould own Berkshire stock that has represented a substantial portion of the candidate’s investment portfolio for at least three years.\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nThe Corporation has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for all Berkshire directors, officers and employees as well\nas directors, officers and employees of each of its subsidiaries. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on Berkshire’s\nwebsite at www.berkshirehathaway.com.\nRelated Persons Transactions\nThe Charter of the Audit Committee requires that the Audit Committee approve or ratify any Related Persons Transaction\n(“Transaction”) as defined in the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Audit Committee has established\nprocedures that require that all requests for approval of proposed Transactions or ratification of Transactions be referred to the\nChairperson of the Audit Committee or directly to the full committee. The full committee reviews any Transaction which the\nChairperson concludes is material to the Company or which the Chairperson is unable to review. Only Transactions which the Audit\nCommittee or its Chairperson finds to be in the best interests of Berkshire and its shareholders are approved or ratified. The\nChairperson reports all Transactions which she reviews to the Audit Committee annually for ratification.\nThe family members of Walter Scott, who was a Berkshire director until his death in September 2021, and related entities (the\n“Walter Scott Interests”) own approximately 8% of the voting stock of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”). The Walter\nScott Interests have an agreement with the Corporation that requires the Walter Scott Interests prior to selling any BHE shares to give\nthe Corporation the right to purchase the shares (if the Corporation is legally permitted to buy them) or to assign its right to purchase\nto a third party (if not legally permitted to buy them). That same agreement gives the Walter Scott Interests the right to put the shares\nto the Corporation (if the Corporation is legally permitted to buy them) at fair market value to be determined by independent appraisal\nif the sellers do not agree with the price offered by the Corporation, and payable in Berkshire shares.\nGovernance Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nThe Governance Committee of our Board of Directors currently consists of Charlotte Guyman, Stephen B. Burke, Kenneth I.\nChenault and Thomas S. Murphy, Jr. None of these individuals has at any time been an officer or employee of the Company. During\n2023, none of our executive officers served as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity for which\na member of our Board of Directors served as an executive officer.\nCorporate Governance Guidelines\nThe Board of Directors has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines to promote effective governance of the Corporation. The\nCorporate Governance Guidelines are available on Berkshire’s website at www.berkshirehathaway.com.\nDirector Compensation\nDirectors of the Corporation or its subsidiaries who are employees or spouses of employees do not receive fees for attendance at\ndirectors’ meetings. A director who is not an employee or a spouse of an employee receives a fee of $900 for each meeting attended in\nperson and $300 for participating in any meeting conducted by telephone. A director who serves as a member of the Audit Committee\nreceives a fee of $1,000 quarterly. Directors are reimbursed for their out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending meetings of\ndirectors or shareholders. The Company does not provide directors and officers liability insurance to its directors.\n6\nThe following table provides compensation information for the year ended December 31, 2023 for each non-management\nmember who was a member of the Corporation’s Board of Directors during 2023.\nFees Earned\nor Paid in Cash Total\nHoward G.

Based on our review and discussion with management, we recommend that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be\nincluded in the Company’s Proxy Statement.\nSubmitted by the members of the Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors.\nCharlotte Guyman, Chairperson Kenneth I. Chenault\nStephen B. Burke Thomas S. Murphy, Jr.\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nBerkshire’s program regarding compensation of its executive officers is different from most public company programs.\nMr. Buffett’s compensation is reviewed annually by the Governance Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors. Due to\nMr. Buffett’s desire that his compensation remain unchanged, the Committee has not proposed an increase in Mr. Buffett’s\ncompensation since the Committee was created in 2004. Prior to that time, Mr. Buffett recommended to the Board of Directors the\namount of his compensation. Mr. Buffett’s annual compensation has been $100,000 for more than 35 years and Mr. Buffett has\nadvised the Committee that he would not expect or desire such compensation to increase in the future.\nThe Committee has established a policy that neither the profitability of Berkshire nor the market value of its stock are to be\nconsidered in the compensation of any executive officer. Under the Committee’s compensation policy, Berkshire never intends to use\nBerkshire stock in compensating employees. The Committee has delegated to Mr. Buffett the responsibility for setting the\ncompensation of Mr. Abel, Vice Chairman-Non Insurance Operations, Mr. Jain, Vice Chairman-Insurance Operations and Marc\nHamburg, Berkshire’s Senior Vice President/Chief Financial Officer and Secretary.\nMr. Buffett will on occasion utilize Berkshire personnel and/or have Berkshire pay for minor items such as postage or phone\ncalls that are personal. Mr. Buffett reimburses Berkshire for these costs by making an annual payment to Berkshire in an amount that\nis equal to or greater than the costs that Berkshire has incurred on his behalf. During 2023, Mr. Buffett reimbursed Berkshire $50,000.\nBerkshire provides personal and home security services for Mr. Buffett. The cost for these services was $313,595 in 2023. Berkshire’s\nBoard of Directors believe that in light of Mr. Buffett’s critical role as Berkshire’s CEO and given that Mr. Buffett spends a\nsignificant amount of his time while at home on Berkshire business matters that such costs represent bona fide business expenses.\nNone of Berkshire’s named executive officers use Company cars or belong to clubs to which the Company pays dues. It should also\nbe noted that Mr. Buffett does not utilize corporate-owned aircraft for personal use. Mr. Buffett is personally a fractional NetJets\nowner, paying standard rates, and he uses Berkshire-owned aircraft for business purposes only.\nFactors considered by Mr. Buffett in setting the compensation for Mr. Abel, Mr. Jain and Mr. Hamburg are typically subjective,\nsuch as his perception of each of their performance and any changes in functional responsibility. Prior to the appointments of Mr. Abel\nand Mr. Jain as Berkshire Vice Chairmen in 2018, Mr. Buffett set the compensation for each of the CEOs of Berkshire’s significant\noperating businesses. However, since 2018, it has been the responsibility of Mr. Jain to set the compensation for the CEOs of Berkshire’s\ninsurance businesses and the responsibility of Mr. Abel to set the compensation for the CEOs of Berkshire’s other businesses. Mr. Jain\nand Mr. Abel use the same general criteria as had been used by Mr. Buffett. Many different incentive arrangements are utilized, with their\nterms dependent on such elements as the economic potential or capital intensity of the business. The incentives can be large and are\nalways tied to the operating results for which the CEO has authority and are related to measures over which the CEO has control.\n7\nThe following table discloses the compensation received for the three years ended December 31, 2023 by the Corporation’s Chief\nExecutive Officer, its other executive officers and its Chief Financial Officer.\nSUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE\nAnnual Compensation\nName and All Other Total\nPrincipal Position Year Salary Bonus Compensation Compensation\nWarren E.

Berkshire uses the S&P 500 Property & Casualty Index in preparing its performance graph as required by\nItem 201(e) of Regulation S-K. Accordingly, that index is utilized for purposes of preparing the Table.\n(4) Under existing Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, unrealized gains and losses on equity security investments are required to be included in earnings.\nAccordingly, due to the large size of Berkshire’s equity investment portfolio and the volatility in equity markets there can be significant volatility in Berkshire’s\nperiodic net earnings.\n(5) Berkshire does not use any financial performance measure in setting the compensation of its PEO or NEOs.\n8\nAs disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement, the annual base compensation of\nBerkshire’s PEO (Warren Buffett) has been $100,000 for over the last 35 years. The average Non-PEO compensation has increased\n6.3% during the four years ended December 31, 2023 with substantially all of that increase occurring in 2023 when the increase in\ncompensation as compared to 2022 was 5.4%. During the same four-year period, Berkshire’s total shareholder return was 59.8% or\n12.4% compounded annually.\nBerkshire does not believe that comparing compensation paid to its PEO and NEOs to Berkshire’s net earnings is meaningful due\nto the volatility in its net earnings caused by the GAAP requirement to include the annual changes in unrealized appreciation of\nBerkshire’s significant equity investment portfolio in its earnings. Berkshire’s management and its Board members believe that\nBerkshire’s operating earnings which is defined as Berkshire’s net earnings less its realized and unrealized investment gains/losses is\na more useful measurement. In that regard operating earnings were $21.9 billion in 2020; $27.6 billion in 2021; $30.8 billion in 2022;\nand $37.4 billion in 2023, which grew 70.8% over the past four years.\nAs described in Berkshire’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, it would be difficult to develop a peer group of companies\nsimilar to Berkshire. The Company owns subsidiaries in a number of diverse business activities of which the most important\ncomponent is the property and casualty insurance business. Accordingly, Berkshire used the Standard & Poor’s Property-Casualty\nInsurance Index as Berkshire’s peer group in the Table. As indicated in the Table, an investment of $100 in Berkshire at December 31,\n2019 would be worth $159.79 at December 31, 2023, whereas the same investment in the S&P Property-Casualty Insurance Index at\nDecember 31, 2019 would be worth $168.05 at December 31, 2023. It should also be noted that an investment of $100 in the S&P 500\nIndex at December 31, 2019 would be worth $157.48 at December 31, 2023.\nCEO Pay Ratio\nAs mandated by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and required under\nItem 402(u) of Regulation S-K (“Item 402(u)”), we are disclosing the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of\nBerkshire and its subsidiaries other than Berkshire’s CEO and the annual total compensation of Berkshire’s CEO, Warren E. Buffett.\nIn preparing this disclosure, Berkshire considered the fact that the Securities & Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued interpretive\nguidance to assist registrants in complying with the SEC’s Pay Ratio reporting requirements. Among other things, the SEC’s guidance\naddressed the use of reasonable estimates, assumptions and methodologies.\nBerkshire also considered that Mr. Buffett’s annual compensation has been $100,000 for more than the past 35 years and that\nMr. Buffett receives no bonus or any form of equity-based compensation. Additionally, Berkshire has over 60 separate operating\ngroups, many of whom have multiple separate operating groups. Accordingly, the identification of the median employee’s annual total\ncompensation of the 396,500 Berkshire subsidiary employees is a significant task.\nIn light of the fact that Mr. Buffett’s total compensation is far less than almost all public company CEOs, Berkshire believed that\nthe cost/benefit of complying precisely with the requirements of Item 402(u) would provide little, if any, useful information to its\nshareholders. Therefore, Berkshire used a judgmental sample representing approximately 2/3 of the total employees of Berkshire and\nits subsidiaries to determine the median employee’s compensation.\nThe median employee was determined as of December 31, 2023 using 2023 W-2 wages for all U.S. employees and equivalent\ntaxable compensation for all non-U.S. employees included in the sample. The median employee determination included all employees\nwithin the sample group who were employed at December 31, 2023. The annual total compensation for the median employee was\ncalculated using the same methodology for calculating the total compensation in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of\nRegulation S-K.\nBased on the information obtained as described in the preceding paragraphs, the ratio of Mr. Buffett’s annual total compensation\n($413,595) to the annual total compensation of the median employee in 2023 ($76,726) was 5.39 to 1.\n9\nIndependent Public Accountants\nDeloitte & Touche LLP (“Deloitte”) served as the Corporation’s principal independent public accountants for 2023.\nRepresentatives from that firm will be present at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, will be given the opportunity to make a\nstatement if they so desire and will be available to respond to any appropriate questions. The Corporation has not selected independent\npublic accountants for the current year, since its normal practice is for the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors to make such\nselection later in the year. The following table shows the fees paid or accrued for audit services and fees paid for audit-related, tax and\nall other services rendered by Deloitte for each of the last two years (in millions):\n2023 2022\nAudit Fees (a) $ 59.4 $ 52.1\nAudit-Related Fees (b) 0.9 0.9\nTax Fees (c) 1.0 0.5\nOther 3.6 0.6\n$ 64.9 $ 54.1\n(a) Audit fees include fees for the audit of the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements and interim reviews of the Corporation’s quarterly financial statements,\naudit services provided in connection with required statutory audits of many of the Corporation’s insurance subsidiaries and certain of its non-insurance\nsubsidiaries and comfort letters, consents and other services related to Securities and Exchange Commission matters.\n(b) Audit-related fees primarily include fees for certain audits of subsidiaries not required for purposes of Deloitte’s audit of the Corporation’s consolidated financial\nstatements or for any other statutory or regulatory requirements, audits of certain subsidiary employee benefit plans and consultations on various accounting and\nreporting matters.\n(c) Tax fees include fees for services relating to tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice. These services include assistance regarding federal, state and\ninternational tax compliance, tax return preparation and tax audits.\nThe Audit Committee has considered whether the non-audit services provided to the Company by Deloitte impaired the\nindependence of Deloitte and concluded that they did not.\nAll of the services performed by Deloitte were pre-approved in accordance with the pre-approval policy adopted by the Audit\nCommittee on May 5, 2003. The policy provides guidelines for audit, audit-related, tax and other non-audit services that may be\nprovided by Deloitte to the Company. The policy (a) identifies the guiding principles that must be considered by the Audit Committee\nin approving services to ensure that Deloitte’s independence is not impaired; (b) describes the audit, audit-related and tax services that\nmay be provided and the non-audit services that are prohibited; and (c) sets forth pre-approval requirements for all permitted services.\nReport of the Audit Committee\nFebruary 21, 2024\nTo the Board of Directors of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\nWe have reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation and its subsidiaries to be set forth in\nItem 8 of the Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 with management of the Corporation\nand Deloitte & Touche LLP, independent public accountants for the Corporation.\nWe have also discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP the matters required by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(“PCAOB”) to be discussed, as adopted in Auditing Standard No. 1301 (Communications with Audit Committees). We have received\nthe written disclosures and the letter from Deloitte & Touche LLP required by the applicable PCAOB requirements for independent\naccountant communications with audit committees with respect to auditor independence and have discussed with Deloitte & Touche\nLLP its independence from the Corporation.\nIt is not the duty of the Audit Committee to plan or conduct audits or to determine that the Corporation’s financial statements are\ncomplete and accurate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; that is the responsibility of management and\nthe Corporation’s independent public accountants. In giving its recommendation to the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee has\nrelied on (i) management’s representation that such financial statements have been prepared with integrity and objectivity and in\nconformity with generally accepted accounting principles and (ii) the reports of the Corporation’s independent public accountants\nwith respect to such financial statements.\nBased on the review and discussions with management of the Corporation and Deloitte & Touche LLP referred to above, we\nrecommend to the Board of Directors that the Corporation publish the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation and\nsubsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2023 in the Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSubmitted by the members of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nSusan L.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL\nAs You Sow on behalf of Elizabeth Kantor Trust U/A DTD 3/11/1993, owner of shares of Berkshire Common Stock with a value\nin excess of $2,000 for at least three years intends to present for action at the meeting the following proposal.\nWHEREAS: With the increased severity and frequency of climate-related, extreme weather impacts, financial risk to the insurance industry\nis increasing year over year. The frequency of natural catastrophes between 2010 and 2022 increased 28% over the prior decade,1 and\ncatastrophe losses in the first half of 2023 were the highest in over two decades.2 Swiss Re reports that with no mitigating actions against\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions increase, there will likely be a global average drop in GDP output of 18% by 2050.3\nIn 2022, Berkshire Hathaway’s insurance underwriting generated a loss of $90 million compared to earnings of $657 and $728 million\nin 2020 and 2021.4\nBerkshire is amplifying risk by continuing to invest in and underwrite high GHG-emitting activities. Berkshire owned approximately\n12% of all oil and gas assets held by insurance companies in 2019 ($20.6 billion)5 and holds the second largest insurance industry\nstake in coal, at 7.84%.6 In contrast, 41 peer insurers, representing nearly 40% of the market for primary insurance, have withdrawn or\nreduced coal coverage, a number that doubled in the last two years.7\n1 https://www.verzekeraars.nl/media/11456/gfia-report-global-protection-gaps-and-recommendations-for-bridging-them.pdf, p.20\n2 https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230803387647/en/Inflation-High-CAT-Losses-to-Lead-to-2023-Underwriting-Loss-\nfor-PC-Industry-But-Recession-Likely-Avoided-This-Year-New-Triple-IMilliman-Report-Shows\n3 https://www.swissre.com/media/press-release/nr-20210422-economics-of-climate-change-risks.html\n4 https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2022ar/2022ar.pdf, p.K-33\n5 https://www.ceres.org/sites/default/files/reports/2023-\n08/Changing%20Climate%20for%20the%20Insurance%20Sector_%20Research%20and%20Insights.pdf, p.27\n6 https://www.ceres.org/sites/default/files/reports/2023-\n08/Changing%20Climate%20for%20the%20Insurance%20Sector_%20Research%20and%20Insights.pdf, p.26\n7 https://insure-our-future.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/SP-IOF-2022-Scorecard-v0.8-online-3.pdf, p.7\n12\nIn 2022, a global GHG accounting and reporting standard for insurance emissions launched, providing a standardized methodology to\nmeasure and disclose GHG emissions for insurance and underwriting portfolios.8 Both the Net Zero Insurance Alliance and the Net\nZero Asset Owners Alliance highlight the importance of setting Net Zero by 2050 and interim goals for financed and insured\nemissions to meet the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C goal.\nBerkshire does not disclose or set targets for its invested or insured GHG emissions, despite growing climate-related financial risk.\nBerkshire is falling behind peers. Both Travelers9 and AIG10 have begun disclosing financed emissions; AIG11 and the Hartford12 have\nset net zero goals for their insured and financed emissions, as have several European re-insurers including Swiss Re.13 Berkshire\nrecently earned a near-zero score on decarbonization metrics in the Climate Action 100+ 2023 Net Zero Company Benchmark.14\nBE IT RESOLVED: Shareholders request that Berkshire issue a report, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information,\ndisclosing how it intends to measure, disclose, and reduce the GHG emissions associated with its underwriting, insuring, and\ninvestment activities in alignment with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C goal.\nSUPPORTING STATEMENT: Shareholders recommend at board discretion, that Berkshire’s report include a timeline for when it\nwill begin measuring and disclosing emissions and when it will set and publish a Paris-aligned 2050 emissions reduction goal, with\ninterim targets.\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY FAVORS A VOTE AGAINST THE PROPOSAL FOR THE FOLLOWING\nREASONS:\nBerkshire’s Board recommends a “no” vote on this proposal. The Board does not believe issuing a report disclosing how\nBerkshire intends to measure, disclose and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with its underwriting, insuring and\ninvestment activities is necessary.\nThe primary business of Berkshire’s insurance operations is to monitor, assess and price risk at an expected economic profit to address\nthe risk-transfer needs of its insurance customers. If there were no risks, or all risks were assumed by governments, there would be no\ninsurance business. Berkshire has no idea what loss costs will be for autos 10, 20 or 30 years from now. That’s why it generally sells only\nsix-month policies. This same caution in respect to future loss costs applies to all property/casualty coverages. To date, Berkshire has been\nquite successful in matching prices to risk, and 2023 was a particularly good year.\nThe insurance risks associated with climate change are assessed within the enterprise risk management framework, along with\nthe adoption of climate-specific risk management procedures. These procedures include stress testing and review of post-stress\nmetrics as well as consideration of the frequency and severity of weather events and regulatory adjustments that may impact\nunderwriting decisions or adversely impact future operating results.\nBerkshire’s Board periodically receives reports on the major risks and opportunities of Berkshire’s operating businesses. The\ninsurance operations’ continual assessment of the risk of natural disasters, strong underwriting controls to limit exposure and stress\ntesting lead the Board to conclude that climate-related risks within the insurance group are appropriately monitored and managed\nwithin the Board’s risk appetite. Accordingly, the Board recommends that our shareholders vote against this proposal.\nProxies given without instruction will be voted AGAINST this shareholder proposal.\n3. SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL\nMichael W. Frerichs as Treasurer for the State of Illinois and Trustee of the Bright Start College Savings Trust, owner of shares\nof Berkshire Common Stock with a value of at least $2,000 for the last three years intends to present for action at the meeting the\nfollowing proposal.\nResolved: Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (the “Company”) request that its Board of Directors (the “Board”) disclose, in a\nconsolidated annual report (at reasonable expense and omitting proprietary information) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data by\nscope, as well as progress towards its net-zero decarbonization goal, for Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”).\n8 https://carbonaccountingfinancials.com/en/newsitem/pcaf-launches-the-global-ghg-accounting-and-reporting-standard-for-\ninsurance-associated-emissions\n9 https://sustainability.travelers.com/iw-documents/sustainability/Travelers_TCFDReport2022.pdf, p.34; https://www.aig.com/\ncontent/dam/aig/america-canada/us/documents/about-us/report/aig-esg-report_2022.pdf, p.32\n10 https://www.aig.com/content/dam/aig/america-canada/us/documents/about-us/report/aig-esg-report_2022.pdf, p.32\n11 https://www.aig.com/content/dam/aig/america-canada/us/documents/about-us/report/aig-esg-report_2021.pdf.coredownload.pdf,\np.38\n12 https://s0.hfdstatic.com/sites/the_hartford/files/sustainability-highlight-report.pdf, p.14\n13 https://www.swissre.com/dam/jcr:5863fbc4-b708-4e61-acc7-6ef685461abb/esg-risk-framework.pdf, p.13\n14 https://www.climateaction100.org/company/berkshire-hathaway/\n13\nSupporting statement: Given that BHE is one of the Company’s largest emitters, and that it is among the top 10 largest owners of\nUS coal power capacity in the country15, we are calling on BHE to enhance its sustainability reporting practices. While we recognize\nthat BHE has taken steps to disclose emissions and decarbonization data,16 the disclosure is insufficient for investors to understand the\ncompany’s emissions profile in aggregate and progress towards achieving its net-zero goal. Most importantly, BHE does not follow\nglobally recognized best practices for disclosure of emissions data by breaking it down by scope17; rather, it presents emissions data\nby the Company’s operating segments (i.e., owned generation and purchased power).\nWe encourage BHE to follow best practices when it comes to reporting its emissions. The Task Force on Climate-related Financial\nDisclosures (TCFD), which is currently supported by over 4,850 organizations worldwide and fully incorporated into the International\nSustainability Standards Board (ISSB) disclosure standards18, includes reporting emission data by scope in its list of recommended\ndisclosures19. BHE is currently falling behind its competitors when it comes to emissions disclosures. For example, both Pacific Gas20\nand Edison International21 disclose their emission data as recommended by the TCFD, including the breakdown of emissions by scope.\nIn addition to more streamlined disclosure of emissions data, we recommend BHE disclose data on the progress of its net-zero and\ndecarbonization goals. We applaud BHE for establishing long-term and intermediary net-zero targets, as well as plans to retire its coal\nplants and natural gas units22. However, in order to facilitate a clearer analysis of the initiatives in place and credibility of the Company’s\nlong-term goals, BHE should present these initiatives alongside emissions data by scope. Other US-based energy companies consolidate\nthis information in a single report, such as Sempra Energy23, PPL Corporation24, Duke Energy25, and ConocoPhillips26.\nFurthermore, domestic regulation at both the state27 and federal28 level is likely to require that the Company disclose emission data by\nscope. Therefore, in addition to providing more decision-useful information for investors, standardized reporting would prepare the\nCompany for compliance requirements.\nTherefore, we recommend that BHE disclose:\n1. Scope 1 and 2 emissions data for all of its operating companies.\n2. Steps to be taken in its decarbonization strategy to reach intermediate and long-term goals.\n3. Progress BHE has made on reaching its intermediary and long-term goals.\nWe urge shareholders to vote FOR this proposal.\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY FAVORS A VOTE AGAINST THE PROPOSAL FOR THE FOLLOWING\nREASONS:\nBerkshire’s Board does not believe that additional reporting of Berkshire Hathaway Energy’s greenhouse gas emissions by scope\nand progress toward its net zero decarbonization goal is necessary at this time.\nSince 2017, Berkshire Hathaway Energy has voluntarily and publicly reported its greenhouse gas emissions data from its U.S.-\nbased operating companies utilizing the template developed collaboratively by industry, Wall Street investors and other organizations\n(see: https://www.brkenergy.com/esg-sustainability/governance). The data reported includes emissions reduction progress to date,\ncompared to Berkshire Hathaway Energy’s 2005 baseline. Berkshire Hathaway Energy also reports to investors and makes publicly\navailable its progress in transitioning its generating fleet and investment plans in annual presentations to fixed-income investors and at\nthe Edison Electric Institute’s Financial Conference (see: https://www.brkenergy.com/investors/financial-filings).\n15 https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/top-owners-of-us-coal-gas-capacity-ramp-up-\non-renewables-61601422\n16 https://www.brkenergy.com/esg-sustainability/governance\n17 https://ghgprotocol.org/standards\n18 https://www.ifrs.org/news-and-events/news/2023/07/foundation-welcomes-tcfd-responsibilities-from-2024/\n19 https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2023/09/2023-Status-Report.pdf\n20 https://www.pge.com/content/dam/pge/docs/about/pge-systems/PGE-Climate-Strategy-\nReport.pdf?_gl=1*1tqme4m*_gcl_au*NDUzNzcyNDQ2LjE20TgwOTE2MDM.*_ga*MTQxMjkONTIONS4xNjk4MDkxNjAy*_ga_\nFQYX57XZEJ*MTcwMDA5MTgxNC4zLjEuMTcwMDA5MjlwOC4zNi4wLjA\n21 https://download.edison.com/406/files/20237/eix-2022-sustainability-\nreport.pdf?Signature=xbowGI10g2Wi57bOuZORCs3kYqs%3D&Expires=1699100336&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJX7XEOOELCY\nGIVDQ&versionId=ExvCtypZUkNJb6hBZAIxOfV9zbbUdnrf&response-content-disposition=attachment\n22 https://berkshirehathaway.com/bhenergy/BHE2022InvestPresent.pdf\n23 https://csr.sempra.com/wp-content/uploads/sempra_csr_2022_rgb.pdf\n24 https://www.pplweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/PPL-Corporation_2022-Sustainability-Report_FINAL.pdf\n25 https://s201.q4cdn.com/583395453/files/doc_downloads/esg-key-documents/2023/climate-report-2022.pdf\n26 https://static.conocophillips.com/files/resources/conocophillips-2022-sustainability-report.pdf\n27 https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=20232024OSB253\n28 https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-46\n14\nUntil such time as emission reporting requirements are mandatory and relevant guidance is issued by the reporting authorities,\nthe Board does not believe it is prudent to revise Berkshire Hathaway Energy’s emissions reporting methodology. Accordingly, the\nBoard recommends that our shareholders vote against this proposal.\nProxies given without instruction will be voted AGAINST this shareholder proposal.\n4. SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL\nMeredith Benton of Whistle Stop Capital on behalf of Myra K. Young owner of Berkshire Common Stock with a value in excess\nof $2,000 for at least three years intends to present for action at the meeting the following proposal.\nRESOLVED: Shareholders request that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire”) report to shareholders on the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. The report should be done at reasonable expense, exclude proprietary information,\nand provide transparency on outcomes, using quantitative metrics for workforce diversity, hiring, promotion, and retention of\nemployees, including data by gender, race, and ethnicity.\nSUPPORTING STATEMENT: Quantitative data is sought so that investors can assess and compare the effectiveness of companies’\ndiversity, equity, and inclusion programs.\nIt is advised that this content be provided through Berkshire’s existing sustainability reporting infrastructure. An independent report\nspecific to this topic is not requested.\nWHEREAS: Companies that release, or have committed to release, more inclusion data than Berkshire include: American\nInternational Group, American Express, PayPal, Visa, Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, Blackrock, and Mastercard.\nAs You Sow and Whistle Stop Capital released research in November 202329 that reviewed over 4,500 EEO-1 reports, which show\ncorporate workforce diversity. The data shows a positive correlation between manager diversity and corporate performance.\nAs of the date of the filing of this proposal, Berkshire had not yet shared sufficient hiring, retention, or promotion data to allow\ninvestors to determine the effectiveness of its diversity and inclusion programs.\nAs detailed below, inclusion indicators are also important in assessing Berkshire’s workplace equity efforts and if the Company will\nbe able to successfully build, utilize, and retain a diverse management team.\nHiring: Studies conducted by economists at the University of Chicago and UC Berkeley found that “discriminating companies tend to\nbe less profitable,” stating “it is costly for firms to discriminate against productive workers.”30\nPromotion: Without equitable promotional practices, companies will be unable to build the necessary employee pipelines for diverse\nmanagement. Women and employees of color experience “a broken rung” in their careers; for every 100 men who are promoted, only\n87 women are. Whereas women of color comprise 18 percent of the entry-level workforce and only 6 percent of executives.31\nRetention: Retention rates indicate if employees believe a company represents their best opportunity. Morgan Stanley has found that\nemployee retention above industry average can indicate a competitive advantage and higher levels of future profitability.32\nWarren Buffett has acknowledged that inequities exist in the workplace between women, people of color, and their White male\ncounterparts. Berkshire has improved its diversity data disclosure by releasing its consolidated EEO-1 form, which shows workforce\ncomposition by gender, race, and ethnicity.\nIn 2021, 2022, and 2023, more than 40 percent of Berkshire’s independent investors voted in support of this data disclosure request.33\nHowever, in a review of each Berkshire company, the release of this data had not improved over the last three years. Investors remain\nwithout key information on the hiring, promotion, and retention rates of Berkshire employees.\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY FAVORS A VOTE AGAINST THE PROPOSAL FOR THE FOLLOWING\nREASONS:\nBerkshire’s Board recommends a “no” vote on this proposal. Berkshire’s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion and the\neffectiveness of our companies’ related programs starts with our leaders, including our Board of Directors, of which four members are\nfemale and two members are racially or ethnically diverse. However, it should be noted that these directors were not selected for\ndiversity purposes.\n29 https://www.asyousow.org/report-page/2023-positive-relationships-linking-workforce-diversity-and-financial-performance\n30 https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/business/economy/hiring-racial-discrimination.html\n31 https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/women-in-the-workplace\n32 https://www.morganstanley.com/im/publication/insights/articles/article_culturequantframework_us.pdf, p. 2\n33 https://www.asyousow.org/resolutions-tracker\n15\nTo ensure long-term success for our shareholders, Berkshire encourages its leaders to execute diversity, equity and inclusion\nstrategies that are tailored to the unique aspects of their business. Berkshire has made publicly available its U.S. workforce data for all\nsubsidiaries compiled in the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s 2022 Employer Information Report (EEO-1), along\nwith a summary of the data by business segment on its website at:\nhttps://www.berkshirehathaway.com/sustainability/berkshire2022eeo1.pdf.\nBerkshire’s operating companies continue to show their commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion through a number of\nactions, including, at certain companies, the creation of senior level positions and/or employee-driven groups to support these efforts\nat their respective organizations. These actions ensure the culture and practices of our companies reflect a workplace that welcomes\nand values all. These efforts have been recognized by external organizations such as the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s\nCorporate Equality Index which recognized BNSF for the second year in its 2023-2024 “Equality 100 Award” as a Leader in\nLGBTQ+ Workplace Inclusion (see: https://www.hrc.org/resources/cei-equality-100-award) and Berkshire Hathaway Energy’s\ncommitment to creating sustainable and meaningful benefits for the military community, recognized as a Gold Military Friendly\nEmployer (see: https://www.militaryfriendly.com/employers).\nBerkshire manages its operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis and has minimal involvement in these\nbusinesses’ day-to-day activities. Accordingly, Berkshire’s Board recommends that our shareholders vote against this proposal,\nsupporting the long-standing business model that each business is individually responsible for developing and implementing policies,\nprograms and results, including those related to diversity, equity and inclusion.\nProxies given without instruction will be voted AGAINST this shareholder proposal.\n5. SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL\nSegal Marco Advisors on behalf of the AFL-CIO Equity Index Funds, owner of Berkshire Common Stock with a value of at least\n$25,000 for at least one year intends to present for action at the meeting the following proposal.\nRESOLVED, that shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (the “Company”) urge the Board of Directors (the “Board”) to take the\nsteps necessary to form a Railroad Safety Committee of independent directors with the power and duty to review staffing levels and\ntheir impact on safety at our Company’s railroad subsidiary Burlington Northern Santa Fe (“BNSF”), and to meet and confer on safety\nissues with relevant stakeholders such as customers, communities, employees, and labor unions.\nSUPPORTING STATEMENT\nEnsuring the safety of our Company’s railroad operations is not only a collective legal and ethical responsibility, but also a vital\ncomponent of maintaining the financial health and reputation of our Company. Recent derailments in the railroad industry, including\nthose involving BNSF, have drawn attention to the potential risks associated with these operations, necessitating a proactive approach\nto enhance safety measures.34 There are over 1,000 known train derailments a year in the United States — averaging three a day.35\nAs common carriers, railroads are required by federal law to transport hazardous materials that can result in the loss of life and\nenvironmental contamination in the event of a train derailment. In 2023, the Norfolk Southern (“NS”) train derailment in East\nPalestine, Ohio resulted in the release of vinyl chloride that captured national media attention and publicized the need for improved\nrailroad safety.36 The 2023 East Palestine derailment has cost NS almost $1 billion and a similar derailment on BNSF could pose a\nsignificant financial risk to BNSF.37\n38 (PICTURE)\n39 (PICTURE)\nThe East Palestine train derailment has also increased scrutiny of the role of the Precision-Scheduled Railroading (“PSR”) operating\nmodel used by BNSF and other Class I freight railroads to increase operating efficiency and reduce costs.40 In our view, PSR has\nresulted in greatly reduced staffing levels, less equipment, and longer trains, all of which have contributed to the safety issues. In\n2022, Surface Transportation Board Chairman Martin Oberman stated that:\n34 https://www.propublica.org/article/railroad-safety-union-pacific-csx-bnsf-trains-freight;\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2023/07/28/ntsb-report-2021-amtrak-derailment/;\nhttps://apnews.com/article/minnesota-ethanol-train-derailment-raymond-bnsf-74ddb9ab067d44b01c373ca75567282d\n35 https://www.npr.org/2023/03/09/1161921856/there-are-about-3-u-s-train-derailments-per-day-they-arent-usually-major-disaste\n36 https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/15/us/ohio-train-derailment-anxiety.html; https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/17/opinion/ohio-\ntrain-derailment-safety-regulation.html\n37 https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/27/investing/norfolk-southern-east-palestine-derailment-costs/index.html\n38 https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/NR20230214.aspx\n39 https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/NR20230302A.aspx\n40 https://www.wsj.com/articles/norfolk-southern-derailment-spurs-questioning-of-turnaround-kings-strategy-5403464c\n16\n“Over the last 6 years, the Class Is collectively have reduced their work force by 29% – that is about 45,000 employees\ncut from the payrolls. In my view, all of this has directly contributed to where we are today – rail users experiencing\nserious deteriorations in rail service because, on too many parts of their networks, the railroads simply do not have a\nsufficient number of employees.”41\nWhile PSR may reduce staffing costs in the short-run, we believe that the long-term cost of increased derailments will outweigh any\nshort-term financial gain. By establishing a Railroad Safety Committee, our Company can reduce the likelihood of derailments,\nprotect its workforce, safeguard communities along its routes, provide better service to customers, demonstrate its commitment to\nethical business practices, and enhance our Company’s long-term value.\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY FAVORS A VOTE AGAINST THE PROPOSAL FOR THE FOLLOWING\nREASONS:\nBerkshire’s Board recommends a “no” vote on this proposal. The Board does not believe that creating a Railroad Safety\nCommittee of independent directors is necessary or appropriate.\nThe Board periodically receives reports on the major risks and opportunities of Berkshire’s operating businesses and Berkshire\nmanages its operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis and has minimal involvement in these businesses’ day-to-day\nactivities. The creation of a Board committee focused on railroad safety would be inconsistent with Berkshire’s culture and is\nunnecessary.\nBerkshire’s railroad business conducted through Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) is focused on safety. Operating\nfree of accidents and injuries has long been part of BNSF’s vision and the company has broad-based, multi-level risk-reduction\nprograms to reduce incident risk and achieve that vision. Many of these risk identification and mitigation programs have been\ndeveloped in partnership with employees and their labor unions. BNSF is also subject to the federal safety regulations promulgated by\nthe Federal Railroad Administration. BNSF’s safety culture and management oversight has resulted in industry-leading safety results,\nincluding a 70% reduction in employee injuries between 2000 and 2023.\nBNSF implements state-of-the-art safety programs to responsibly transport hazardous materials with safer tank cars and partners\nwith local emergency responders to avoid injury and environmental damage. BNSF has a certified Incident Management Team trained\nto coordinate response efforts with local, state and federal response agencies in compliance with the National Incident Management\nSystems and has more than 90 trained hazardous materials responders and 40 advisors at 50 locations. BNSF was the first railroad to\ndeploy a fleet of fire-fighting foam trailers pre-positioned across the rail network along with other specialized response equipment.\nBNSF also offers a real-time Geographic Information System tracking application to local emergency response agencies, enabling\nlocal emergency personnel to quickly identify the contents and relative location of any BNSF train.\nThe shareholder proposal inaccurately states that BNSF has implemented a Precision-Scheduled Railroading (PSR) operating\nmodel. BNSF is the only U.S. and Canadian Class I railroad that has not implemented PSR and the appropriate number of employees\nis determined by BNSF.\nWith BNSF’s track record and continued focus on enhancing the safety and efficiency of rail operations, the Board believes that\nBNSF management is best positioned to assess and monitor the impact of staffing levels on operational safety. Accordingly, the Board\nbelieves there is no need for a Railroad Safety Committee at the parent company level. The Board recommends that our shareholders\nvote against this proposal.\nProxies given without instruction will be voted AGAINST this shareholder proposal.\n6. SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL\nScott Shepard, Director of the Free Enterprise Project of the National Center for Public Policy Research, owner of Berkshire\nCommon Stock with a value in excess of $2,000 for at least three years intends to present for action at the meeting the following\nproposal.\nWHEREAS: Many policymakers, investors and companies have converged on goals including the need to limit global temperature\nincrease to 1.5° C and to reach net zero global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050.\nThe International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Net Zero 2050 Roadmap (NZE) describes an energy sector path for net zero GHG\nemissions. The IEA claims no investment in new fossil supply projects is needed in a net zero scenario (NZE): “As a share of total\nenergy supply, [fossil fuels] fall from 80% in 2020 to just over 20% in 2050.”42\n41 https://www.stb.gov/news-communications/latest-news/pr-22-21/\n42 https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/deebef5d-0c34-4539-9d0c-10b13d840027/NetZeroby2050-\nARoadmapfortheGlobalEnergySector_CORR.pdf\n17\nIn line with such assumptions, Berkshire Hathaway Energy (BHE), which is 92% owned by Berkshire Hathaway, has invested\n$37 billion in renewable energy generation and expects to complete its transition to net zero emissions by 2050.43 According to\nreports, “BHE is moving rapidly to shift its power mix to wind and solar….Berkshire will soon get 45% of its power from wind, solar,\ngeothermal energy and hydropower….”44 In fact, “More than 40% of BHE’s owned generation capacity in 2022 came from wind and\nsolar alone.”45 It has closed 16 coal-fired plants in recent years and has announced closing plans for 16 additional plants.46\nThese investment decisions presume the IEA NZE assumptions are true, but it is unclear what, if any, analysis Berkshire Hathaway\nhas done to protect company assets should NZE prove false.\nA 2023 study by the Energy Policy Research Foundation (EPRF) found that net zero advocates have misconstrued the IEA’s position\non new oil and gas investment, and that the IEA has made questionable assumptions and milestones for NZE about government\npolicies, energy and carbon prices, behavioral changes, economic growth, and technology maturity.47\nThe EPRF study found, “Oil and gas play irreplaceable roles in modern civilization that are not reproducible with low-carbon\nalternatives. The attempt to substitute them with inferior, less efficient, energy sources will have enormous micro- and\nmacroeconomic consequences and profound geopolitical implications.”48\nNZE advocates speak in terms of fossil fuels as stranded assets, but no consideration has been given as to whether the true stranded\nassets might be the assets spent on expensive renewable energy options based on faulty assumptions. Should the EPRF’s study ring\ntrue, our Company stands to lose tens of billions of dollars in renewable energy investments, plus the costs of reverting back to\nreliable energy sources. Additionally, it appears that most countries are not really going to outlaw reliable and affordable energy,\nfurther making current net-zero stranded-asset theory non-sensical.49\nRESOLVED: Shareholders request that Berkshire Hathaway’s Board seek an audited report assessing how applying the findings of\nthe Energy Policy Research Foundation would affect the assumptions, costs, estimates, and valuations underlying its financial\nstatements, including those related to long-term commodity and carbon prices, remaining asset lives, future asset retirement\nobligations, capital expenditures and impairments. The Board should obtain and ensure publication of the report by February 2025, at\nreasonable cost and omitting proprietary information.\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY FAVORS A VOTE AGAINST THE PROPOSAL FOR THE FOLLOWING\nREASONS:\nBerkshire’s Board recommends a “no” vote on this proposal. The Board does not believe the issuance of an audited report\nassessing how applying the findings of the Energy Policy Research Foundation would provide useful information for shareholders.\nUnder Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the energy business operates a portfolio of locally managed businesses that share a vision of\nbeing the best energy company in serving its customers, while delivering sustainable energy solutions, delivering low-cost, safe and\nreliable service each day to more than 12 million electric and natural gas customers and end-users throughout the U.S., Great Britain\nand Alberta, Canada. The operating companies manage risk through a balanced and diverse energy portfolio and are subject to\nregulation by local utility authorities that examine rates and resources. The diverse generating portfolio operated by Berkshire\nHathaway Energy’s businesses, including renewable generation, creates a competitive advantage and results in retail rates for\ncustomers of those companies to be 6% to 39% below the national average of regulated U.S. electric utilities.

Accordingly, Berkshire’s Board recommends that our shareholders vote against\nthis proposal.\nProxies given without instruction will be voted AGAINST this shareholder proposal.\n7. SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL\nPaul Chesser on behalf of National Legal and Policy Center, owner of shares of Berkshire Common Stock with a value in excess\nof $2,000 for at least three years intends to present for action at the meeting the following proposal.\nRESOLVED:\nShareholders request that, beginning in 2024, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Company”) report annually to shareholders on the nature and\nextent to which corporate operations depend on, and are vulnerable to, Communist China, which is a serial human rights violator, a\ngeopolitical threat, and an adversary to the United States. The report should exclude confidential business information but provide\nshareholders with a sense of the Company’s reliance on activities conducted within, and under control of, the Communist Chinese\ngovernment.\nSupporting Statement:\nAmerican companies doing business in China is a controversial public policy issue. CNN reported in 2021, “Doing business in China\nis difficult. A clash over human rights is making it harder.”50\nThe Company does business in – and relies on materials, parts, labor, services, and investments – in entities in China.\nChina is a serial violator of human rights.\nChina is also hostile to the U.S. for a variety of reasons, including:\n— China intends to displace the U.S. as the lone global superpower by 2049;\n— The U.S. has committed to defend Taiwan, which China has asserted is part of its country and may attempt to seize by force;\n— U.S.-China relations are tense over a number of issues including China’s military expansion; egregious human rights violations;\nactions related to the COVID pandemic; intellectual property theft; relentless espionage; elimination of freedom in Hong Kong; and\nenvironmental pollution.\nThe communist government, and by extension many companies based within its borders, were also identified in the U.S. State\nDepartment’s 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report as a state sponsor of human trafficking. The Company is subject to the Uyghur\nForced Labor Prevention Act, which imposes strict verification of parts and products imported from China, that they are not generated\nfrom slave labor.\nYet the Company does not seem to take the China threat seriously. At the 2023 annual meeting, its vice chairman called tensions\nbetween the U.S. and China “stupid, stupid, stupid,” and added, “one thing we should do is get along with China, and have lots of free\ntrade with China…it’s in our mutual interest.”51 The Company’s most recent 10-K annual report fails to specifically address\ngeopolitical risk, in China or elsewhere, for its many subsidiaries or portfolio companies.52\nA July 2022 joint statement from the leaders of the British and American domestic intelligence agencies warned that the Communist\nChinese Party is the greatest threat to the international order. “We consistently see that it’s the Chinese government that poses the\nbiggest long-term threat to our economic and national security, and by ‘our,’ I mean both of our nations, along with our allies in\nEurope and elsewhere,” said Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Christopher Wray.53\nGiven the controversial, if not dangerous, nature of doing business in and with China, shareholders have the right to know the extent\nto which the Company’s business operations and holdings depend on Communist China.\n50 https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/02/business/nike-china-western-business-intl-hnk/index.html\n51 https://www.axios.com/2023/05/06/berkshire-hathaway-annual-meeting-china\n52 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067983/000095017023004451/brka-20221231.htm\n53 https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/the-threat-posed-by-the-chinese-government-and-the-chinese-communist-party-to-the-\neconomic-and-national-security-of-the-united-states\n19\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY FAVORS A VOTE AGAINST THE PROPOSAL FOR THE FOLLOWING\nREASONS:\nBerkshire’s Board recommends a “no” vote on this proposal. The Board does not believe issuing a report on the nature and extent\nto which corporate operations depend on, and are vulnerable to, the Peoples Republic of China (“China”) is necessary. Berkshire\ndiscloses material risks to its businesses in its filings with the SEC. In addition, Berkshire’s Prohibited Business Practices Policy\nspecifically addresses transactions with China and human rights issues. All requirements of this policy are applicable to each\nBerkshire subsidiary. Accordingly, Berkshire’s Board recommends that our shareholders vote against the proposal.\nProxies given without instruction will be voted AGAINST this shareholder proposal.\n8. OTHER MATTERS\nAs of the date of this statement your management knows of no business to be presented to the meeting that is not referred to in\nthe accompanying notice other than the approval of the minutes of the last Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which action will not be\nconstrued as approval or disapproval of any of the matters referred to in such minutes. As to other business that may properly come\nbefore the meeting, it is intended that proxies properly executed and returned will be voted in respect thereof at the discretion of the\nperson voting the proxies in accordance with his or her best judgment, including upon any shareholder proposal about which the\nCorporation did not receive timely notice.\nAnnual Report\nThe Annual Report to the Shareholders for 2023 accompanies this proxy statement, but is not deemed a part of the proxy\nsoliciting material.\nA copy of the 2023 Form 10-K report as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, excluding exhibits, will be\nmailed to shareholders without charge upon written request to: Corporate Secretary, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., 3555 Farnam\nStreet, Omaha, NE 68131. Such request must set forth a good-faith representation that the requesting party was either a\nholder of record or a beneficial owner of Class A or Class B Stock of the Corporation on March 6, 2024. Exhibits to the Form\n10-K will be mailed upon similar request and payment of specified fees. The 2023 Form 10-K is also available through the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission’s website (www.sec.gov).\nProposals of Shareholders\nAny shareholder proposal intended to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement for presentation at the 2025 Annual\nMeeting must be received by the Corporation by November 15, 2024. The proposal must be in accordance with the provisions of\nRule 14a-8 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. It is suggested the\nproposal be submitted by certified mail – return receipt requested. Shareholders who intend to present a proposal at the 2025 Annual\nMeeting without including such proposal in the Corporation’s proxy statement must provide the Corporation notice of such proposal\nno later than February 5, 2025. The Corporation reserves the right to reject, rule out of order or take other appropriate action with\nrespect to any proposal that does not comply with these and other applicable requirements.\nBy order of the Board of Directors\nMARC D.

          "content": "Charlie Munger – The Architect of Berkshire Hathaway\nCharlie Munger died on November 28, just 33 days before his 100th birthday.\nThough born and raised in Omaha, he spent 80% of his life domiciled\nelsewhere. Consequently, it was not until 1959 when he was 35 that I first met him.\nIn 1962, he decided that he should take up money management.\nThree years later he told me – correctly! – that I had made a dumb decision in\nbuying control of Berkshire. But, he assured me, since I had already made the move,\nhe would tell me how to correct my mistake.\nIn what I next relate, bear in mind that Charlie and his family did not have a\ndime invested in the small investing partnership that I was then managing and whose\nmoney I had used for the Berkshire purchase. Moreover, neither of us expected that\nCharlie would ever own a share of Berkshire stock.\nNevertheless, Charlie, in 1965, promptly advised me: “Warren, forget about\never buying another company like Berkshire. But now that you control Berkshire, add\nto it wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices and give up buying fair businesses\nat wonderful prices. In other words, abandon everything you learned from your hero,\nBen Graham. It works but only when practiced at small scale.” With much back-sliding\nI subsequently followed his instructions.\nMany years later, Charlie became my partner in running Berkshire and,\nrepeatedly, jerked me back to sanity when my old habits surfaced. Until his death, he\ncontinued in this role and together we, along with those who early on invested with\nus, ended up far better off than Charlie and I had ever dreamed possible.\nIn reality, Charlie was the “architect” of the present Berkshire, and I acted as\nthe “general contractor” to carry out the day-by-day construction of his vision.\nCharlie never sought to take credit for his role as creator but instead let me\ntake the bows and receive the accolades. In a way his relationship with me was part\nolder brother, part loving father. Even when he knew he was right, he gave me the\nreins, and when I blundered he never – never –reminded me of my mistake.\nIn the physical world, great buildings are linked to their architect while those\nwho had poured the concrete or installed the windows are soon forgotten. Berkshire\nhas become a great company. Though I have long been in charge of the construction\ncrew; Charlie should forever be credited with being the architect.\n2\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.\nTo the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:\nBerkshire has more than three million shareholder accounts. I am charged with writing a\nletter every year that will be useful to this diverse and ever-changing group of owners, many of\nwhom wish to learn more about their investment.\nCharlie Munger, for decades my partner in managing Berkshire, viewed this obligation\nidentically and would expect me to communicate with you this year in the regular manner. He and\nI were of one mind regarding our responsibilities to Berkshire shareholders.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nWriters find it useful to picture the reader they seek, and often they are hoping to attract a\nmass audience. At Berkshire, we have a more limited target: investors who trust Berkshire with\ntheir savings without any expectation of resale (resembling in attitude people who save in order to\nbuy a farm or rental property rather than people who prefer using their excess funds to purchase\nlottery tickets or “hot” stocks).\nOver the years, Berkshire has attracted an unusual number of such “lifetime” shareholders\nand their heirs. We cherish their presence and believe they are entitled to hear every year both the\ngood and bad news, delivered directly from their CEO and not from an investor-relations officer\nor communications consultant forever serving up optimism and syrupy mush.\nIn visualizing the owners that Berkshire seeks, I am lucky to have the perfect mental model,\nmy sister, Bertie. Let me introduce her.\nFor openers, Bertie is smart, wise and likes to challenge my thinking. We have never,\nhowever, had a shouting match or anything close to a ruptured relationship. We never will.\nFurthermore, Bertie, and her three daughters as well, have a large portion of their savings\nin Berkshire shares. Their ownership spans decades, and every year Bertie will read what I have\nto say. My job is to anticipate her questions and give her honest answers.\n3\nBertie, like most of you, understands many accounting terms, but she is not ready for a\nCPA exam. She follows business news – reading four newspapers daily – but doesn’t consider\nherself an economic expert. She is sensible – very sensible – instinctively knowing that pundits\nshould always be ignored. After all, if she could reliably predict tomorrow’s winners, would she\nfreely share her valuable insights and thereby increase competitive buying? That would be like\nfinding gold and then handing a map to the neighbors showing its location.\nBertie understands the power – for good or bad – of incentives, the weaknesses of humans,\nthe “tells” that can be recognized when observing human behavior. She knows who is “selling”\nand who can be trusted. In short, she is nobody’s fool.\nSo, what would interest Bertie this year?\nOperating Results, Fact and Fiction\nLet’s begin with the numbers. The official annual report begins on K-1 and extends for 124\npages. It is filled with a vast amount of information – some important, some trivial.\nAmong its disclosures many owners, along with financial reporters, will focus on page\nK-72. There, they will find the proverbial “bottom line” labeled “Net earnings (loss).” The\nnumbers read $90 billion for 2021, ($23 billion) for 2022 and $96 billion for 2023.\nWhat in the world is going on?\nYou seek guidance and are told that the procedures for calculating these “earnings” are\npromulgated by a sober and credentialed Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”),\nmandated by a dedicated and hard-working Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and\naudited by the world-class professionals at Deloitte & Touche (“D&T”). On page K-67, D&T pulls\nno punches: “In our opinion, the financial statements . . . . . present fairly, in all material respects\n(italics mine), the financial position of the Company . . . . . and the results of its operations . . . . .\nfor each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 . . . . .”\nSo sanctified, this worse-than-useless “net income” figure quickly gets transmitted\nthroughout the world via the internet and media. All parties believe they have done their job – and,\nlegally, they have.\nWe, however, are left uncomfortable. At Berkshire, our view is that “earnings” should be a\nsensible concept that Bertie will find somewhat useful – but only as a starting point – in\nevaluating a business. Accordingly, Berkshire also reports to Bertie and you what we call\n“operating earnings.” Here is the story they tell: $27.6 billion for 2021; $30.9 billion for 2022 and\n$37.4 billion for 2023.\n4\nThe primary difference between the mandated figures and the ones Berkshire prefers is that\nwe exclude unrealized capital gains or losses that at times can exceed $5 billion a day. Ironically,\nour preference was pretty much the rule until 2018, when the “improvement” was mandated.\nGalileo’s experience, several centuries ago, should have taught us not to mess with mandates from\non high. But, at Berkshire, we can be stubborn.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nMake no mistake about the significance of capital gains: I expect them to be a very\nimportant component of Berkshire’s value accretion during the decades ahead. Why else would\nwe commit huge dollar amounts of your money (and Bertie’s) to marketable equities just as I have\nbeen doing with my own funds throughout my investing lifetime?\nI can’t remember a period since March 11, 1942 – the date of my first stock purchase – that\nI have not had a majority of my net worth in equities, U.S.-based equities. And so far, so good.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell below 100 on that fateful day in 1942 when I “pulled the\ntrigger.” I was down about $5 by the time school was out. Soon, things turned around and now that\nindex hovers around 38,000. America has been a terrific country for investors. All they have\nneeded to do is sit quietly, listening to no one.\nIt is more than silly, however, to make judgments about Berkshire’s investment value based\non “earnings” that incorporate the capricious day-by-day and, yes, even year-by-year movements\nof the stock market. As Ben Graham taught me, “In the short run the market acts as a voting\nmachine; in the long run it becomes a weighing machine.”\nWhat We Do\nOur goal at Berkshire is simple: We want to own either all or a portion of businesses that\nenjoy good economics that are fundamental and enduring. Within capitalism, some businesses will\nflourish for a very long time while others will prove to be sinkholes. It’s harder than you would\nthink to predict which will be the winners and losers. And those who tell you they know the answer\nare usually either self-delusional or snake-oil salesmen.\nAt Berkshire, we particularly favor the rare enterprise that can deploy additional capital at\nhigh returns in the future. Owning only one of these companies – and simply sitting tight – can\ndeliver wealth almost beyond measure. Even heirs to such a holding can – ugh! – sometimes live\na lifetime of leisure.\nWe also hope these favored businesses are run by able and trustworthy managers, though\nthat is a more difficult judgment to make, however, and Berkshire has had its share\nof disappointments.\n5\nIn 1863, Hugh McCulloch, the first Comptroller of the United States, sent a letter to all\nnational banks. His instructions included this warning: “Never deal with a rascal under the\nexpectation that you can prevent him from cheating you.” Many bankers who thought they could\n“manage” the rascal problem have learned the wisdom of Mr. McCulloch’s advice – and I have as\nwell. People are not that easy to read. Sincerity and empathy can easily be faked. That is as true\nnow as it was in 1863.\nThis combination of the two necessities I’ve described for acquiring businesses has for\nlong been our goal in purchases and, for a while, we had an abundance of candidates to evaluate.\nIf I missed one – and I missed plenty – another always came along.\nThose days are long behind us; size did us in, though increased competition for purchases\nwas also a factor.\nBerkshire now has – by far – the largest GAAP net worth recorded by any American\nbusiness. Record operating income and a strong stock market led to a yearend figure of $561\nbillion. The total GAAP net worth for the other 499 S&P companies – a who’s who of American\nbusiness – was $8.9 trillion in 2022. (The 2023 number for the S&P has not yet been tallied but is\nunlikely to materially exceed $9.5 trillion.)\nBy this measure, Berkshire now occupies nearly 6% of the universe in which it operates.\nDoubling our huge base is simply not possible within, say, a five-year period, particularly because\nwe are highly averse to issuing shares (an act that immediately juices net worth).\nThere remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the\nneedle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others. Some we can\nvalue; some we can’t. And, if we can, they have to be attractively priced. Outside the U.S., there\nare essentially no candidates that are meaningful options for capital deployment at Berkshire. All\nin all, we have no possibility of eye-popping performance.\nNevertheless, managing Berkshire is mostly fun and always interesting. On the positive\nside, after 59 years of assemblage, the company now owns either a portion or 100% of various\nbusinesses that, on a weighted basis, have somewhat better prospects than exist at most large\nAmerican companies. By both luck and pluck, a few huge winners have emerged from a great\nmany dozens of decisions. And we now have a small cadre of long-time managers who never muse\nabout going elsewhere and who regard 65 as just another birthday.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nBerkshire benefits from an unusual constancy and clarity of purpose. While we emphasize\ntreating our employees, communities and suppliers well – who wouldn’t wish to do so? – our\nallegiance will always be to our country and our shareholders. We never forget that, though your\nmoney is comingled with ours, it does not belong to us.\n6\nWith that focus, and with our present mix of businesses, Berkshire should do a bit better\nthan the average American corporation and, more important, should also operate with materially\nless risk of permanent loss of capital. Anything beyond “slightly better,” though, is wishful\nthinking. This modest aspiration wasn’t the case when Bertie went all-in on Berkshire – but it\nis now.\nOur Not-So-Secret Weapon\nOccasionally, markets and/or the economy will cause stocks and bonds of some large and\nfundamentally good businesses to be strikingly mispriced. Indeed, markets can – and\nwill – unpredictably seize up or even vanish as they did for four months in 1914 and for a few days\nin 2001. If you believe that American investors are now more stable than in the past, think back to\nSeptember 2008. Speed of communication and the wonders of technology facilitate instant\nworldwide paralysis, and we have come a long way since smoke signals. Such instant panics won’t\nhappen often – but they will happen.\nBerkshire’s ability to immediately respond to market seizures with both huge sums and\ncertainty of performance may offer us an occasional large-scale opportunity. Though the stock\nmarket is massively larger than it was in our early years, today’s active participants are neither\nmore emotionally stable nor better taught than when I was in school. For whatever reasons, markets\nnow exhibit far more casino-like behavior than they did when I was young. The casino now resides\nin many homes and daily tempts the occupants.\nOne fact of financial life should never be forgotten. Wall Street – to use the term in its\nfigurative sense – would like its customers to make money, but what truly causes its denizens’\njuices to flow is feverish activity. At such times, whatever foolishness can be marketed will be\nvigorously marketed – not by everyone but always by someone.\nOccasionally, the scene turns ugly. The politicians then become enraged; the most flagrant\nperpetrators of misdeeds slip away, rich and unpunished; and your friend next door becomes\nbewildered, poorer and sometimes vengeful. Money, he learns, has trumped morality.\nOne investment rule at Berkshire has not and will not change: Never risk permanent loss\nof capital. Thanks to the American tailwind and the power of compound interest, the arena in which\nwe operate has been – and will be – rewarding if you make a couple of good decisions during a\nlifetime and avoid serious mistakes.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nI believe Berkshire can handle financial disasters of a magnitude beyond any heretofore\nexperienced. This ability is one we will not relinquish. When economic upsets occur, as they will,\nBerkshire’s goal will be to function as an asset to the country – just as it was in a very minor way\nin 2008-9 – and to help extinguish the financial fire rather than to be among the many companies\nthat, inadvertently or otherwise, ignited the conflagration.\n7\nOur goal is realistic. Berkshire’s strength comes from its Niagara of diverse earnings\ndelivered after interest costs, taxes and substantial charges for depreciation and amortization\n(“EBITDA” is a banned measurement at Berkshire). We also operate with minimal requirements\nfor cash, even if the country encounters a prolonged period of global economic weakness, fear and\nnear-paralysis.\nBerkshire does not currently pay dividends, and its share repurchases are 100%\ndiscretionary. Annual debt maturities are never material.\nYour company also holds a cash and U.S. Treasury bill position far in excess of what\nconventional wisdom deems necessary. During the 2008 panic, Berkshire generated cash from\noperations and did not rely in any manner on commercial paper, bank lines or debt markets. We\ndid not predict the time of an economic paralysis but we were always prepared for one.\nExtreme fiscal conservatism is a corporate pledge we make to those who have joined us in\nownership of Berkshire. In most years – indeed in most decades – our caution will likely prove to\nbe unneeded behavior – akin to an insurance policy on a fortress-like building thought to be\nfireproof. But Berkshire does not want to inflict permanent financial damage – quotational\nshrinkage for extended periods can’t be avoided – on Bertie or any of the individuals who have\ntrusted us with their savings.\nBerkshire is built to last.\nNon-controlled Businesses That Leave Us Comfortable\nLast year I mentioned two of Berkshire’s long-duration partial-ownership\npositions – Coca-Cola and American Express. These are not huge commitments like our Apple\nposition. Each only accounts for 4-5% of Berkshire’s GAAP net worth. But they are meaningful\nassets and also illustrate our thought processes.\nAmerican Express began operations in 1850, and Coca-Cola was launched in an Atlanta\ndrug store in 1886. (Berkshire is not big on newcomers.) Both companies tried expanding into\nunrelated areas over the years and both found little success in these attempts. In the past – but\ndefinitely not now – both were even mismanaged.\nBut each was hugely successful in its base business, reshaped here and there as conditions\ncalled for. And, crucially, their products “traveled.” Both Coke and AMEX became recognizable\nnames worldwide as did their core products, and the consumption of liquids and the need for\nunquestioned financial trust are timeless essentials of our world.\n8\nDuring 2023, we did not buy or sell a share of either AMEX or Coke – extending our own\nRip Van Winkle slumber that has now lasted well over two decades. Both companies again\nrewarded our inaction last year by increasing their earnings and dividends. Indeed, our share of\nAMEX earnings in 2023 considerably exceeded the $1.3 billion cost of our long-ago purchase.\nBoth AMEX and Coke will almost certainly increase their dividends in 2024 – about 16%\nin the case of AMEX – and we will most certainly leave our holdings untouched throughout the\nyear. Could I create a better worldwide business than these two enjoy? As Bertie will tell\nyou: “No way.”\nThough Berkshire did not purchase shares of either company in 2023, your indirect\nownership of both Coke and AMEX increased a bit last year because of share repurchases we made\nat Berkshire. Such repurchases work to increase your participation in every asset that Berkshire\nowns. To this obvious but often overlooked truth, I add my usual caveat: All stock repurchases\nshould be price-dependent. What is sensible at a discount to business-value becomes stupid if done\nat a premium.\nThe lesson from Coke and AMEX? When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with\nit. Patience pays, and one wonderful business can offset the many mediocre decisions that\nare inevitable.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nThis year, I would like to describe two other investments that we expect to maintain\nindefinitely. Like Coke and AMEX, these commitments are not huge relative to our resources.\nThey are worthwhile, however, and we were able to increase both positions during 2023.\nAt yearend, Berkshire owned 27.8% of Occidental Petroleum’s common shares and also\nowned warrants that, for more than five years, give us the option to materially increase our\nownership at a fixed price. Though we very much like our ownership, as well as the option,\nBerkshire has no interest in purchasing or managing Occidental. We particularly like its vast oil\nand gas holdings in the United States, as well as its leadership in carbon-capture initiatives, though\nthe economic feasibility of this technique has yet to be proven. Both of these activities are very\nmuch in our country’s interest.\nNot so long ago, the U.S. was woefully dependent on foreign oil, and carbon capture had\nno meaningful constituency. Indeed, in 1975, U.S. production was eight million barrels of\noil-equivalent per day (“BOEPD”), a level far short of the country’s needs. From the favorable\nenergy position that facilitated the U.S. mobilization in World War II, the country had retreated to\nbecome heavily dependent on foreign – potentially unstable – suppliers. Further declines in oil\nproduction were predicted along with future increases in usage.\n9\nFor a long time, the pessimism appeared to be correct, with production falling to five\nmillion BOEPD by 2007. Meanwhile, the U.S. government created a Strategic Petroleum Reserve\n(“SPR”) in 1975 to alleviate – though not come close to eliminating – this erosion of American\nself-sufficiency.\nAnd then – Hallelujah! – shale economics became feasible in 2011, and our energy\ndependency ended. Now, U.S. production is more than 13 million BOEPD, and OPEC no longer\nhas the upper hand. Occidental itself has annual U.S. oil production that each year comes close to\nmatching the entire inventory of the SPR. Our country would be very – very – nervous today if\ndomestic production had remained at five million BOEPD, and it found itself hugely dependent\non non-U.S. sources. At that level, the SPR would have been emptied within months if foreign oil\nbecame unavailable.\nUnder Vicki Hollub’s leadership, Occidental is doing the right things for both its country\nand its owners. No one knows what oil prices will do over the next month, year, or decade. But\nVicki does know how to separate oil from rock, and that’s an uncommon talent, valuable to her\nshareholders and to her country.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nAdditionally, Berkshire continues to hold its passive and long-term interest in five very\nlarge Japanese companies, each of which operates in a highly-diversified manner somewhat similar\nto the way Berkshire itself is run. We increased our holdings in all five last year after Greg Abel\nand I made a trip to Tokyo to talk with their managements.\nBerkshire now owns about 9% of each of the five. (A minor point: Japanese companies\ncalculate outstanding shares in a manner different from the practice in the U.S.) Berkshire has also\npledged to each company that it will not purchase shares that will take our holdings beyond 9.9%.\nOur cost for the five totals ¥1.6 trillion, and the yearend market value of the five was ¥2.9 trillion.\nHowever, the yen has weakened in recent years and our yearend unrealized gain in dollars was\n61% or $8 billion.\nNeither Greg nor I believe we can forecast market prices of major currencies. We also don’t\nbelieve we can hire anyone with this ability. Therefore, Berkshire has financed most of its Japanese\nposition with the proceeds from ¥1.3 trillion of bonds. This debt has been very well-received in\nJapan, and I believe Berkshire has more yen-denominated debt outstanding than any other\nAmerican company. The weakened yen has produced a yearend gain for Berkshire of $1.9 billion,\na sum that, pursuant to GAAP rules, has periodically been recognized in income over the\n2020-23 period.\nIn certain important ways, all five companies – Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and\nSumitomo – follow shareholder-friendly policies that are much superior to those customarily\npracticed in the U.S. Since we began our Japanese purchases, each of the five has reduced the\nnumber of its outstanding shares at attractive prices.\n10\nMeanwhile, the managements of all five companies have been far less aggressive about\ntheir own compensation than is typical in the United States. Note as well that each of the five is\napplying only about 1⁄\n3\nof its earnings to dividends. The large sums the five retain are used both to\nbuild their many businesses and, to a lesser degree, to repurchase shares. Like Berkshire, the five\ncompanies are reluctant to issue shares.\nAn additional benefit for Berkshire is the possibility that our investment may lead to\nopportunities for us to partner around the world with five large, well-managed and well-respected\ncompanies. Their interests are far more broad than ours. And, on their side, the Japanese CEOs\nhave the comfort of knowing that Berkshire will always possess huge liquid resources that can be\ninstantly available for such partnerships, whatever their size may be.\nOur Japanese purchases began on July 4, 2019. Given Berkshire’s present size, building\npositions through open-market purchases takes a lot of patience and an extended period of\n“friendly” prices. The process is like turning a battleship. That is an important disadvantage which\nwe did not face in our early days at Berkshire.\nThe Scorecard in 2023\nEvery quarter we issue a press release that reports our summarized operating earnings (or\nloss) in a manner similar to what is shown below. Here is the full-year compilation:\n(in $ millions)\n2023 2022\nInsurance-underwriting ...................... $ 5,428 $ (30)\nInsurance-investment income ................. 9,567 6,484\nRailroad .................................. 5,087 5,946\nUtilities and energy ......................... 2,331 3,904\nOther businesses and miscellaneous items ....... 14,937 14,549\nOperating earnings .......................... $37,350 $30,853\nAt Berkshire’s annual gathering on May 6, 2023, I presented the first quarter’s results\nwhich had been released early that morning. I followed with a short summary of the outlook for\nthe full year: (1) most of our non-insurance businesses faced lower earnings in 2023; (2) that\ndecline would be cushioned by decent results at our two largest non-insurance businesses, BNSF\nand Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) which, combined, had accounted for more than 30% of\noperating earnings in 2022; (3) our investment income was certain to materially grow because the\nhuge U.S. Treasury bill position held by Berkshire had finally begun to pay us far more than the\npittance we had been receiving and (4) insurance would likely do well, both because its\nunderwriting earnings are not correlated to earnings elsewhere in the economy and, beyond that,\nproperty-casualty insurance prices had strengthened.\n11\nInsurance came through as expected. I erred, however, in my expectations for both BNSF\nand BHE. Let’s take a look at each.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nRail is essential to America’s economic future. It is clearly the most efficient\nway – measured by cost, fuel usage and carbon intensity – of moving heavy materials to distant\ndestinations. Trucking wins for short hauls, but many goods that Americans need must travel to\ncustomers many hundreds or even several thousands of miles away. The country can’t run without\nrail, and the industry’s capital needs will always be huge. Indeed, compared to most American\nbusinesses, railroads eat capital.\nBNSF is the largest of six major rail systems that blanket North America. Our railroad\ncarries its 23,759 miles of main track, 99 tunnels, 13,495 bridges, 7,521 locomotives and assorted\nother fixed assets at $70 billion on its balance sheet. But my guess is that it would cost at least\n$500 billion to replicate those assets and decades to complete the job.\nBNSF must annually spend more than its depreciation charge to simply maintain its present\nlevel of business. This reality is bad for owners, whatever the industry in which they have invested,\nbut it is particularly disadvantageous in capital-intensive industries.\nAt BNSF, the outlays in excess of GAAP depreciation charges since our purchase 14 years\nago have totaled a staggering $22 billion or more than $11⁄\n2\nbillion annually. Ouch! That sort of\ngap means BNSF dividends paid to Berkshire, its owner, will regularly fall considerably short of\nBNSF’s reported earnings unless we regularly increase the railroad’s debt. And that we do not\nintend to do.\nConsequently, Berkshire is receiving an acceptable return on its purchase price, though less\nthan it might appear, and also a pittance on the replacement value of the property. That’s no\nsurprise to me or Berkshire’s board of directors. It explains why we could buy BNSF in 2010 at a\nsmall fraction of its replacement value.\nNorth America’s rail system moves huge quantities of coal, grain, autos, imported and\nexported goods, etc. one-way for long distances and those trips often create a revenue problem for\nback-hauls. Weather conditions are extreme and frequently hamper or even stymie the utilization\nof track, bridges and equipment. Flooding can be a nightmare. None of this is a surprise. While I\nsit in an always-comfortable office, railroading is an outdoor activity with many employees\nworking under trying and sometimes dangerous conditions.\nAn evolving problem is that a growing percentage of Americans are not looking for the\ndifficult, and often lonely, employment conditions inherent in some rail operations. Engineers must\ndeal with the fact that among an American population of 335 million, some forlorn or\nmentally-disturbed Americans are going to elect suicide by lying in front of a 100-car,\nextraordinarily heavy train that can’t be stopped in less than a mile or more. Would you like to be\nthe helpless engineer? This trauma happens about once a day in North America; it is far more\ncommon in Europe and will always be with us.\n12\nWage negotiations in the rail industry can end up in the hands of the President and\nCongress. Additionally, American railroads are required to carry many dangerous products every\nday that the industry would much rather avoid. The words “common carrier” define\nrailroad responsibilities.\nLast year BNSF’s earnings declined more than I expected, as revenues fell. Though fuel\ncosts also fell, wage increases, promulgated in Washington, were far beyond the country’s inflation\ngoals. This differential may recur in future negotiations.\nThough BNSF carries more freight and spends more on capital expenditures than any of\nthe five other major North American railroads, its profit margins have slipped relative to all five\nsince our purchase. I believe that our vast service territory is second to none and that therefore our\nmargin comparisons can and should improve.\nI am particularly proud of both BNSF’s contribution to the country and the people who\nwork in sub-zero outdoor jobs in North Dakota and Montana winters to keep America’s\ncommercial arteries open. Railroads don’t get much attention when they are working but, were\nthey unavailable, the void would be noticed immediately throughout America.\nA century from now, BNSF will continue to be a major asset of the country and of\nBerkshire. You can count on that.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nOur second and even more severe earnings disappointment last year occurred at BHE. Most\nof its large electric-utility businesses, as well as its extensive gas pipelines, performed about as\nexpected. But the regulatory climate in a few states has raised the specter of zero profitability or\neven bankruptcy (an actual outcome at California’s largest utility and a current threat in Hawaii).\nIn such jurisdictions, it is difficult to project both earnings and asset values in what was once\nregarded as among the most stable industries in America.\nFor more than a century, electric utilities raised huge sums to finance their growth through\na state-by-state promise of a fixed return on equity (sometimes with a small bonus for superior\nperformance). With this approach, massive investments were made for capacity that would likely\nbe required a few years down the road. That forward-looking regulation reflected the reality that\nutilities build generating and transmission assets that often take many years to construct. BHE’s\nextensive multi-state transmission project in the West was initiated in 2006 and remains some\nyears from completion. Eventually, it will serve 10 states comprising 30% of the acreage in the\ncontinental United States.\nWith this model employed by both private and public-power systems, the lights stayed on,\neven if population growth or industrial demand exceeded expectations. The “margin of safety”\napproach seemed sensible to regulators, investors and the public. Now, the fixed-but-satisfactory-\nreturn pact has been broken in a few states, and investors are becoming apprehensive that such\nruptures may spread. Climate change adds to their worries. Underground transmission may be\nrequired but who, a few decades ago, wanted to pay the staggering costs for such construction?\n13\nAt Berkshire, we have made a best estimate for the amount of losses that have occurred.\nThese costs arose from forest fires, whose frequency and intensity have increased – and will likely\ncontinue to increase – if convective storms become more frequent.\nIt will be many years until we know the final tally from BHE’s forest-fire losses and can\nintelligently make decisions about the desirability of future investments in vulnerable western\nstates. It remains to be seen whether the regulatory environment will change elsewhere.\nOther electric utilities may face survival problems resembling those of Pacific Gas and\nElectric and Hawaiian Electric. A confiscatory resolution of our present problems would obviously\nbe a negative for BHE, but both that company and Berkshire itself are structured to survive\nnegative surprises. We regularly get these in our insurance business, where our basic product is\nrisk assumption, and they will occur elsewhere. Berkshire can sustain financial surprises but we\nwill not knowingly throw good money after bad.\nWhatever the case at Berkshire, the final result for the utility industry may be ominous:\nCertain utilities might no longer attract the savings of American citizens and will be forced to\nadopt the public-power model. Nebraska made this choice in the 1930s and there are many\npublic-power operations throughout the country. Eventually, voters, taxpayers and users will\ndecide which model they prefer.\nWhen the dust settles, America’s power needs and the consequent capital expenditure will\nbe staggering. I did not anticipate or even consider the adverse developments in regulatory returns\nand, along with Berkshire’s two partners at BHE, I made a costly mistake in not doing so.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nEnough about problems: Our insurance business performed exceptionally well last year,\nsetting records in sales, float and underwriting profits. Property-casualty insurance (“P/C”)\nprovides the core of Berkshire’s well-being and growth. We have been in the business for 57 years\nand despite our nearly 5,000-fold increase in volume – from $17 million to $83 billion – we have\nmuch room to grow.\nBeyond that, we have learned – too often, painfully – a good deal about what types of\ninsurance business and what sort of people to avoid. The most important lesson is that our\nunderwriters can be thin, fat, male, female, young, old, foreign or domestic. But they can’t be\noptimists at the office, however desirable that quality may generally be in life.\nSurprises in the P/C business – which can occur decades after six-month or one-year\npolicies have expired – are almost always negative. The industry’s accounting is designed to\nrecognize this reality, but estimation mistakes can be huge. And when charlatans are involved,\ndetection is often both slow and costly. Berkshire will always attempt to be accurate in its estimates\nof future loss payments but inflation – both monetary and the “legal” variety – is a wild card.\n14\nI’ve told the story of our insurance operations so many times that I will simply direct\nnewcomers to page 18. Here, I will only repeat that our position would not be what it is if Ajit Jain\nhad not joined Berkshire in 1986. Before that lucky day – aside from an almost unbelievably\nwonderful experience with GEICO that began early in 1951 and will never end – I was largely\nwandering in the wilderness, as I struggled to build our insurance operation.\nAjit’s achievements since joining Berkshire have been supported by a large cast of\nhugely-talented insurance executives in our various P/C operations. Their names and faces are\nunknown to most of the press and the public. Berkshire’s lineup of managers, however, is to P/C\ninsurance what Cooperstown’s honorees are to baseball.\nBertie, you can feel good about the fact that you own a piece of an incredible P/C operation\nthat now operates worldwide with unmatched financial resources, reputation and talent. It carried\nthe day in 2023.\nWhat is it with Omaha?\nCome to Berkshire’s annual gathering on May 4, 2024. On stage you will see the three\nmanagers who now bear the prime responsibilities for steering your company. What, you may\nwonder, do the three have in common? They certainly don’t look alike. Let’s dig deeper.\nGreg Abel, who runs all non-insurance operations for Berkshire – and in all respects is\nready to be CEO of Berkshire tomorrow – was born and raised in Canada (he still plays hockey).\nIn the 1990s, however, Greg lived for six years in Omaha just a few blocks away from me. During\nthat period, I never met him.\nA decade or so earlier, Ajit Jain, who was born, raised and educated in India, lived with his\nfamily in Omaha only a mile or so from my home (where I’ve lived since 1958). Both Ajit and his\nwife, Tinku, have many Omaha friends, though it’s been more than three decades since they moved\nto New York (in order to be where much of the action in reinsurance takes place).\nMissing from the stage this year will be Charlie. He and I were both born in Omaha about\ntwo miles from where you will sit at our May get-together. In his first ten years, Charlie lived\nabout a half-mile from where Berkshire has long maintained its office. Both Charlie and I spent\nour early years in Omaha public schools and were indelibly shaped by our Omaha childhood. We\ndidn’t meet, however, until much later. (A footnote that may surprise you: Charlie lived under 15\nof America’s 45 presidents. People refer to President Biden as #46, but that numbering counts\nGrover Cleveland as both #22 and #24 because his terms were not consecutive. America is a very\nyoung country.)\n15\nMoving to the corporate level, Berkshire itself relocated in 1970 from its 81 years of\nresidence in New England to settle in Omaha, leaving its troubles behind and blossoming in its\nnew home.\nAs a final punctuation point to the “Omaha Effect,” Bertie – yes that Bertie – spent her\nearly formative years in a middle-class neighborhood in Omaha and, many decades later, emerged\nas one of the country’s great investors.\nYou may be thinking that she put all of her money in Berkshire and then simply sat on it.\nBut that’s not true. After starting a family in 1956, Bertie was active financially for 20 years:\nholding bonds, putting 1⁄\n3\nof her funds in a publicly-held mutual fund and trading stocks with some\nfrequency. Her potential remained unnoticed.\nThen, in 1980, when 46, and independent of any urgings from her brother, Bertie decided\nto make her move. Retaining only the mutual fund and Berkshire, she made no new trades during\nthe next 43 years. During that period, she became very rich, even after making large philanthropic\ngifts (think nine figures).\nMillions of American investors could have followed her reasoning which involved only\nthe common sense she had somehow absorbed as a child in Omaha. And, taking no chances, Bertie\nreturns to Omaha every May to be re-energized.\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\nSo what is going on? Is it Omaha’s water? Is it Omaha’s air? Is it some strange planetary\nphenomenon akin to that which has produced Jamaica’s sprinters, Kenya’s marathon runners, or\nRussia’s chess experts? Must we wait until AI someday yields the answer to this puzzle?\nKeep an open mind. Come to Omaha in May, inhale the air, drink the water and say “hi”\nto Bertie and her good-looking daughters. Who knows? There is no downside, and, in any event,\nyou will have a good time and meet a huge crowd of friendly people.\nTo top things off, we will have available the new 4th edition of Poor Charlie’s Almanack.\nPick up a copy. Charlie’s wisdom will improve your life as it has mine.\nFebruary 24, 2024 Warren E.
