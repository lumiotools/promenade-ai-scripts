(Nasdaq: PXDT) (the \"Company\"), a Japanese technology company focused on commercializing innovative products and materials utilizing proprietary wave control technology, today announced the launch of its new product VUEVO™ Display, which provides a window to serve global customers with real-time subtitling and translation in over 100 languages.\n\n## Background\n\nIn recent years, with the rise in in-bound tourism and the increase in the number of foreigners living in Japan, there is an increasing need for multilingual support at the reception counters of commercial facilities, accommodation facilities, public transportation, and the like. However, the number of staff at the counter who can serve customers in multiple language tends to be limited in current situations. Therefore, such staff are unable to provide appropriate guidance to unexpected foreign customers and in some cases this results in a decline in customer satisfaction. In particular, it is extremely difficult to secure personnel who can speak languages other than English. In addition, the revised Act on the Elimination of Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities, which came into effect in April 2024, requires businesses to provide reasonable accommodation to people with disabilities, and calls for proactive responses. However, there are cases where it is not possible to provide sufficient reasonable accommodation when communicating with deaf or hard of hearing people at the counter or reception desk. As a result, there is a challenge for people with disabilities in not being able to receive appropriate guidance and to use services with confidence. In response to these challenges, the Company has started offering the \"VUEVO Display\" which utilizes its proprietary wireless microphone and voice recognition technology to display subtitles and translations of conversations on a transparent screen in real-time. The installation of the \"VUEVO Display\" will facilitate smooth communication between counter staff and customers, regardless of speaking in different languages or certain disabilities.\n\n## About \"VUEVO Display\"\n\n\"VUEVO Display\" is a service that allows the content of a conversation to be displayed on both sides of the transparent display in real-time by combining the technology cultivated through \"VUEVO\" (<https://vuevo.net>), a service that uses the Company's proprietary wireless microphones and its dedicated application, with translation functions and a transparent display. As the subtitles and translations are displayed on both sides of the transparent display, it will be possible to see the other person’s facial expressions and gestures and communicate smoothly face-to-face. \"VUEVO\" supports translation into over 100 languages and can be used when speaking with foreign customers or communicating with the hearing impaired or hard of hearing. With the \"VUEVO Display,\" the Company aims to create a world without communication barriers due to language differences or certain disabilities. URL: <https://vuevo.net/display/>\n\n## Main features of \"VUEVO Display\"\n\n■Real-time translation in over 100 languages Supports translation into over 100 languages. The conversation content is translated in real-time and displayed on the screen. The transparent display simultaneously shows what you are saying and the translated text, so you can check your spoken words while having a conversation.\n\n![](/news/news_20240801/feature_01@4x.png)\n\nJapanese, English, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Korean, German, Spanish, Filipino, French, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Malay, Russian, Thai, and Vietnamese. * Supports over 100 languages.\n\n![](/news/news_20240801/VUEVO-Display_0801_3.png)\n\n[Point-and-tap point-of-presence (\"POP\") to check the customer's language]\n\n■ Support for the hearing impaired and hard of hearing Support transcription into Japanese and provide reasonable accommodations for the deaf and hard of hearing. Because the spoken words are displayed on both sides of the display, it is possible to check whether it is being displayed correctly, ensuring peace of mind when receiving customer service. ■High-precision voice recognition using a proprietary microphone Our proprietary wireless microphone* allows a single microphone to separately recognize the voices of the receptionist and the customer. There is no need to switch languages during a conversation. The sound pickup range can be adjusted, allowing for highly accurate voice recognition without being affected by surrounding conversations.\n\n![](/news/news_20240801/feature_03@4x.png)\n\n■ Easy operation with dedicated app Operation is performed using a dedicated iPhone application. Simply select your language and start talking instantly. You can easily change settings such as text size, audio pickup range, and selected language from the app. ■ Space-saving installation The only equipment required is a transparent display, one wireless microphone, and an iPhone. This simple configuration allows for installation even in places with limited space. *Wi-Fi and power supply are required.\n\n![](/news/news_20240801/VUEVO-Display_0801_5.jpg)\n\n*The VUEVO Display is an application of the research results of the Digital Nature Group at the University of Tsukuba* (Representative: Associate Professor Yoichi Ochiai) on subtitle display. Technical details: <https://digitalnature.slis.tsukuba.ac.jp/2021/02/see-through-captions/> *The Company and the University of Tsukuba entered into a special joint research agreement in December 2017 and established the \"Digital Nature Promotion Strategic Research Base\" (commonly known as the Digital Nature Group powered by Pixie Dust Technologies) within the University of Tsukuba, working toward joint research and the continuous social implementation of research results.\n\n## Next deployment\n\nThe VUEVO Display is planned to be used at public transportation counters frequented by many foreign visitors to Japan, at hotel and accommodation reception desks, and at the reception desks of commercial facilities and office buildings where hospitality is required.\n\n## Forward-Looking Statements\n\nCertain statements contained in this press release are \"forward-looking statements\" made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Risk Rating Scale:\n1 (Low Risk) - The company operates in an industry where it has a strong position (for example a monopoly, high market share etc.) or operates in a regulated industry. The\nfuture outlook is stable or positive for the industry. The company generates positive free cash flow and has a history of profitability. The capital structure is conservative with\nlittle or no debt.\n2 (Below Average Risk) - The company operates in an industry where the fundamentals and outlook are positive. The industry and company are relatively less sensitive to\nsystematic risk than companies with a Risk Rating of 3. The company has a history of profitability and has demonstrated its ability to generate positive free cash flows (though\ncurrent free cash flow may be negative due to capital investment). The company’s capital structure is conservative with little to modest use of debt.\n3 (Average Risk) - The company operates in an industry that has average sensitivity to systematic risk. The industry may be cyclical. Profits and cash flow are sensitive to\neconomic factors although the company has demonstrated its ability to generate positive earnings and cash flow. Debt use is in line with industry averages, and coverage ratios\nare sufficient.\n4 (Speculative) - The company has little or no history of generating earnings or cash flow. Debt use is higher. These companies may be in start-up mode or in a turnaround\nsituation. These companies should be considered speculative.\n5 (Highly Speculative) - The company has no history of generating earnings or cash flow. They may operate in a new industry with new, and unproven products. Products may\nbe at the development stage, testing, or seeking regulatory approval. These companies may run into liquidity issues and may rely on external funding. These stocks are\nconsidered highly speculative.\nDisclaimers and Disclosure\nThe opinions expressed in this report are the true opinions of the analyst about this company and industry.

Currently, there are insufficient customer\nreviews to gauge the effectiveness of Pixie’s products. However, we consider the\ndistribution of Pixie products by major Japanese retail chains and electronic\nstores as a vote of confidence. Additionally, a positive indicator is that Pixie has\nalready sold 2,600+ units of SonoRepro in a relatively short span of time. In the\nnext 12 months, as more consumers test Pixie products, we will be able to assess\ntheir efficacy through product reviews and sales traction.\nRisks\nWe believe the company is exposed to the following key risks (not exhaustive):\n• Limited operational history\n• EBITDA has not yet turned positive\n• Competition\nWe are assigning a • Need to pursue equity financings to fund working capital, and R&D, until\nrisk rating of 4\nEBITDA turns positive\n(Speculative)\n• No guarantee that the company will be able to expand its products\ninternationally\n©2024 Fundamental Research Corp. “20+ Years of Bringing Undiscovered Investment Opportunities to the Forefront” www.researchfrc.com\nEquity Research\nPage 14 of 16\nAppendix\n©2024 Fundamental Research Corp. “20+ Years of Bringing Undiscovered Investment Opportunities to the Forefront” www.researchfrc.com\nEquity Research\nPage 15 of 16\n©2024 Fundamental Research Corp. “20+ Years of Bringing Undiscovered Investment Opportunities to the Forefront” www.researchfrc.com\nEquity Research\nPage 16 of 16\nFundamental Research Corp. Equity Rating Scale:\nBuy – Annual expected rate of return exceeds 12% or the expected return is commensurate with risk\nHold – Annual expected rate of return is between 5% and 12%\nSell – Annual expected rate of return is below 5% or the expected return is not commensurate with risk\nSuspended or Rating N/A— Coverage and ratings suspended until more information can be obtained from the company regarding recent events.\nFundamental Research Corp. Risk Rating Scale:\n1 (Low Risk) - The company operates in an industry where it has a strong position (for example a monopoly, high market share etc.) or operates in a regulated industry. The\nfuture outlook is stable or positive for the industry. The company generates positive free cash flow and has a history of profitability. The capital structure is conservative with\nlittle or no debt.\n2 (Below Average Risk) - The company operates in an industry where the fundamentals and outlook are positive. The industry and company are relatively less sensitive to\nsystematic risk than companies with a Risk Rating of 3. The company has a history of profitability and has demonstrated its ability to generate positive free cash flows (though\ncurrent free cash flow may be negative due to capital investment). The company’s capital structure is conservative with little to modest use of debt.\n3 (Average Risk) - The company operates in an industry that has average sensitivity to systematic risk. The industry may be cyclical. Profits and cash flow are sensitive to\neconomic factors although the company has demonstrated its ability to generate positive earnings and cash flow. Debt use is in line with industry averages, and coverage ratios\nare sufficient.\n4 (Speculative) - The company has little or no history of generating earnings or cash flow. Debt use is higher. These companies may be in start-up mode or in a turnaround\nsituation. These companies should be considered speculative.\n5 (Highly Speculative) - The company has no history of generating earnings or cash flow. They may operate in a new industry with new, and unproven products. Products may\nbe at the development stage, testing, or seeking regulatory approval. These companies may run into liquidity issues and may rely on external funding. These stocks are\nconsidered highly speculative.\nDisclaimers and Disclosure\nThe opinions expressed in this report are the true opinions of the analyst about this company and industry.

          "content": "PIXIE DUST TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nCODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS\nI. Introduction\nPixie Dust Technologies, Inc., a corporation with limited liability organized under the\nlaws of the Japan (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we” or “our”) require the\nhighest standards of professional and ethical conduct from its directors, corporate auditors,\nofficers, and employees. The Company’s reputation for honesty and integrity is key to the\nsuccess of its business. The Company intends that its business practices will comply with the\nlaws of all of the jurisdictions in which it operates and that honesty, integrity, and\naccountability will always characterize the Company’s business activity. No director, corporate\nauditor, officer, or employee may achieve results through violations of laws or regulations or\nunscrupulous dealings.\nThis Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (this “Code”) reflects the Company’s\ncommitment to this culture of honesty, integrity, and accountability and outlines the basic\nprinciples and policies with which all directors, corporate auditors, officers, and employees are\nexpected to comply. Therefore, we expect you to read this Code thoroughly and carefully.\nIn addition to following this Code in all aspects of your business activities, you are\nexpected to seek guidance in any situation where there is a question regarding compliance with\nthe Company’s policies and applicable laws. Cooperation with this Code is essential to the\ncontinued success of the Company’s business and the cultivation and maintenance of its\nreputation as a good corporate citizen. Misconduct is never justified, even where sanctioned or\nordered by someone in a position of higher management. No one, regardless of stature or\nposition, can authorize actions that are illegal, or that jeopardize or violate Company standards.\nWe note that this Code sets forth general principles of conduct and ethics and is\nintended to work in conjunction with other, more specific policies and procedures, such as the\nInsider Trading Policy, the Related Party Transactions Policy, and policies that apply to your\nparticular business area. All these policies can be found on our intranet, or our onboarding or\ncompliance materials distributed to you. You should refer to those policies and procedures for\nmore detail in the specified context.\nII. Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations\nCompliance with all laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the Company is critical\nto our reputation and continued success. This includes compliance with Japanese laws and\nregulations and all relevant laws and regulations in other jurisdictions in which we operate, that\nare applicable to, among other things, the manner in which we conduct our business (including\ncorporate and employee licensing requirements) and the collection, use, retention, protection,\ndisclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal information, as well as any securities\nexchange or other organization or body that regulates the Company. All directors, corporate\nauditors, officers, and employees must respect and obey the laws of the cities, states, and\ncountries in which the Company operates and avoid even the appearance of impropriety.\n-1-\nDirectors, corporate auditors, officers, or employees who fail to comply with this Code and\napplicable laws will be subject to disciplinary measures, up to and including termination of\nemployment.\nAlthough not all employees, officers, corporate auditors, and directors are expected to\nknow the details of all applicable laws, rules and regulations, it is important to know enough\nto determine when to seek advice from appropriate personnel. Questions about compliance\nshould be addressed to the Company’s administrative division.\nIII. Interactions with the Healthcare Community\n Promoting Our Products\nThe Company is committed to promoting its products and services based upon customer\nneeds and the merits of each product or service in a transparent and accurate manner. We\nencourage truthful and ethical communications with the healthcare community that will help\npeople in the healthcare community make informed and independent decisions about how they\ncan best utilize our services.\n Interacting with Healthcare Community\nOur interactions with healthcare community must always reflect our commitment to\nintegrity, accuracy, and transparency and adhere to our standards.\nThe Company also promotes scientific integrity and does not allow business pressures\nto influence this valuable collaboration that advances scientific and medical understanding.\n No “buying of business”\nThe Company will not provide anything of value to inappropriately influence any\nhealthcare professional’s judgment to choose the Company’s product or service nor create any\nmisperception that the Company is doing so.\nIV. Conflicts of Interest\nA conflict of interest occurs when your private interests or activities influence, or\nappear to influence, our ability to make business decisions in the Company’s best interest. For\nexample, conflicts may arise if:\n You cause the Company to engage in business transactions with a company that you,\nyour friends, or your relatives control without having obtained the appropriate prior\napprovals required.\n You are in a position to (i) compete with, rather than help, the Company or (ii) make a\nbusiness decision not on the basis of the Company’s interest but rather for your own\npersonal advantage.\n-2-\n You take actions, or have personal or family interests, that may make it difficult to\nperform your work (or discharge your duties and obligations) effectively.\n You, or any of your family members or affiliates, receive improper personal benefits\nother than gratuities and payments received or provided in compliance with the\napplicable policies, as a result of your position in the Company.\nThe safest way to ensure you are not involved in a conflict of interest, or a perceived\nconflict, is to simply disclose the activity. Failure to promptly disclose information about any\nactual or potential conflict may affect your employment status at the Company.\nIf you have an interest that may create a conflict:\n• Promptly inform your supervisor\n• Include the name of the third party and description of the conflict\nThis may include gifts or entertainment that are not nominal. Not sure whether to tell\nyour supervisor? When in doubt, disclose.\nCompany employees may also bring any conflict or potential conflict involving another\ndirector, corporate auditor, officer, or employee, to the attention of the Company’s\nadministrative division or internal audit division. If the concern requires confidentiality,\nincluding keeping particular individuals anonymous, then this confidentially will be protected,\nexcept to the extent necessary to conduct an effective investigation or as required by applicable\nlaw, regulation, or legal proceedings.\nV. Corporate Opportunities\nWhen carrying out your duties or responsibilities, you owe a duty to the Company to\nadvance its legitimate interests. Except as provided in the Company’s policies, directors,\ncorporate auditors, officers, and employees are prohibited from (i) taking for themselves\nopportunities that arise through the use of corporate property, information, or position, (ii)\nusing corporate property, information, or position for personal gain, and (iii) competing with\nthe Company.\nVI. Information Security\nThe Company has adopted an Information Security Rule and is committed to\nrespecting data privacy. The Company will apply reasonable controls and security measures\nwhen processing personal data within the Company and by its business partners.\nThe Company takes due care to prevent misuse of or unauthorized access to\npersonally identifiable health information within its control. All processing of personal data\n(e.g., data on patients, employees, business partners, customers, and suppliers) must be in\ncompliance with applicable data privacy standards and laws.\nVII. Public Reporting\n-3-\nFull, fair, accurate, and timely disclosure must be made in the reports and other\ndocuments that the Company files with, or submits to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission and in its other public communications. Such disclosure is critical to ensure that\nthe Company maintains its good reputation, complies with its obligations under the securities\nlaws and meets the expectations of its shareholders.\nPersons responsible for the preparation of such documents and reports and other public\ncommunications must exercise the highest standard of care in accordance with the following\nguidelines:\n• all accounting records, and the reports produced from such records, must\ncomply with all applicable laws;\n• all accounting records must fairly and accurately reflect the transactions or\noccurrences to which they relate;\n• all accounting records must fairly and accurately reflect in reasonable detail the\nCompany’s assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses;\n• accounting records must not contain any false or intentionally misleading\nentries;\n• no transactions should be intentionally misclassified as to accounts, departments,\nor accounting periods;\n• all transactions must be supported by accurate documentation in reasonable\ndetail and recorded in the proper account and in the proper accounting period;\n• no information should be concealed from the internal audit function or the\nindependent auditors; and\n• compliance with the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and\ndisclosure controls and procedures is required.\nVIII. Confidentiality\nDirectors, corporate auditors, officers, and employees must maintain and protect the\nconfidentiality of information entrusted to them by the Company, or that otherwise comes into\ntheir possession, during the course of their employment or while carrying out their duties and\nresponsibilities, except when disclosure is authorized by the Company or legally mandated.\nThe obligation to preserve confidential information continues even after directors, corporate\nauditors, officers, and employees leave the Company.\nConfidential information encompasses all non-public information (including, for\nexample, “inside information” (material, non-public information that has not publicly been\ndisclosed and has the potential to affect the price of a security) or information that suppliers,\npartners, and clients have entrusted to the Company that may be of use to competitors, or may\notherwise be harmful to the Company or its key stakeholders, if disclosed. Financial\n-4-\ninformation is of special sensitivity and should under all circumstances be considered\nconfidential, except where its disclosure is approved by the Company or when the information\nhas been publicly disseminated.\nIX. Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets\nAll directors, corporate auditors, officers, and employees should promote and ensure\nthe efficient and responsible use of the Company’s assets and resources by the Company. Theft,\ncarelessness and waste have a direct impact on the Company’s profitability. Any suspected\nincidents of fraud or theft should be immediately reported for investigation.\nCompany assets, such as proprietary information, funds, materials, supplies, products,\nequipment, software, facilities, and other assets owned or leased by the Company or that are\notherwise in the Company’s possession, may only be used for legitimate business purposes and\nmust never be used for illegal purposes.\nProprietary information includes any information that is not generally known to the\npublic or would be valued by, or helpful to, our competitors. Examples of proprietary\ninformation are intellectual property, business and marketing plans, employee information, and\ncustomer/client lists. The obligation to use proprietary information only for legitimate business\npurposes continues even after you leave the Company.\nX. Insider Trading, Hedging and Pledging\nInsider trading is unethical and illegal. Directors, corporate auditors, officers, and\nemployees must not trade in securities of a company (including our suppliers, customers,\npartners, and other third parties with which we have relationships) while in possession of\nmaterial non-public information regarding that company. It is also illegal to “tip” or pass on\ninside information to any other person who might make an investment decision based on that\ninformation or pass the information to third parties. The Company has an Insider Trading\nPolicy, which describes these obligations in more detail and sets forth obligations in respect of\ntrading in, hedging and pledging the Company’s securities. For more information regarding\ntrading in, hedging and pledging the Company’s securities, please review the Company’s\nInsider Trading Policy.\nXI. Fair Dealing\nEach director, corporate auditor, officer, and employee, in carrying out his or her duties\nand responsibilities, should endeavor to deal fairly with each other and the Company’s\ncustomers, clients, suppliers, and competitors. No director, corporate auditor, officer, or\nemployee should take unfair advantage of anyone through illegal conduct, manipulation,\nconcealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts or any other\nunfair-dealing practice.\nXII. Non-Discrimination, and Non-Harassment\nWe are committed to providing a work environment free from discrimination and\nharassment based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, age, national origin or any other protected\n-5-\nclass. Such conduct is unlawful and prohibited by Company policy. Such prohibited conduct\nby or towards any employee, leader, contract worker, customer, client, vendor or anyone else\nwho does business with the Company will not be tolerated. Questions about compliance should\nbe addressed to the Company’s administrative division or internal audit division.\nAny employee determined by the Company to have engaged in conduct in violation of\nthis policy will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to, and including termination.\nMoreover, any employee or leader who condones or ignores potential violations of this policy\nwill be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Individuals\nshould also be aware that they can be held personally liable for engaging in unlawful\ndiscrimination, sexual or other harassment, or retaliation, and may be subject to civil or\ncriminal penalties. To the extent a customer, client, vendor, or other person with whom the\nCompany does business engages in conduct in violation of this policy, the Company will take\nappropriate corrective action.\nXIII. Safety and Health\nThe Company is committed to keeping its workplaces free from hazards. You should\nreport any accidents, injuries or unsafe equipment, practices or conditions immediately to a\nsupervisor or other designated person. Threats or acts of violence or physical intimidation are\nprohibited and should also be reported immediately. When representing and/or conducting\nbusiness for the Company, you must not be under the influence of and/or engage in the use of\nany substance that could prevent you from discharging your work duties and responsibilities\nsafely and effectively.\nXIV. Company Records and Document Retention\nRecords created, received or used during the conduct of Company business, including\nall communications sent or received using the Company’s email and/or other messaging\nsystems, are at all times the property of the Company wherever those records may be located.\nAt any time, the Company and, in certain circumstances, third parties (including government\nofficials), may review, without prior notice to personnel, any and all Company records,\nincluding records marked “Personal” or “Private.” All Company records should be\nstored/archived and retained in accordance with the Company’s record retention policy as in\neffect from time to time.\nAny records that you create and store are subject to this Code and may be demanded\nby third parties during the course of litigation or a government investigation or, in the case of\nrecords sent outside the Company, subject to the records retention policies of the recipients.\nYou should, therefore, avoid discriminatory remarks, harassment and threats of\nviolence or similar inappropriate or unlawful conduct. This applies to communications of all\nkinds, including e-mail, instant messaging, voicemail messages, text messages, video\nrecordings and informal notes or interoffice memos.\nXV. Use of Electronic Media\nThe Company has developed a policy to ensure that you understand the rules governing\n-6-\nyour use of the Company’s computer network, and options for e-mail and voicemail or other\nmessaging services, Internet access or other use of electronic media. All Company equipment,\nincluding desks, computers and computer systems, computer software, electronic storage\ndevices, cellphones or other mobile devices, e-mail, voicemail and other physical items are for\nbusiness use only. The Company at all times retains the right to access and search all such\nelectronic media or other items contained in or used in conjunction with the Company’s\ncomputer, e-mail, voicemail and Internet access systems and equipment with no prior notice.\nLike the Company’s computer network, e-mail and voicemail services, access to\nInternet services such as web-browsing or newsgroups is provided to employees by the\nCompany only for business use. Any personal use must be infrequent and must not involve any\nprohibited and/or unlawful activity, interfere with the productivity of the employee or his or\nher co-workers, consume system resources or storage capacity on an ongoing basis or involve\nlarge file transfers or otherwise deplete system resources available for business purposes.\nYour messages and computer information are considered Company property and\nconsequently, employees should not have an expectation of privacy in the context of computer,\ncellphone, and/or other mobile device use. Unless prohibited by law, the Company reserves the\nright to access and disclose this information as necessary for business purposes, in its sole\ndiscretion. Use good judgment, and do not access, send messages or store any information that\nyou would not want to be seen or heard by other individuals.\nThe Company also recognizes that many employees are choosing to express themselves\nby using Internet technologies, such as blogs, wikis, file-sharing, user generated audio and\nvideo, virtual worlds, and social networking sites, such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter.\nWhether you choose to participate in such social networking outside of work on your own time\nis your own decision.\nXVI. Business Gifts and Entertainment\nConflicts of interest generally arise when we offer or receive things of value to/from a\nthird party. Things of value may include gifts, gratuities, entertainment, tickets, loans, favors,\ndiscounts, travel, services, incentives, advances and items that would not be considered\n“normal business practice.” This rule of thumb applies to your immediate family members, as\nwell. A family member is a spouse, domestic partner, parent, or child of an employee at the\nCompany. Offering or receiving things of value that might be perceived to unfairly influence\na business relationship should be avoided. These guidelines apply at all times, and do not\nchange during traditional gift-giving seasons, and apply equally to employees, officers,\ncorporate auditors or directors offering gifts and entertainment to the Company’s business\nassociates.\nThis being said, at times you may receive nominal gifts that are generally common\nbusiness courtesies, such as an occasional lunch or dinner, or gifts of limited value. The value\nof gifts should be nominal, both with respect to frequency and monetary amount. Frequent\ngifting to a recipient may be perceived as an attempt to create an obligation to the giver and is\ntherefore inappropriate.\nIn addition, strict rules apply when the Company does business with governmental\n-7-\nagencies and officials, whether in Japan or in other countries. Because of the sensitive nature\nof these relationships, you must seek approval from the Company’s administrative division\nbefore offering or making any gifts or hospitality to governmental officials. Your judgement is\ncritical in these situations.\nXVII. Bribery, Corruption and Money Laundering\nDirectors, corporate auditors, officers, and employees must comply with all laws\nprohibiting bribery, corruption and kickbacks, including laws prohibiting improper payments\nto domestic and foreign officials such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”).\nWhile this section focuses primarily on foreign officials, this Policy equally prohibits bribery\nof domestic officials and commercial or private sector parties.\nThe FCPA prohibits an offer, payment, promise of payment or authorization of the\npayment of any money or thing of value to a foreign official, foreign political party, official of\na foreign political party or candidate for political office to induce or influence any act or\ndecision of such person or party or to secure any improper advantage. The FCPA prohibits\nsuch conduct whether done directly or indirectly through an agent or other intermediary.\nNo payment may be made to a foreign official even for non-discretionary action without\nfirst consulting with and obtaining written authorization from the Company’s administrative\ndivision. If a permitted facilitating payment is authorized, such payment must be accurately\nand fairly recorded in the Company’s books, records and accounts.\nThe FCPA further requires compliance by the Company with record keeping and\ninternal controls requirements. The Company must maintain financial records which, in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and disposition of corporate assets.\nIn particular, all bank accounts that receive or disburse funds on behalf of the Company shall\nbe properly authorized and any such transactions recorded on the official books and records of\nthe Company. In addition, the Company must maintain a system of internal controls sufficient\nto provide reasonable assurances that the Company’s assets are used only in accordance with\ndirectives and authorizations by the Board of Directors and senior management, and that checks\nand balances are employed so as to prevent the by-passing or overriding of these controls.\nViolation of the FCPA is an offense, subjecting the Company to substantial fines and\npenalties and any director, corporate auditor, officer, employee or stockholder acting on behalf\nof the Company to imprisonment and fines. The FCPA prohibits the Company from paying,\ndirectly or indirectly, a fine imposed upon an individual pursuant to the FCPA. Violation of\nthis policy may result in disciplinary actions up to and including discharge from the Company.\nIn addition, directors, corporate auditors, officers and employees of the Company must\ncomply with all applicable laws prohibiting money laundering. You may contact the\nCompany’s administrative division for information and questions related to anti-money\nlaundering laws and obligations.\nXVIII. Compliance with and Amendments to this Code\nFailure to comply with this Code or applicable laws, rules or regulations may result in\n-8-\ndisciplinary measures, including discharge from your position with the Company. Violations\nof this Code may also constitute violations of law and may result in civil or criminal penalties\nfor such person, such person’s supervisors and/or the Company. The Board of Directors will\ndetermine, or designate appropriate persons to determine, appropriate actions to be taken in the\nevent of a violation of this Code in relation to executives, directors or corporate auditors. In\ndetermining what action is appropriate in a particular case, the Board of Directors or its\ndesignee will consider the nature and severity of the violation, whether the violation was a\nsingle occurrence or repeated occurrences, whether the violation was intentional or inadvertent,\nwhether the individual in question had been advised prior to the violation as to the proper\ncourse of action and whether or not the individual in question had committed other violations\nin the past.\nThis Code cannot, and is not intended to, address all of the ethical complexities that\nmay arise during the course of employment or association with the Company. There will be\noccasions where circumstances not covered by policy or procedure arise, and where a judgment\nmust be made as to the appropriate course of action. In such circumstances, the Company\nencourages common sense decision-making, and consultation with a supervisor, the\nadministrative division, or a designee of them for guidance.\nAny material amendment of this Code will be made only by the Board of Directors and\nwill be promptly disclosed as required by law or stock exchange regulation.\nXIX. See Something, Say Something\nIf you suspect or observe any irregularities relating to accounting, accounting internal\ncontrols, or auditing matters or, if you think that an actual or possible violation of this Code or\nother policies or other unlawful or improper workplace conduct has occurred, it is important to\nreport your concerns immediately. You should use the channel that is most comfortable to you.\nAs a general matter, your supervisor or manager may be in the best position to address an issue.\nHowever, that is not your only option. Potential channels to report a concern are:\n• Your Manager;\n• Administrative Division;\n• Internal Audit Division; and\n• Corporate Auditor\nWe also have in place a whistleblowing contact and consultation contact pursuant to\n“Rule on Whistleblowing System” where reports or consultation can be made at any time by\nchat, phone, e-mail, facsimile, document, or direct meeting.\nThe Company strives to ensure that all questions or concerns are handled fairly,\ndiscreetly and thoroughly.\nOnce a report is made and received, the Company will investigate promptly and all\ndirectors, corporate auditors, officers, and employees are expected to cooperate candidly with\nrelevant investigatory procedures. Appropriate remedial action may be taken, based on the\noutcome of such investigation.\n-9-\nThe Company has a no-tolerance policy for retaliation against persons who raise good\nfaith compliance, ethics or related issues. However, it is unacceptable to file a report knowing\nit to be false.\nFor more information regarding reporting concerns of possible violation and\nmisconduct, please review the Company’s Rule on Whistleblowing System.\nXX. Disciplinary Action\nAnyone who violates this Code is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including\ntermination of employment.\nXXI. Waiver\nAny waiver of this Code for any executive officer or director will be made only by the\nBoard of Directors and will be promptly disclosed as required by law or stock exchange\nregulation. Any waiver of this Code for any other employee will be made by the Company’s\nBoard of Directors [or a designee of the Board of Directors].\nXXII. Acknowledgement\nYou will be provided with the Code when you first join the Company. Updates will be\nposted from time to time on our website and you are responsible for ensuring compliance with\nthe most recent version of the Code. You may also be required to acknowledge receipt and\ncompliance with the Code on an annual basis, which may be conducted electronically.\nEffective as of April 12, 2022\n-10-"

For that\nreason, there are some rules you’ll need to know and follow so that you don’t accidentally commit\ninsider trading, which is both a civil wrong and a crime in the United States that carries serious\nlegal penalties, including potentially millions of dollars in fines or jail time of up to 20 years.\nInsider trading also can result in the termination of your employment with the Company.\nピクシーダストテクノロジーズ株式会社又はその子会社（以下、「発行会社」といいます。）\nの従業員、請負業者、監査役、執行役員または取締役等が、会社に関する重要な非公開情報（以下、\n「MNPI」といいます。）を保有しながら、発行会社の有価証券を取引することは違法です。インサ\nイダー取引は、米国では民事上の違法行為であると同時に犯罪でもあり、数百万ドルの罰金や 20年\n以下の懲役を含む重大な法的処罰の対象となりますので、これらの者は偶発的にもインサイダー取\n引に抵触することのないように、関連諸規程を熟知しこれを遵守する必要があります。また、イン\nサイダー取引規制に抵触した場合、当社での雇用が停止されることもあります。\nInsider trading happens when someone with knowledge of MNPI about the Company uses\nthat MNPI, or tips off someone else to use the MNPI, to gain profits or avoid losses in the stock\nmarket. Because we are committed to upholding high standards of honest and ethical business\nconduct, we have adopted this Insider Trading Policy (this “Policy”) to take an active role in\npreventing insider trading violations.\nインサイダー取引とは、当社に関する MNPIを知っている者が、株式市場で利益を得るため、\nあるいは損失を回避するために、その MNPI を利用し、または、他の者に MNPI を利用させるため\nに情報を漏洩することをいいます。当社は、誠実で倫理的なビジネス行動を高い基準において遵守\nすることを宣言しているので、インサイダー取引規制に違反することを防ぐ上で積極的な役割を果\nたすために、このインサイダー取引管理ポリシー（以下、本ポリシー）を採用することといたしま\nした。\nIf you are considering trading our shares, please keep these three key points in mind:\n当社有価証券の売買を検討される方は、以下の3つのポイントを押さえてください。\n1. Never buy or sell our shares based on MNPI;\n1\nエラー! プロパティ名に誤りがあります。\nMNPIに基づいて当社の株式を売買を行ってはならないこと。\n2. Keep all MNPI confidential, including from your family and friends; and\n家族や友人を含め、すべての者に対してMNPIを漏洩してはならないこと。\n3. When in doubt about whether you have MNPI, ask before trading or transacting in\nany of our securities.\nMNPI を持っているかどうか疑わしい場合は、当社の有価証券を売買する前に照会を行うこ\nと。\nWe trust our employees, contractors, corporate auditors, officers and directors, and write\nour policies with that trust in mind. You are responsible for understanding and following this\nPolicy and for the consequences of any actions you may take. Our Chief Financial Officer and his\nor her designee (“Trading Compliance Officer”) will assist with implementing, interpreting and\nenforcing this Policy, pre-clearing trading activities of certain people and pre-approving any Rule\n10b5-1 Plans (plans that permit insiders to sell the Company’s shares on a pre-determined schedule\nthat the insider doesn’t control, discussed more fully later in this Policy).\n当社は、当社の従業員、請負業者、監査役、執行役員及び取締役を信頼しており、その信頼\nを念頭に置いてポリシーを作成しています。あなたは、このポリシーを理解し、それに従うこと、\n及びあなたが取る可能性のあるあらゆる行動の結果について責任を負います。当社の最高財務責任\n者及びその指名する者（以下、「取引コンプライアンス・オフィサー」といいます。）は、本ポリ\nシーの執行、解釈、適用、特定の者の売買の事前承認、及びルール 10b5-1 プラン（発行会社の株式\nを、内部者が管理することのできない、事前に決められたスケジュールで売却することを内部者に\n認めるプランで、本ポリシーで詳細は後述します。）の事前承認を支援します。\nPERSONS COVERED BY THIS POLICY 本方針の対象者\nThis Policy applies to our employees, contractors, corporate auditors, officers and directors,\nas well as to their (a) immediate family members and people sharing their households and (b)\nentities subject to their control such as corporations or other business entities controlled or\nmanaged by any such person, and trusts or other entities for which any such person is the trustee\nor in which any such person has a beneficial pecuniary interest (“Controlled Entities”). We will\nrefer to all of these individuals and entities in this Policy collectively as “Insiders.”\n本ポリシーは、当社の従業員、請負業者、監査役、執行役員または取締役、及びその(a)近親\n者及びその世帯員、(b)そのような者が支配又は管理する法人その他の事業体、そのような者が受託\n者となっている、又はそのような者が受益的な金銭的利益を有する信託その他の事業体など、その\n支配下にある事業体（以下、総称して「被支配者」といいます。）に適用されます。本ポリシーで\nは、これらの個人及び事業体を総称して「内部者」と呼びます。\nAll Insiders must get pre-approval of any trades in our securities.\nすべての内部者は、当社有価証券のいかなる取引についても事前承認を得なければなりませ\nん。\n2\nIf you are aware of MNPI when your employment or service relationship ends, you still\nmay not trade our shares until that MNPI has become public or is no longer material.\n雇用又はサービス関係が終了した時点で MNPIを知っていた場合、その MNPIが公表される\nか、又は重要でなくなるまで当社の株式を取引することはできません。\nWHAT THIS POLICY COVERS このポリシーの内容\nThe primary purpose of this Policy is to prevent people with MNPI from profiting from\nthat MNPI before it is made publicly available, thus allowing all of our stockholders to benefit\nfrom the information at the same time. More specifically, federal securities laws prohibit a person\nfrom using MNPI to make decisions about trading our shares, including tipping off someone else\nwith that information so that they can trade our shares.\nこのポリシーの主な目的は、MNPI を持っている人が、その MNPI が公開される前に利益を\n得ることを防ぎ、その結果、当社のすべての有価証券保有者が同時にその情報から利益を得ること\nができるようにすることです。具体的には、連邦証券法は、当社の有価証券を取引する際に MNPI\nを使って意思決定をすること、他の者に当社有価証券を取引させるために MNPI を漏洩させること\nを禁じています。\n“Material information” is information about the Company, positive or negative, that a\nreasonable investor would consider useful when buying or selling our shares. Some examples of\nMNPI include not-yet-announced financial or company performance information (especially cash\nbalance, burn and runway), significant regulatory communications, timing and achievement of\nmajor development milestones, results of studies and trials, entry into a new commercial agreement\nor termination of an existing commercial agreement, mergers or acquisitions, important pipeline\nexpansion, significant cybersecurity incidents or data breaches and changes in senior executive\nmanagement or our Board of Directors.\n\"重要な情報 \"とは、ポジティブであるかネガティブであるかにかかわらず、合理的な投資家\nが当社の株式を売買する際に有用であると考える発行会社に関する情報のことです。MNPI の例と\nしては、まだ発表されていない財務情報や業績情報（特に現預金残高、キャッシュバーン、ランウ\nェイ）、規制当局による重要な制裁、主要な開発マイルストーンの達成事実とその時期、研究と試\n験の結果、新しい商業契約の締結又は既存の商業契約の終了、合併又は買収、重要なパイプライン\nの拡大、重大なサイバーセキュリティインシデント又は情報漏洩、上級管理職や取締役会の構成員\nの変更などがあります。\n“Nonpublic” means that the confidential information has not yet been shared broadly\noutside of the Company. Please remember as well that we may possess confidential information\nrelating to or belonging to our collaborators, partners, customers or other third parties, and that it\nis equally important that we treat this information with the same care with which we treat our own\ninformation. If you are not sure whether information is considered public, you should either consult\nwith our Trading Compliance Officer or assume that the information is nonpublic and treat it as\nconfidential.\n「非公開」とは、その非公開情報がまだ社外で広く共有されていないことを意味します。当\n社の協力者、パートナー、顧客、その他の第三者に関する非公開情報を保有している可能性があり、\n3\n当社が自分の情報を扱うのと同様の注意を払ってこれらの情報を扱うことが同様に重要であること\nも覚えておく必要があります。情報が公開されているかどうかわからない場合は、当社の取引コン\nプライアンス・オフィサーに相談するか、その情報が非公開であると仮定して、それを機密情報と\nして取り扱うべきです。\nThis Policy applies to all transactions involving our securities (also referred to herein as\nour “shares”), including common shares (including common shares represented by American\nDepositary Shares), options and any other securities that the Company may issue, such as preferred\nstock, notes, bonds and convertible securities, as well as to derivative securities relating to any of\nthe Company’s securities, whether or not issued by the Company.\n本ポリシーは、普通株式（ADR を含みます。）、オプション、優先株式、ノート、債券、\n転換証券など、当社が発行するあらゆる有価証券を含む当社の有価証券（以下、「株式等」といい\nます）に関わるすべての取引に適用されます。また、当社が発行するか否かにかかわらず、当社の\n有価証券に関連するデリバティブ証券にも適用されます。\nPROHIBITED ACTIVITIES 禁止事項\nThis is a list of activities prohibited under this Policy based on specific relationships with\nthe Company:\nこれは、当社との具体的な関係に基づいて、本ポリシーで禁止されている活動のリストです。\nINSIDER:\n• Trade our shares, or make a gift, charitable contribution or other transfer with or\nwithout consideration of our shares while in possession of any MNPI.\nMNPIを保有している状態で、当社の株式を売買し、当社の株式を有償・無償にかか\nわらず、贈与、慈善寄付、その他の譲渡をすること。\n• Trade our shares during any period outside of our Trading Window or during any\nBlackout Period designated by our Chief Financial Officer or Trading Compliance\nOfficer.

We’ve provided some guidelines below to help you plan your trading in a way\nthat is consistent with this Policy and the law.\nMNPI を保有している場合、当社の株式をいつ取引するかを計画する際に、特別な注意を払\nう必要があります。当社は、本方針及び法律に沿った方法で取引を計画するためのガイドラインを\n以下に示します。\nTRADING WINDOWS AND BLACKOUT PERIODS トレーディングウィンドウとブ\nラックアウト期間\n• Trading Windows. Both our existing stockholders and potential new investors in\nour shares need time to absorb our external statements before the information in\nthose statements will be considered “public.” For that reason, we have implemented\nwindows of time when you can trade our shares without violating this Policy. All\nInsiders are allowed to trade our shares only during the Trading Window period,\nwhich opens after the close of trading on the next full trading day following the\nwidespread public release of our interim or year-end operating results, and closes\nat the close of trading on the fifteenth day before the end of the then-current\nfinancial period. For example, if we publicly announce our interim results after\nclose of trading on a Monday (or before trading begins on a Tuesday), then the first\ntime an Insider can trade our securities is after the close of market on Tuesday\n(effectively at the opening of the market on Wednesday for regular trading).\nHowever, if we announce interim financial results after trading begins on that\nTuesday, then the first time the Insider can trade is after the close of market on\nWednesday (effectively at the opening of the market on Thursday for regular\ntrading).\n取引可能期間 当社の既存の株主及び当社株式への潜在的な新規投資家は、当社の\n開示文書に記載された情報が「公開」されたとみなされるまでに、その情報を吸収\nする時間が必要です。そのため、当社では、本ポリシーに違反することなく当社株\n7\n式を取引できる期間を設けています。すべての内部者は、当社の半期又は通期の業\n績が広く公表された後の次の終日の取引日の取引終了後に開始され、次の会計期末\nよりの 15 日前の日の取引終了時に終了する取引可能期間中にのみ、当社の株式を取\n引することができます。例えば、当社が月曜日の取引終了後（又は火曜日の取引開\n始前）に半期業績を公表した場合、内部者が当社の有価証券を最初に取引できるの\nは火曜日の市場終了後（事実上、水曜日の通常取引の市場開始時）となります。た\nだし、火曜日の取引開始後に当社が半期決算を発表した場合、インサイダーが最初\nに取引できるのは水曜日の市場終了後（事実上、木曜日の通常取引の市場開始時）\nとなります。\n• No Trading During Trading Windows While in the Possession of MNPI. Even if a\nTrading Window that would allow you to trade our shares is open, you still may\nnot trade our shares if you possess MNPI at that time. An Insider who knows MNPI\nduring an open Trading Window may trade our shares only after the close of trading\non the next full trading day following our widespread public release of that MNPI.\nMNPIを保有している間は、取引可能期間内でも取引はできません。当社の有価証券\nを取引できる取引ウィンドウが開いていても、その時点で MNPI を持っている場合\nは、当社の株式を取引することはできません。取引可能期間中に MNPI を保有して\nいるインサイダーは、その MNPI が広く公開された次の終日の取引日の取引終了後\nにのみ、当社の有価証券を取引することができます。\n• No Trading During Blackout Periods. Even if a Trading Window is open, our Chief\nFinancial Officer or Trading Compliance Officer, at his or her discretion, may\ndesignate special trading Blackout Periods that apply to specific individuals or\ngroups of people (which may include all Insiders) for as long as our such officer\ndetermines. No Insider may trade our shares during any such Blackout Period.\nAdditionally, no Insider may tell anyone that a special Blackout Period has been\ndesignated or that one previously was in place, because that also is confidential\ninformation that cannot be disclosed internally or externally.\nブラックアウト期間中の取引禁止： 取引可能期間であっても、当社の最高財務責任\n者又は取引コンプライアンス・オフィサーは、その裁量により、特定の個人又はグ\nループ（すべての内部者を含む場合もあります）に適用される特別な取引禁止期間\nを指定することができます。いかなる内部者も、そのようなブラックアウト期間中\nに当社の株式を取引することはできません。さらに、特別な取引禁止期間が指定さ\nれたこと、あるいは以前に指定されていたことを、内部者が誰かに伝達することは\nできません。これもまた、社内外に開示できない非公開情報だからです。\nTRADING WINDOW EXCEPTION AUTHORIZATION トレーディングウィンドウの例\n外許可\n• The Company can allow Insiders to trade their ADRs until the cessation of ADR\ntrading planned to be on November 14th, 2024. This exception is a one-time\n8\nexception to the Trading Window provisions of the Policy. All other provisions of\nthe Policy remain in effect. This exception is subject to the following conditions:\n1. Public Announcement Requirement: This exception is effective only after the\nofficial public announcement regarding the termination of the ADR program and\nthe cessation of trading.\n2. Trading Window: Insiders may trade their ADRs until November 14th, 2024, after\nwhich ADR trading will cease.\n3. Reporting obligation: All trades executed under this exception must be properly\ndocumented and disclosed to our Chief Financial Officer or Trading Compliance\nOfficer in accordance with the manner specified therein for record-keeping\npurposes.\nPERMITTED TRADES UNDER 10B5-1 PLANS 10b5-1プランで許可される取引\nA 10b5-1 Plan is a plan written in advance that allows an Insider with MNPI to trade a\npredetermined number of shares at a predetermined time based on terms put in place before the\nInsider had any MNPI. These trades occur in accordance with the 10b5-1 Plan and without any\naction or influence by the Insider, such that the Insider is not able to subsequently influence the\ndetermination of when, how or whether to purchase shares. The 10b5-1 Plan must also certify that\nthe 10b5-1 Plan was entered into in good faith. The Company encourages the establishment of\n10b5-1 Plans; however, an Insider may not have more than one 10b5-1 Plan effective at any time,\nsubject to a few narrow exceptions. If you are interested in setting up a 10b5-1 Plan, you should\nconsult with our Chief Financial Officer or Trading Compliance Officer and make sure that any\n10b5-1 Plan is compliant with these rules.\n10b5-1 プランとは、MNPI を持つ内部者が、その内部者が MNPI を持つ前に設定された条件\nに基づいて、所定の時期に所定の数の株式を取引することを可能にする、事前に策定された計画の\nことです。これらの取引は、10b5-1 プランに従って行われ、内部者の行動や影響を受けることなく\n行われます。従って、内部者はいつ、どのような手段で、有価証券を売買するかどうかについて、\n計画策定後に影響を与えることができないこととなります。また、10b5-1 プランは信義誠実の原則\nに則って策定されなければなりません。当社は、10b5-1 プランの設立を推奨しています。しかしな\nがら、内部者はごく限られた例外ケースを除き、有効な 10b5-1プランを同時に 1つしか利用するこ\nとはできません。10b5-1 プランの設定に興味がある場合は、当社の最高財務責任者又は取引コンプ\nライアンス・オフィサーに相談し、10b5-1 プランがこれらの規則と整合的であることを確認してく\nださい。\nChief Financial Officer or Trading Compliance Officer Notification and Approval: 最高財務責任\n者又は取引コンプライアンス・オフィサーに対する通知と承認\nAn Insider wishing to enter into a 10b5-1 Plan must notify such officer in writing of the\ndetails of the contract or plan and provide a copy of such plan to the officer. The 10b5-1\nPlan must be put in place during an open Trading Window and not during any regular or\nspecially declared Blackout Period.\n9\n10b5-1 プランの策定を希望する内部者は最高財務責任者又は取引コンプライアンス・オフィ\nサーに書面で、契約または計画の詳細を通知し、それらの契約または計画の写しを提出しな\nければなりません。10b5-1 プランは取引可能期間に執行される計画でなければならず、通常\nまたは特別に設定されたブラックアウト期間中に執行される計画であってはなりません。\nCertification: 証明\nAn officer, director, corporate auditor or employee wishing to enter into a Rule 10b5-1\ntrading plan must certify within the contract or plan AND to the Chief Financial Officer or\nTrading Compliance Officer, in writing, that at the time of entering into such contract or\nplan: (i) he or she is not in possession of material non-public information concerning the\nCompany; (ii) he or she adopted the plan in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme\nto evade the prohibitions of Rule 10b5-1 (iii) he or she has not entered into any other\ntransaction that would have the effect of hedging the purchase or sale of the securities that\nare the subject of the contract or plan; and (iv) the proposed trade does not violate the\ntrading restrictions of Section 16 of the 1934 Act, as applicable, or Rule 144 under the 1933\nAct.\n10b5-1 プランを策定しようとする執行役員、取締役、監査役または従業員は契約または計画\n内で、かつ最高財務責任者または取引コンプライアンス・オフィサーに対して、書面で当該\n契約または計画が発効する時点において、(i)発行会社にかかる MNPI を保有していないこと、\n(ii)信義誠実の原則に則り計画を策定しており、当該計画やスキームの一部または全部が\n10b5-1 にかかる規則の禁止事項を背信的に回避するものでないこと、(iii)当該契約または計\n画の対象となる有価証券の売買をヘッジする効果を持つ他のトランザクションを行うもので\nないこと、(iv) 10b5-1による取引が米国1934年証券法のSection 16または米国1933年証券法\nのRule 144に規定される取引制限に抵触するものではないことを証明しなければなりません。\nWaiting, or “Cooling-Off,” Period: 待機期間、クーリングオフ期間\nAn individual entering into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan will not be able to rely on the\naffirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1 unless trading under the plan will not commence until\nthe expiration of the applicable waiting, or “cooling-off,” period.\n10b5-1 プランを利用する個人は、当該プランに基づく取引が待機期間又はクーリングオフ期\n間が満了してから開始されるものでない限り、Rule 10b5-1の積極的抗弁（affirmative defense）\nを主張することはできません。\n（注）Affirmative defenseは、一定の要件を充足する結果（自身に不利な）法的効果が発生す\nる場合であっても、affirmative defense の要件の充足を立証できれば、当該不利な法的効果を\n妨げることができるというものです（affirmative defense の主張が認められる場合には防御が\n成功します）。インサイダー取引との関係では、10b5-1 プランを提出し、当該プランに従っ\nて行動することによって、プラン提出後に MNPIを取得したとしても、affirmative defenseを\n主張することができます。\nDirectors and Officers: 取締役または執行役員\nA director and officer may begin trading pursuant to such person’s 10b5-1 Plan\nafter the later of (i) ninety days after adoption of the 10b5-1 Plan, or (ii) two\n10\nbusiness days following the Company’s filing of a Form 20-F or 6-K that discloses\nthe Company’s financial results.\n10b5-1 プランに基づく取締役または執行役員による売買は、(i)10b5-1 プランの策定\nから90日後、(ii)発行会社の業績を開示する20-Fまたは6-Kの提出後2営業日後のい\nずれか遅い日以後に執行されるものでなければなりません。\nAll Other Insiders:他の内部者\nAll other Insiders, other than directors and officers, may begin trading pursuant to\nsuch person’s 10b5-1 Plan thirty days following the adoption of the 10b5-1 Plan.\n取締役または執行役員以外の内部者が策定した 10b5-1 プランによる売買は、10b5-1\nプランの策定後30日後以降に執行されるものでなければなりません。\nTermination and Amendment:10b5-1プランの終了または修正\nAny amendment or early termination of any approved 10b5-1 Plan must be submitted for\nauthorization and pre-clearance by the Chief Financial Officer or Trading Compliance Officer.\nAny amendment to the amount, price or timing of the purchase or sale of securities under a contract\nor plan is a termination of such contract or plan.\n承認された10b5-1プランを修正し、または早期終了させる場合には、最高財務責任者又は取\n引コンプライアンス・オフィサーによる決裁を仰ぎ事前承認を受けなければなりません。10b5-1 プ\nランに基づく有価証券の売買にかかる数量、価格、売買時期が変更された場合、当該 10b5-1 プラン\nは終了することとなります。\nCONSEQUENCES OF VIOLATING THIS POLICY このポリシーに違反した場合の結\n果\nWe may impose sanctions on anyone violating this Policy and may issue stop transfer\norders to our transfer agent to forestall any attempted trades that would violate this Policy.\nSanctions may include disciplinary action, including termination of your employment with the\nCompany.
