Furthermore, thanks to the continued successful execution of certain quality system improvement initiatives, NTIC was also able to achieve another year of significantly improved profitability. Our fiscal 2024 results continue to demonstrate the value we bring to our global customers, as well as our resilience amidst ongoing economic challenges,” said G. Patrick Lynch, President and CEO of NTIC.\n\n“Higher sales of ZERUST® oil and gas and Natur-Tec® products along with improved gross profits, contributed to a $5,983,000, or 21.5%, year-over-year increase in gross profit for fiscal 2024. This expanded gross profit allowed NTIC to offset a $2,167,000 reduction in joint venture operating income, primarily resulting from a one-time gain of nearly $2,000,000 last fiscal year tied to the liquidation of our former joint venture in China, as well as challenging market conditions, including higher energy prices and other regional economic pressures, that affected sales and profitability across various European joint ventures. We are actively focused on our European joint ventures and remain cautiously optimistic that demand and profitability in Europe will begin to improve in fiscal 2025,” Mr. Lynch continued.\n\n“As anticipated, ZERUST® oil and gas had a record-breaking fourth quarter, with revenues reaching $4,200,000. This was supported by approximately $600,000 in sales that shifted from the third quarter due to timing, as well as increased orders from both new and existing customers. While we expect seasonal ordering patterns to drive fluctuations in ZERUST® oil and gas sales, we are well-positioned for compelling growth in this sector through fiscal 2025 and beyond. Additionally, we believe global demand for our Natur-Tec® compostable plastic solutions will drive sustained revenue growth. Finally, the strategic investments we made in our workforce and infrastructure in fiscal 2024 are set to support growth opportunities across our global markets. While the economic environment remains fluid, we anticipate fiscal 2025 will bring further sales growth and improved profitability,” concluded Mr. Lynch.\n\nNTIC’s consolidated net sales increased 12.7% to $23,349,000 during the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to $20,710,000 for the three months ended August 31, 2023. The year-over-year increase in consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter was primarily a result of sales growth within the Company’s ZERUST® oil and gas and Natur-Tec® product categories and supported by higher customer demand. For the full year ended August 31, 2024, consolidated net sales increased 6.5% to $85,060,000, compared to $79,903,000 for the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of increased sales and demand for Natur-Tec® and, to a lesser extent, ZERUST® products.\n\nThe following tables set forth NTIC’s net sales by product category for the three months and fiscal year ended August 31, 2024, and August 31, 2023, by segment:\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**August 31,****2024**| **% of Net Sales**| **August 31,**2023****| **% of Net Sales**| **% Change**  \nZERUST® industrial net sales| $| 13,431,917| 57.5| %| $| 13,421,470| 64.8| %| 0.1| %  \nZERUST® oil & gas net sales| 4,199,583| 18.0| %| 2,377,472| 11.5| %| 76.6| %  \nTotal ZERUST® net sales| $| 17,631,500| 75.5| %| $| 15,798,942| 76.3| %| 11.6| %  \nTotal Natur-Tec® net sales| 5,717,607| 24.5| %| 4,910,693| 23.7| %| 16.4| %  \nTotal net sales| $| 23,349,107| 100.0| %| $| 20,709,635| 100.0| %| 12.7| %  \n**Fiscal Year Ended**  \n---  \n**August 31,****2024**| **% of NetSales**| **August 31,**2023****| **% of NetSales**| **%Change**  \nZERUST® industrial net sales| $| 53,863,296| 63.3| %| $| 53,926,378| 67.5| %| (0.1| )%  \nZERUST® oil & gas net sales| 9,229,279| 10.9| %| 7,801,986| 9.8| %| 18.3| %  \nTotal ZERUST® net sales| $| 63,092,575| 74.2| %| $| 61,728,364| 77.3| %| 2.2| %  \nTotal Natur-Tec® net sales| 21,966,942| 25.8| %| 18,174,588| 22.7| %| 20.9| %  \nTotal net sales| $| 85,059,517| 100.0| %| $| 79,902,952| 100.0| %| 6.5| %  \n  \nNTIC’s joint venture operating income decreased 51.4% to $2,034,000 during the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to joint venture operating income of $4,181,000 during the three months ended August 31, 2023. The $2,148,000 decrease in joint venture operating income was primarily due to a one-time $1,986,000 gain recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 associated with the liquidation of the Company’s former joint venture in China, as well as a decrease in net income at NTIC’s joint venture in Germany, partially offset by increases in income at other joint ventures. Net sales of NTIC’s joint ventures, which are not consolidated with NTIC’s financial results, decreased 3.6% to $23,297,000 during the three months ended August 31, 2024, compared to $24,157,000 for the three months ended August 31, 2023.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, NTIC’s joint venture operating income decreased $2,167,000 or 18.6% to $9,475,000, compared to joint venture operating income of $11,642,000 during the full year ended August 31, 2023. Net sales of NTIC’s joint ventures decreased 4.7% to $95,940,000 for the full year ended August 31, 2024, compared to $100,682,000 for the full year ended August 31, 2023.\n\nOperating expenses, as a percent of net sales, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 were 40.7%, compared to 44.8% for the same period last fiscal year. For the full fiscal year 2024, operating expenses, as a percent of net sales, were 41.6%, compared to 41.8% for the same period last fiscal year. Higher operating expenses for the three and twelve months ended August 31, 2024, over the prior fiscal year periods were primarily due to increased personnel expenses, including new hires, benefits and travel.\n\nNet income attributable to NTIC for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 increased to $1,836,000, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to net income of $939,000, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the same period last fiscal year. For the full year ended August 31, 2024, net income attributable to NTIC increased to $5,409,000, or $0.55 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2,912,000, or $0.30 per diluted share, for the same period last fiscal year.\n\nNTIC’s non-GAAP adjusted net income, as set forth in the GAAP reconciliation at the end of this release, was $1,942,000, or $0.20 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to $280,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the same quarter last fiscal year. For the full year ended August 31, 2024, NTIC’s non-GAAP adjusted net income, as set forth in the GAAP reconciliation at the end of this release, was $5,832,000, or $0.59 per diluted share, compared to $2,570,000, or $0.27 per diluted share last fiscal year.\n\nNTIC’s consolidated balance sheet remains strong, with working capital of $23,682,000 as of August 31, 2024, including $4,952,000 in cash and cash equivalents and an outstanding revolving line of credit and term loan balance of $7,112,000, compared to $22,950,000 of working capital as of August 31, 2023, including $5,406,000 in cash and cash equivalents and an outstanding revolving line of credit and term loan balance of $6,357,000.\n\nAt August 31, 2024, the Company had $25,397,000 of investments in joint ventures, of which $14,057,000 or 55.3%, is cash, with the remaining balance mostly made up of other working capital.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nNTIC will host a conference call today at 8:00 a.m. Central Time to review its results of operations for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year of 2024 and its outlook, followed by a question-and-answer session.

These non-GAAP financial measures are information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in the accompanying release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. NTIC uses non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures of performance and believes these measures facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by factoring out potential differences caused by non-recurring, unusual or infrequent charges not related to NTIC’s regular, ongoing business. NTIC also believes that the presentation of certain non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors in evaluating the company’s operations, period over period. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in the release.
