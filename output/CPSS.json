The partnership enables CPS to improve its fraud prevention efforts while also saving the Company approximately $1 million per quarter so far.\n\nSentiLink’s AI-driven technology analyzes key identity and fraud indicators to generate actionable reports for CPS, helping the Company lend to legitimate, verified borrowers. This improvement in fraud detection directly supports CPS’s goal of significantly reducing lifetime portfolio losses, ultimately reinforcing financial performance.\n\n“Fraud prevention is an increasingly vital component of our risk management strategy,” said Robert DeJarnette, VP of Risk Management at CPS. “With the rise in fraud attempts across the subprime auto sector, SentiLink’s technology will continue to be instrumental in helping us detect fraudulent activity early and reduce exposure within our portfolio.”\n\nMike Lavin, COO of CPS, added: “SentiLink’s fraud detection capabilities have already helped us lower our fraud exposure by over $1 million each quarter so far. As we continue to optimize our technology, we expect to further reduce risks for our lending partners while supporting our continued growth in the subprime lending market.”\n\nStaying at the forefront of technology has become a key performance differentiator for CPS, enabling the Company to refine its underwriting processes, enhance dealer performance, and strengthen risk management. Through the thoughtful application of advanced AI and machine learning, CPS is well-positioned to drive sustained growth in the years ahead.\n\n**About Consumer Portfolio Services:**Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. is an independent specialty finance company that provides indirect automobile financing to individuals with past credit problems or limited credit histories.

In each case, such figures are forward-looking statements because they are dependent on the Company’s estimates of losses to be incurred in the future. The accuracy of such estimates may be adversely affected by various factors, which include the following: possible increased delinquencies; repossessions and losses on retail installment contracts; incorrect prepayment speed and/or discount rate assumptions; possible unavailability of qualified personnel, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to service its portfolio; possible increases in the rate of consumer bankruptcy filings, which could adversely affect the Company’s rights to collect payments from its portfolio; other changes in government regulations affecting consumer credit; possible declines in the market price for used vehicles, which could adversely affect the Company’s realization upon repossessed vehicles; and economic conditions in geographic areas in which the Company's business is concentrated. Any or all of such factors also may affect the Company’s future financial results, as to which there can be no assurance. Any implication that the results of the most recently completed quarter are indicative of future results is disclaimed, and the reader should draw no such inference. Factors such as those identified above in relation to losses to be incurred in the future may affect future performance._\n\n**_Investor Relations Contact_**\n\nDanny Bharwani, Chief Financial Officer\n\n949-753-6811\n\n**Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries**  \n---  \n**Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations**  \n**(In thousands, except per share data)**  \n**(Unaudited)**  \nThree months ended | Nine months ended  \nSeptember 30, | September 30,  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \n**Revenues:**  \nInterest income | $ | 93,158 | $ | 83,261 | $ | 265,812 | $ | 245,960  \nMark to finance receivables measured at fair value | 5,500 | 6,000 | 16,000 | 6,000  \nOther income | 1,922 | 2,818 | 6,391 | 8,077  \n100,580 | 92,079 | 288,203 | 260,037  \n**Expenses:**  \nEmployee costs | 24,162 | 21,812 | 72,303 | 64,991  \nGeneral and administrative | 13,276 | 13,045 | 40,288 | 36,224  \nInterest | 50,056 | 37,889 | 138,735 | 106,354  \nProvision for credit losses | (994 | ) | (2,000 | ) | (4,579 | ) | (20,700 | )  \nOther expenses | 7,229 | 7,115 | 21,376 | 21,915  \n93,729 | 77,861 | 268,123 | 208,784  \nIncome before income taxes | 6,851 | 14,218 | 20,080 | 51,253  \nIncome tax expense | 2,055 | 3,839 | 6,022 | 13,097  \nNet income | $ | 4,796 | $ | 10,379 | $ | 14,058 | $ | 38,156  \nEarnings per share:  \nBasic | $ | 0.22 | $ | 0.49 | $ | 0.66 | $ | 1.83  \nDiluted | $ | 0.20 | $ | 0.41 | $ | 0.58 | $ | 1.51  \nNumber of shares used in computing earnings per share:  \nBasic | 21,343 | 21,154 | 21,250 | 20,815  \nDiluted | 24,153 | 25,218 | 24,340 | 25,331  \n**Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets**  \n**(In thousands)**  \n**(Unaudited)**  \nSeptember 30, | December 31,   \n2024 | 2023  \n**Assets:**  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 8,071 | $ | 6,174  \nRestricted cash and equivalents | 270,981 | 119,257  \nFinance receivables measured at fair value | 3,132,310 | 2,722,662  \nFinance receivables | 8,274 | 27,553  \nAllowance for finance credit losses | -486 | -2,869  \nFinance receivables, net | 7,788 | 24,684  \nDeferred tax assets, net | 1,565 | 3,736  \nOther assets | 41,977 | 27,233  \n$ | 3,462,692 | $ | 2,903,746  \n**Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity:**  \nAccounts payable and accrued expenses | $ | 72,626 | $ | 62,544  \nWarehouse lines of credit | 105,783 | 234,025  \nResidual interest financing | 99,127 | 49,875  \nSecuritization trust debt | 2,875,777 | 2,265,446  \nSubordinated renewable notes | 24,288 | 17,188  \n3,177,601 | 2,629,078  \nShareholders' equity | 285,091 | 274,668  \n$ | 3,462,692 | $ | 2,903,746  \nOperating and Performance Data ($ in millions)  \nAt and for the | At and for the  \nThree months ended | Nine months ended  \nSeptember 30, | September 30,  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nContracts purchased | $ | 445.95 | $ | 322.42 | $ | 1,224.13 | $ | 1,055.96  \nContracts securitized | $ | 298.42 | $ | 312.68 | 1,256.13 | 1,045.42  \nTotal portfolio balance (1) | $ | 3,329.84 | $ | 2,943.33 | $ | 3,329.84 | $ | 2,943.33  \nAverage portfolio balance (1) | $ | 3,278.34 | $ | 2,934.75 | 3,131.48 | 2,898.44  \nDelinquencies (1)  \n31+ Days | 11.25 | % | 11.74 | %  \nRepossession Inventory | 2.79 | % | 1.57 | %  \nTotal Delinquencies and Repo.

This advanced AI-driven solution enhances the dealer experience by automatically verifying stipulations, improving capture rates, and reducing contracts-in-transit.\n\nCPS has consistently focused on leveraging technology to enhance its operations across the subprime auto lending cycle. For years, CPS has utilized AI and machine learning to streamline its underwriting processes, improve risk management, and optimize dealer performance. The Company’s proprietary AI-driven models have enabled the approval of higher-quality loans, resulting in better credit performance, enhanced collections, and stronger portfolio growth.\n\nWith the integration of Dealer Verify, CPS is further expanding its use of AI to improve dealer efficiency. By automating the collection and real-time verification of key consumer stipulations—such as proof of income, bank account statements, and other necessary documents—Dealer Verify enables CPS dealers to process loans more quickly and accurately, reducing delays, minimizing fraud risk, and enhancing customer satisfaction.\n\nDealer Verify processes various document types and data sources, automating calculations, identifying omissions, and flagging potential fraud to ensure accurate decisions in real time. When dealers submit documents through CPS’s secure Dealer Verify portal, they receive immediate feedback, eliminating concerns about non-conforming stipulations or image quality issues. This allows any issues to be resolved quickly, ensuring all documents are verified quickly and ready before customers leave the dealership.\n\n“By leveraging Dealer Verify, CPS dealers are now equipped with the tools to handle loan originations more efficiently,” said Mike Lavin, COO at Consumer Portfolio Services. “This technology allows us to provide a streamlined, frictionless experience to our dealers, ensuring deals are processed faster, with fewer errors, and with significantly less risk of contracts-in-transit.”\n\nTeri Robinson, Executive Vice President of Sales and Originations of Consumer Portfolio Services added, “By leveraging AI, we have cut days in house from over three to under two. We have increased our same day funding percentage by 100% and second-day funding percentage by 50%. We can ensure that every loan is processed with maximum accuracy, giving our dealers confidence in their decisions and allowing us to continue delivering competitive-rate loans to all market segments.”\n\nLooking ahead, CPS continues to expand its operations and invest in growth. With a growing network of over 12,000 approved dealerships across 47 states, CPS is scaling its team to support increasing demand, aiming to add more sales representatives by year-end. This expansion ensures CPS can continue to provide efficient, affordable financing options to more consumers while strengthening relationships with dealers nationwide.\n\n**About Consumer Portfolio Services:**Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. is an independent specialty finance company that provides indirect automobile financing to individuals with past credit problems or limited credit histories.
