(the “Bank”) announces its consolidated financial results for the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThe Company reported net loss of $16.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, or $0.59 diluted loss per share, compared to net income of $190 thousand, or $0.01 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2024, and $6.6 million, or $0.35 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n“As we previously reported, the merger of Southern California Bancorp and California BanCorp closed on July 31, 2024, and I am pleased to announce we executed a successful core conversion on September 20, 2024,” said David Rainer, Executive Chairman of the Company and the Bank. “We are excited to have created a commercial banking franchise with a footprint that covers the best banking markets in both Northern and Southern California and that is based on our trusted brands and reputations. Our scalable business model is expected to bring cost savings and greater efficiency to our operations, while allowing us to offer complementary products and services to all our clients. We will continue to build on our history of service to our communities and remain dedicated to increasing shareholder value.”\n\n“With the close of the merger and successful conversion behind us, we are now focused on the prudent growth of our franchise by offering the highest quality and level of customer service available to middle-market businesses in both Northern and Southern California,” said Steven Shelton, CEO of the Company and the Bank. “We are excited about our future and look forward to the traction we expect our combined banking franchise will realize in the coming quarters.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n●| **Merger closed** on July 31, 2024, whereby California BanCorp (“CALB”) merged with and into Southern California Bancorp and California Bank of Commerce merged with and into Bank of Southern California, N.A. CALB had total loans of $1.43 billion, total assets of $1.91 billion, and total deposits of $1.64 billion. The combined holding company has assumed the California BanCorp name, and the combined bank has assumed the California Bank of Commerce, N.A. name. The merger created a bank holding company with approximately $4.25 billion in assets and 14 branches across California, with approximately 300 employees serving our communities.  \n---|---  \n●| **Total aggregate consideration** paid was approximately $216.6 million and resulted in approximately $74.7 million of preliminary goodwill subject to adjustment in accordance with ASC 805.  \n●| **Net loss** of $16.5 million or $0.59 diluted loss per share for the third quarter reflects the after-tax one-time initial provision for credit losses (“day one provision”) related to non-purchased credit deteriorated (“non-PCD”) loans and unfunded loan commitments of $15.0 million and merger related expenses of $10.6 million; adjusted net income (non-GAAP1) was $9.1 million or $0.33 per share for the third quarter.  \n**●**| **Net interest margin** of 4.43%, compared with 3.94% in the prior quarter; average total loan yield of 6.79% compared with 6.21% in the prior quarter.  \n●| **Provision for credit losses** of $23.0 million for the third quarter, of which $21.3 million was due to the day one provision for credit losses on non-PCD loans and unfunded loan commitments.  \n  \n1 Reconciliations of non–U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) measures are set forth at the end of this press release.\n\n**●**| **Return on average assets** of (1.82)%, compared with 0.03% in the prior quarter.  \n---|---  \n●| **Return on average common equity** of (15.28)%, compared with 0.26% in the prior quarter.  \n**_●_**| **Efficiency ratio (non-GAAP****1****)** of 98.9% compared with 85.7% in the prior quarter; excluding merger related expenses the efficiency ratio was 60.5%, compared with 83.5% in the prior quarter.  \n●| **Tangible book value per common share (“TBV”) (non-GAAP****1****)** of $11.28 at September 30, 2024, down $2.43 from $13.71 at June 30, 2024.  \n**_●_**| **Total assets of** $4.36 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with $2.29 billion at June 30, 2024.  \n**_●_**| **Total loans, including loans held for sale** of $3.23 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with $1.88 billion at June 30, 2024, largely due to the merger, with the fair value of the acquired loans totaling $1.36 billion.  \n**_●_**| **Nonperforming assets to total assets ratio** of 0.68% at September 30, 2024, compared with 0.20% at June 30, 2024, which included the fair value of $13.9 million in nonaccrual PCD loans in connection with the merger.  \n**●**| **Allowance for credit losses (“ACL”)** was 1.80% of total loans held for investment at September 30, 2024; allowance for loan losses (“ALL”) was 1.67% of total loans held for investment at September 30, 2024.  \n**_●_**| **Total deposits** of $3.74 billion at September 30, 2024, increased $1.81 billion or 93.2% compared with $1.94 billion at June 30, 2024, largely due to the $1.64 billion of deposits acquired in the merger.  \n**_●_**| **Noninterest-bearing demand deposits** of $1.37 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $701.7 million or 105.3%, of which $635.5 million was related to the merger; noninterest bearing deposits represented 36.6% of total deposits, compared with $666.6 million, or 34.4% of total deposits at June 30, 2024.  \n●| **Cost of deposits** was 2.09%, compared with 2.12% in the prior quarter.  \n●| **Cost of funds** was 2.19%, compared with 2.21% in the prior quarter.  \n**_●_**| **The Company’s capital exceeds minimums required to be “well-capitalized** ,**”** the highest regulatory capital category.  \n  \n**Third Quarter Operating Results**\n\n**Net Loss**\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $16.5 million, or $0.59 loss per diluted share, compared with net income of $190 thousand, or $0.01 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2024. Our third quarter results were negatively impacted by a day one $15.0 million after-tax CECL-related provision for credit losses on non-PCD loans and unfunded loan commitments related to the merger, or $0.54 loss per diluted share, and $10.6 million of after-tax merger expenses, or $0.38 loss per diluted share. Excluding one-time CECL-related provision for credit losses on acquired loans and unfunded loan commitments, and merger related expenses, the Company would have reported net income (non-GAAP1) of $9.1 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024. Pre-tax, pre-provision income (non-GAAP1) for the third quarter was $436 thousand, a decrease of $2.7 million or 86.3% from the prior quarter.\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**\n\nNet interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $36.9 million, compared with $21.0 million in the prior quarter. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to a $22.3 million increase in total interest and dividend income, partially offset by a $6.3 million increase in total interest expense in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the prior quarter. During the third quarter of 2024, loan interest income increased $18.5 million, of which $4.1 million was related to accretion income from the net purchase accounting discounts on acquired loans, total debt securities income increased $458 thousand, and interest and dividend income from other financial institutions increased $3.3 million. The increase in interest income was primarily driven by the mix of interest-earning assets added by the merger and the impact of the accretion and amortization of fair value marks. Average total interest-earning assets increased $1.17 billion, the result of a $900.7 million increase in average total loans, a $114.2 million increase in average deposits in other financial institutions, a $25.1 million increase in average total debt securities, a $124.1 million increase in average Fed funds sold/resale agreements and a $7.5 million increase in average restricted stock investments and other bank stock. The increase in interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to a $6.0 million increase in interest expense on interest-bearing deposits, the result of a $763.7 million increase in average interest-bearing deposits, coupled with a $34.3 million increase in average subordinated debt, partially offset by a 6 basis point decrease in average interest-bearing deposit costs, and a $378 thousand decrease in interest expense on Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) borrowings, the result of a $26.8 million decrease in average FHLB borrowings in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nNet interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 4.43%, compared with 3.94% in the prior quarter. The increase was primarily related to a 52 basis point increase in the total interest-earning assets yield, coupled with a 2 basis point decrease in the cost of funds. The yield on total average earning assets in the third quarter of 2024 was 6.49%, compared with 5.97% in the prior quarter. The yield on average total loans in the third quarter of 2024 was 6.79%, an increase of 58 basis points from 6.21% in the prior quarter. Accretion income from the net purchase accounting discounts on acquired loans was $4.1 million and the amortization expense impact on interest expense was $283 thousand, which increased the net interest margin by 46 basis points in the third quarter of 2024. Accretion income from the net purchase accounting discounts on acquired loans was $4.1 million, which increased the yield on average total loans by 59 basis points in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nCost of funds for the third quarter of 2024 was 2.19%, a decrease of 2 basis points from 2.21% in the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by a 6 basis point decrease in the cost of average interest-bearing deposits, and an increase in average noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by an increase of 187 basis points in the cost of total borrowings, which was driven primarily by the amortization expense of $373 thousand, or 281 basis points from the purchase accounting discounts on acquired subordinated debts. Average noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased $373.8 million to $1.03 billion and represented 33.6% of total average deposits for the third quarter of 2024, compared with $658.0 million and 34.1%, respectively, in the prior quarter; average interest-bearing deposits increased $763.7 million to $2.04 billion during the third quarter of 2024. The total cost of deposits in the third quarter of 2024 was 2.09%, a decrease of 3 basis points from 2.12% in the prior quarter. The cost of total interest-bearing deposits decreased primarily due to the Company’s deposit repricing strategy and paying off high cost brokered deposits in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nAverage total borrowings increased $7.6 million to $52.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to an increase of $34.3 million in average subordinated debt from the $50.8 million in fair value of subordinated debt acquired in the merger, partially offset by a decrease of $26.8 million in average FHLB borrowings during the third quarter of 2024. The average cost of total borrowings was 7.71% for the third quarter of 2024, up from 5.84% in the prior quarter.\n\n**Provision for Credit Losses**\n\nThe Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $23.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $2.9 million in the prior quarter. The increase was largely related to the merger, and the resulting one-time initial provision for credit losses on acquired non-PCD loans of $18.5 million and unfunded commitments of $2.7 million. Total net charge-offs were $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, which included $967 thousand from a construction loan and $135 thousand from an acquired consumer solar loan portfolio. The provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2024 included a $3.3 million provision for unfunded loan commitments, of which $2.7 million was related to the one-time initial provision for credit losses on acquired unfunded loan commitments, and $511 thousand related to the increase in unfunded loan commitments during the third quarter of 2024, coupled with higher loss rates and average funding rates used to estimate the allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments. Total unfunded loan commitments increased $662.4 million to $1.03 billion at September 30, 2024, including $574.3 million in unfunded loan commitment related to the merger, compared to $371.5 million in unfunded loan commitments at June 30, 2024. The provision for credit losses for loans held for investment in the third quarter of 2024 was $19.7 million, an increase of $16.7 million from $3.0 million in the prior quarter. The increase was driven primarily by the one-time initial provision for credit losses on acquired non-PCD loans and increases in legacy special mention loans and loans held for investment. Additionally, qualitative factors, coupled with changes in the portfolio mix and in net charge-offs, and in the reasonable and supportable forecast, primarily related to the economic outlook for California which were partially offset by decreases in legacy substandard accruing loans, were factors related to the increase in the provision for credit losses. The Company’s management continues to monitor macroeconomic variables related to increasing interest rates, inflation and the concerns of an economic downturn, and believes it has appropriately provisioned for the current environment.\n\n**Noninterest Income**\n\nThe Company recorded noninterest income of $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of $5 thousand compared to $1.2 million in the second quarter of 2024. There was no gain on SBA 7A loan sales in the second and third quarters of 2024. Noninterest income was impacted by the merger through increases in service charges and fees on deposit accounts, bank owned life insurance income, and servicing and related income on loans; offset by a $614 thousand valuation allowance on other real estate owned (“OREO”) due to a decline in the fair value of the underlying property in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Noninterest Expense**\n\nTotal noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $37.7 million, an increase of $18.7 million from total noninterest expense of $19.0 million in the prior quarter, which was largely due to the increase in merger related expenses.\n\nSalaries and employee benefits increased $6.6 million during the quarter to $15.4 million. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily the result of the merger and included $1.4 million related to one-time costs associated with non-continuing directors, executives and employees. Merger and related expenses in connection with the merger increased $14.1 million to $14.6 million. These costs primarily included retention bonus, severance and change in control costs of $6.2 million, financial advisory fees of $2.3 million, information technology expenses of $4.5 million, insurance costs of $919 thousand and legal and other professional costs of $305 thousand. The increase in core deposit intangible amortization was primarily driven by $622 thousand related to the additional amortization from the core deposit intangible of $22.7 million acquired in the merger.\n\nThe Company sold other real estate owned and recognized a $4.8 million loss in the second quarter of 2024. There was no comparable transaction in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nEfficiency ratio (non-GAAP1) for the third quarter of 2024 was 98.9%, compared to 85.7% in the prior quarter. Excluding the merger and related expenses of $14.6 million, the efficiency ratio (non-GAAP1) for the third quarter of 2024 would have been 60.5%.\n\n**Income Tax**\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, the Company’s income tax benefit was $6.1 million, compared with an $88 thousand income tax expense in the second quarter of 2024. The effective rate was 26.9% for the third quarter of 2024 and 31.7% for the second quarter of 2024. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to the impact of the vesting and exercise of equity awards combined with changes in the Company’s stock price over time, as well as non-deductible merger-related expenses.\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\n**Assets**\n\nTotal assets at September 30, 2024 were $4.36 billion, an increase of $2.07 billion or 90.2% from June 30, 2024. The increase in total assets from the prior quarter was primarily related to the $1.86 billion in fair value of total assets acquired in the merger, which included increases of $1.36 billion in loans held for investment, $42.6 million in debt securities, and $336.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the Company recorded preliminary goodwill of $74.7 million related to the merger in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Loans**\n\nTotal loans held for investment were $3.20 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $1.32 billion, compared to June 30, 2024, primarily the result of the $1.36 billion fair value of loans acquired in the merger. During the third quarter 2024, there were new originations of $70.0 million and net advances of $8.9 million, offset by payoffs of $64.9 million, and the transfer of a multifamily nonaccrual loan of $4.7 million to OREO and the partial charge-off of loans in the amount of $1.2 million. Total loans secured by real estate increased by $814.5 million, including $780.9 million acquired in the merger, construction and land development loans increased by $42.9 million, commercial real estate and other loans increased by $712.2 million, 1-4 family residential loans decreased by $4.8 million and multifamily loans increased by $64.2 million. Commercial and industrial loans increased by $482.3 million, and consumer loans increased by $25.3 million, largely due to a $25.2 million increase in consumer loans related to the merger. The Company had $33.7 million in loans held for sale at September 30, 2024, compared to $7.0 million at June 30, 2024.\n\n**Deposits**\n\nTotal deposits at September 30, 2024 were $3.74 billion, an increase of $1.81 billion from June 30, 2024 due to the $1.64 billion in fair value of deposits related to the merger. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits at September 30, 2024, were $1.37 billion, including $635.5 million noninterest-bearing demand deposits related to the merger, or 36.6% of total deposits, compared with $666.6 million, or 34.4% of total deposits at June 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, total interest-bearing deposits were $2.37 billion, compared to $1.27 billion at June 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, total brokered time deposits were $222.6 million, including a $251.4 million increase of brokered time deposits related to the merger, compared to $103.4 million in brokered time deposits at June 30, 2024. The Company used excess cash acquired from the merger to pay off high cost callable and noncallable brokered time deposits totaling $131.9 million during the third quarter 2024. The Company also offers the Insured Cash Sweep (ICS) product, providing customers with FDIC insurance coverage at ICS network institutions. At September 30, 2024, ICS deposits were $699.6 million, or 18.7% of total deposits, compared to $239.8 million, or 12.4% of total deposits at June 30, 2024. Legacy CALB was also a participant in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS), and Reich & Tang Deposit Solutions (R&T) network, both of which provide reciprocal deposit placement services to fully qualified large customer deposits for FDIC insurance among other participating banks. At July 31, 2024, the Company acquired the fair value of $37.7 million in CDARS deposits and $306.6 million in R&T deposits.\n\n**Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) and Liquidity**\n\nThe Company repaid all FHLB borrowings with liquidity primarily derived from the cash acquired in the merger during the third quarter of 2024. At September 30, 2024, the Company had no overnight FHLB borrowings, a $25.0 million decrease from June 30, 2024. There were no outstanding Federal Reserve Discount Window borrowings at September 30, 2024 or June 30, 2024.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had available borrowing capacity from the FHLB secured line of credit of approximately $663.6 million and available borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve Discount Window of approximately $446.4 million. The Company also had available borrowing capacity from eight unsecured credit lines from correspondent banks of approximately $121.0 million at September 30, 2024, with no outstanding borrowings. Total available borrowing capacity was $1.23 billion at September 30, 2024. Additionally, the Company had unpledged liquid securities at fair value of approximately $159.3 million and cash and cash equivalents of $614.4 million at September 30, 2024.\n\nIn connection with the merger, the Company assumed subordinated borrowings of $55.0 million, with a fair value of $50.8 million. The subordinated borrowings include $20.0 million with a maturity date in September 2030 and $35.0 million with a maturity date in September 2031.\n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nTotal non-performing assets increased to $29.8 million, or 0.68% of total assets at September 30, 2024, compared with $4.7 million, or 0.20% of total assets at June 30, 2024.\n\nThe increase in non-performing assets in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to downgrades of a construction loan and 1-4 family residential loan from one relationship totaling $12.7 million and a $13.9 million of nonaccrual PCD loans acquired in the merger. This increase was net of total charge-offs of $1.2 million, which included a partial charge-off of $967 thousand for a substandard nonaccrual construction loan collateralized by a stalled construction project in Los Angeles, California. Based on the Company’s internal analysis, which included a review of an updated appraisal, the estimated net collateral value was $9.7 million, which was $967 thousand lower than the subject loan’s net carrying value resulting in a partial charge-off in the third quarter of 2024. The Company expects to pursue the resolution of this matter. Non-performing assets in the third quarter of 2024 included OREO, net of valuation allowance, of $4.1 million related to a multifamily nonaccrual loan of $4.7 million that was transferred to OREO and the Company recorded a $614 thousand valuation allowance on OREO due to a decline in the fair value of the underlying property in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nTotal non-performing loans increased to $25.7 million, or 0.80% of total loans held for investment at September 30, 2024, compared with $4.7 million, or 0.25% of total loans at June 30, 2024. The increase from June 30, 2024 was due primarily to the aforementioned downgrades of a construction loan and 1-4 family residential loan from one relationship, nonaccrual PCD loans acquired in the merger and partial charge-offs of loans in the amount of $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nSpecial mention loans increased by $65.6 million, including $41.0 million non-PCD loans and $10.1 million PCD loans, during the third quarter of 2024 to $93.4 million at September 30, 2024. The $14.5 million increase in the legacy special mention loans was due mostly to a $2.2 million increase in special mention commercial real estate loans and a $12.3 million increase in special mention commercial and industrial loans. Substandard loans increased by $81.2 million, including $2.3 million non-PCD loans, $71.3 million PCD loans, and $13.5 million nonaccrual PCD loans, during the third quarter of 2024 to $104.3 million at September 30, 2024. The $5.8 million decrease in the legacy substandard loans was due primarily to the transfer of a multifamily nonaccrual loan of $4.7 million to OREO and the partial charge-off of $967 thousand for the nonaccrual construction loan, partially offset by a downgrade to substandard of a commercial and industrial loan of $118 thousand during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThe Company had $37 thousand in consumer solar loans that were over 90 days past due that were accruing interest at September 30, 2024, and no delinquencies at June 30, 2024.\n\nThere were $19.1 million in loan delinquencies (30-89 days past due, excluding nonaccrual loans) at September 30, 2024 and no delinquencies at June 30, 2024.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses, which is comprised of the allowance for loan losses (“ALL”) and reserve for unfunded loan commitments, totaled $57.6 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $24.6 million at June 30, 2024. The $33.0 million increase in the allowance included a $19.7 million provision for credit losses for the loan portfolio, of which $11.2 million related to the initial allowance for credit losses on acquired PCD loans, $21.3 million related to the initial provision for credit losses on acquired non-PCD loans and unfunded loan commitments, partially offset by total charge-offs of $1.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nThe ALL was $53.6 million, or 1.67% of total loans held for investment at September 30, 2024, compared with $23.8 million, or 1.27% at June 30, 2024.\n\n**Capital**\n\nTangible book value (non-GAAP1) per common share at September 30, 2024, was $11.28, compared with $13.71 at June 30, 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, tangible book value was primarily impacted by the net loss for the third quarter, the impact of equity issued in connection with the merger, stock-based compensation expense, and a decrease in net of unrealized tax losses on available-for-sale debt securities. Other comprehensive losses related to unrealized losses, net of taxes, on available-for-sale debt securities decreased by $3.6 million to $2.9 million at September 30, 2024, from $6.5 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease in the unrealized losses, net of taxes, on available-for-sale debt securities was primarily attributable to factors other than credit related, including decreases in market interest rates driven by the Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point rate cut in September 2024. Tangible common equity (non-GAAP1) as a percentage of total tangible assets (non-GAAP1) at September 30, 2024, decreased to 8.58% from 11.28% in the prior quarter, and unrealized losses, net of taxes, on available-for-sale debt securities as a percentage of tangible common equity (non-GAAP1) at September 30, 2024 decreased to 0.8% from 2.6% in the prior quarter.\n\nThe Company’s preliminary capital exceeds minimums required to be “well-capitalized” at September 30, 2024.\n\n**ABOUT CALIFORNIA BANCORP**\n\nCalifornia BanCorp (NASDAQ: BCAL) is a registered bank holding company headquartered in San Diego, California.

Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current view about future events and involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed in the forward-looking statement or historical results.

These non-GAAP financial measures complement our GAAP reporting and are presented below to provide investors and others with information that we use to manage the business each period. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.
