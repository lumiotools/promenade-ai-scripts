All forward-looking statements made by us are subject to risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance and achievements or industry results to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These statements are generally identified by the use of such terms as “may,” “could,” “expect,” “intend,” “believe,” “plan,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “anticipate,” “to be,” “to make” or other comparable terms. A fuller discussion of our operations, financial condition, and status of litigation matters, including factors that may affect our business and future prospects, is contained in documents we have filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and will be contained in all subsequent periodic filings we make with the SEC. These documents identify in detail important risk factors that could cause our actual performance to differ materially from current expectations. Forward looking statements include the overall impact of the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the Company, its results of operations, liquidity and financial condition (including any estimates of the impact on these items), the rate and consistency with which dental and other practices resume or maintain normal operations in the United States and internationally, expectations regarding personal protective equipment (“PPE”) products and COVID-19 related product sales and inventory levels, whether additional resurgences or variants of the virus will adversely impact the resumption of normal operations, whether supply chain disruptions will adversely impact our business, the impact of integration and restructuring programs as well as of any future acquisitions, general economic conditions including exchange rates, inflation and recession, and more generally current expectations regarding performance in current and future periods. Forward looking statements also include the (i) ability of the Company to have continued access to a variety of COVID-19 test types, expectations regarding COVID-19 test sales, demand and inventory levels, as well as the efficacy or relative efficacy of the test results given that the test efficacy has not been, or will not have been, independently verified under normal FDA procedures, and (ii) potential for the Company to distribute the COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies. \n\nRisk factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current and historical results include, but are not limited to: risks associated with COVID-19 and any variants thereof, as well as other disease outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, or similar wide-spread public health concerns and other natural disasters; our dependence on third parties for the manufacture and supply of our products; our ability to develop or acquire and maintain and protect new products (particularly technology products) and technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins; transitional challenges associated with acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures, including the failure to achieve anticipated synergies/benefits; legal, regulatory, compliance, cybersecurity, financial and tax risks associated with acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures; certain provisions in our governing documents that may discourage third-party acquisitions of us; adverse changes in supplier rebates or other purchasing incentives; risks related to the sale of corporate brand products; effects of a highly competitive (including, without limitation, competition from third-party online commerce sites) and consolidating market; the repeal or judicial prohibition on implementation of the Affordable Care Act; changes in the health care industry; risks from expansion of customer purchasing power and multi-tiered costing structures; increases in shipping costs for our products or other service issues with our third-party shippers; general global and domestic macroeconomic and political conditions, including inflation, deflation, recession, fluctuations in energy pricing and the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies and changes to other economic indicators, international trade agreements, potential trade barriers and terrorism; failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements; risks associated with the EU Medical Device Regulation; failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud or other laws and regulations; failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to the collection, storage and processing of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health records or transmissions; changes in tax legislation; risks related to product liability, intellectual property and other claims; litigation risks; new or unanticipated litigation developments and the status of litigation matters; risks associated with customs policies or legislative import restrictions; cyberattacks or other privacy or data security breaches; risks associated with our global operations; our dependence on our senior management, employee hiring and retention, and our relationships with customers, suppliers and manufacturers; and disruptions in financial markets. The order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority. \n\nWe caution that these factors may not be exhaustive and that many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Accordingly, any forward-looking statements contained herein should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. We undertake no duty and have no obligation to update forward-looking statements except as required by law. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241119215268r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241119215268/en/>\n\nInvestors Ronald N.

(Nasdaq: HSIC), the world’s largest provider of health care solutions to office-based dental and medical practitioners, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 28, 2024.\n\n“Our businesses performed well during the third quarter, driven by the continued successful implementation of our BOLD+1 Strategic Plan that is resulting in growth and efficiency throughout the business, and a strong contribution from high-growth, high-margin products and services,” said Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein. “We believe we continued to steadily gain market share in our dental and medical distribution businesses following last year’s cyber incident. Our dental equipment business is showing ongoing stability in North America and increased investment by customers in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Implant and endodontic products had good growth in Europe and Brazil, as well as North America following the successful launch of the BioHorizons Tapered Pro Conical implant in the U.S.,” Mr. Bergman added.\n\n“Acquisitions made during our 2022 to 2024 strategic planning cycle, along with new product launches, are delivering strong financial results, and our restructuring plan is on target. We also continue to return capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program. As a result, we exceeded our financial expectations for the quarter, and so today we are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance to $4.74 to $4.82,” Mr. Bergman concluded.\n\n**Third-Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Total net sales** for the quarter were $3.2 billion, an increase of 0.4% compared with the third quarter of 2023. This reflects 3.2% sales growth from acquisitions, a 0.2% sales decrease resulting from foreign currency exchange rates, a 0.4% sales decrease from lower sales of personal protective equipment (PPE), primarily the result of lower glove pricing, and the pace of recovery from the cyber incident late last year.\n  * **Internal sales** for the quarter decreased 2.6%, which includes a 0.4% decrease from lower PPE sales.\n\n\n\nThird-quarter sales and internal sales growth are summarized below and detailed in Exhibit A1.\n\n**Sales****($ Billion)**| **Total****Growth/(Decrease) 1 ****(%)**| **Internal****Growth/(Decrease) 1 ****(%)**  \n---|---|---  \n**Global Dental**| **$1.9**| **(1.6%)**| **(1.6%)**  \nMerchandise| $1.4| (2.8%)| (2.5%)  \nEquipment| $0.4| 2.8%| 1.8%  \n**Global Medical**| **$1.1**| **2.9%**| **(4.8%)**  \n**Global Technology and Value-Added Services**| **$0.2**| **5.1%**| **(1.1%)**  \n**TOTAL SALES**| **$3.2**| **0.4%**| **(2.6%)**  \nNote: items may not sum due to rounding  \n  \n  * **GAAP net income** 2 for the quarter was $99 million, or $0.78 per diluted share4, and compares with third-quarter 2023 GAAP net income of $137 million, or $1.05 per diluted share.\n  * **Non-GAAP net income** 2 for the quarter was $155 million, or $1.22 per diluted share4, and compares with third-quarter 2023 non-GAAP net income of $173 million, or $1.32 per diluted share. GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS included a remeasurement gain of $0.11 resulting from the purchase of a controlling interest of a previously held non-controlling equity investment.\n  * **Operating cash flow** for the quarter was $151 million and compares with operating cash flow in the third-quarter 2023 of $231 million.\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA** 3 for the quarter was $268 million and compares with third-quarter 2023 Adjusted EBITDA of $278 million. \n\n\n\n**Year-to-Date Financial Results**\n\n  * **Total net sales** for the first nine months of 2024 were $9.5 billion, an increase of 1.7% compared with the first nine months of 2023. This reflects 4.1% sales growth from acquisitions, a 0.1% sales decrease resulting from foreign currency exchange rates, a 0.6% sales decrease from lower sales of personal protective equipment, and the pace of recovery from the cyber incident late last year.\n  * **Internal sales** for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 2.3%, which includes a 0.6% decrease from lower PPE sales.\n\n\n\nFirst nine months of 2024 sales and internal sales growth are summarized below and detailed in Exhibit A1.\n\n**Sales****($ Billion)**| **Total****Growth/(Decrease) 1 ****(%)**| **Internal****Growth/(Decrease) 1****(%)**  \n---|---|---  \n**Global Dental**| **$5.7**| **(0.8%)**| **(2.2%)**  \nMerchandise| $4.4| (1.3%)| (3.0%)  \nEquipment| $1.3| 0.9%| 0.5%  \n**Global Medical**| **$3.1**| **5.0%**| **(3.3%)**  \n**Global Technology and Value-Added Services**| **$0.7**| **9.7%**| **1.9%**  \n**TOTAL SALES**| **$9.5**| **1.7%**| **(2.3%)**  \nNote: items may not sum due to rounding  \n  \n  * **GAAP net income** 2 for the first nine months of 2024 was $296 million, or $2.30 per diluted share4, and compares with first nine months of 2023 GAAP net income of $398 million, or $3.02 per diluted share.\n  * **Non-GAAP net income** 2 for the first nine months of 2024 was $456 million, or $3.55 per diluted share4, and compares with first nine months of 2023 non-GAAP net income of $507 million, or $3.84 per diluted share. GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS for the first nine months included a remeasurement gain of $0.11 resulting from the purchase of a controlling interest of a previously held equity investment and compares with a remeasurement gain of $0.10 recorded in the second quarter of 2023.\n  * **Operating cash flow** for the first nine months of 2024 was $644 million, an increase of $112 million compared with the first nine months of 2023.\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA** 3 for the first nine months of 2024 was $791 million and compares with first nine months of 2023 Adjusted EBITDA of $813 million.\n\n\n\n**Restructuring Plan**\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded $48 million in restructuring costs. This includes $12 million incurred as part of the plan announced in the third quarter of 2022, which was completed on July 31, 2024, and $36 million incurred as part of the 2024/2025 restructuring initiative announced last quarter. Actions approved in the third quarter under the new restructuring plan are estimated to provide over $50 million in annual run-rate savings, which the Company believes indicates strong progress towards its goal of $75 million to $100 million in annual run-rate savings by the end of 2025.\n\n**Share Repurchases**\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased approximately 2.0 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $69.09 per share, for a total of $135 million. The impact of these share repurchases on third-quarter diluted EPS was immaterial.\n\nAt quarter-end, Henry Schein had $455 million authorized and available for future stock repurchases and the Company expects to continue to repurchase shares in the fourth quarter.\n\n**2024 Financial Guidance**\n\nHenry Schein is updating full-year 2024 financial guidance, as described below. Guidance is for current continuing operations as well as acquisitions that have closed, and does not include the impact of potential future acquisitions and share repurchases, restructuring and integration expenses, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, contingent consideration revaluation adjustments, certain expenses directly associated with the cyber incident or any related insurance claim recovery. This guidance also assumes that foreign currency exchange rates remain generally consistent with current levels and that end markets remain consistent with current market conditions.\n\n  * 2024 total sales growth is now expected to be 4% to 5% over 2023, compared with prior guidance of 4% to 6% growth.\n  * 2024 non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. is now expected to be $4.74 to $4.82, compared with prior guidance of $4.70 to $4.82, and reflects growth of 5% to 7% compared with 2023 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.50.\n  * 2024 Adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow in the low-double-digit percentages versus 2023 Adjusted EBITDA, and is unchanged compared to prior guidance.\n\n\n\n**Adjustments to 2024 GAAP Net Income and Diluted EPS**\n\nThe Company is providing guidance for 2024 diluted EPS on a non-GAAP basis and for 2024 Adjusted EBITDA, as noted above. The Company is not providing a reconciliation of its 2024 non-GAAP guidance to its projected 2024 diluted EPS prepared on a GAAP basis, or its projected 2024 Adjusted EBITDA to net income prepared on a GAAP basis. This is because the Company is unable to provide without unreasonable effort an estimate of restructuring costs related to an ongoing initiative to drive operating efficiencies, including the corresponding tax effect, which will be included in the Company’s 2024 diluted EPS and net income prepared on a GAAP basis. The inability to provide this reconciliation is due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting the occurrence, magnitude, financial impact, and timing of related costs.\n\nManagement does not believe these items are representative of the Company’s underlying business performance. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.\n\n1 See Exhibit A for details of sales growth. Internal sales growth is calculated from total net sales using constant foreign currency exchange rates and excludes sales from acquisitions. 2 See Exhibit B for a reconciliation of GAAP net income and diluted EPS to non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS. 3 See Exhibit C for a reconciliation of GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA. 4 References to diluted EPS refer to diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc.\n\n**Third-Quarter 2024 Conference Call Webcast**\n\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss third-quarter 2024 financial results today, beginning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time. Individual investors are invited to listen to the conference call through Henry Schein’s website by visiting [www.henryschein.com/IRwebcasts](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.henryschein.com%2FIRwebcasts&esheet=54146727&newsitemid=20241104777524&lan=en-US&anchor=www.henryschein.com%2FIRwebcasts&index=1&md5=c14558315bcfb64d5532f2402e959f5f).

All forward-looking statements made by us are subject to risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance and achievements or industry results to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These statements include total sales growth, EPS and Adjusted EBITDA guidance and are generally identified by the use of such terms as “may,” “could,” “expect,” “intend,” “believe,” “plan,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “anticipate,” “to be,” “to make” or other comparable terms. A fuller discussion of our operations, financial condition and status of litigation matters, including factors that may affect our business and future prospects, is contained in documents we have filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and will be contained in all subsequent periodic filings we make with the SEC. These documents identify in detail important risk factors that could cause our actual performance to differ materially from current expectations.\n\nRisk factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current and historical results include, but are not limited to: our dependence on third parties for the manufacture and supply of our products; our ability to develop or acquire and maintain and protect new products (particularly technology products) and technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins; transitional challenges associated with acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures, including the failure to achieve anticipated synergies/benefits, as well as significant demands on our operations, information systems, legal, regulatory, compliance, financial and human resources functions in connection with acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures; certain provisions in our governing documents that may discourage third-party acquisitions of us; adverse changes in supplier rebates or other purchasing incentives; risks related to the sale of corporate brand products; security risks associated with our information systems and technology products and services, such as cyberattacks or other privacy or data security breaches (including the October 2023 incident); effects of a highly competitive (including, without limitation, competition from third-party online commerce sites) and consolidating market; changes in the health care industry; risks from expansion of customer purchasing power and multi-tiered costing structures; increases in shipping costs for our products or other service issues with our third-party shippers; general global and domestic macro-economic and political conditions, including inflation, deflation, recession, ongoing wars, fluctuations in energy pricing and the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, and changes to other economic indicators, international trade agreements, potential trade barriers and terrorism; geopolitical wars; failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements; risks associated with the EU Medical Device Regulation; failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud or other laws and regulations; failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to the collection, storage and processing of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health records or transmissions; changes in tax legislation; risks related to product liability, intellectual property and other claims; risks associated with customs policies or legislative import restrictions; risks associated with disease outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), or similar wide-spread public health concerns and other natural or man-made disasters; risks associated with our global operations; litigation risks; new or unanticipated litigation developments and the status of litigation matters; our dependence on our senior management, employee hiring and retention, and our relationships with customers, suppliers and manufacturers; and disruptions in financial markets. The order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority.\n\nWe caution that these factors may not be exhaustive and that many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Accordingly, any forward-looking statements contained herein should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results. We undertake no duty and have no obligation to update forward-looking statements except as required by law.\n\nIncluded within the press release are non-GAAP financial measures that supplement the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income prepared under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures adjust the Company’s actual results prepared under GAAP to exclude certain items. In the schedules attached to the press release, the non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to and should be considered together with the Consolidated Statements of Income. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business. The impact of certain items that are excluded include integration and restructuring costs, and amortization of acquisition-related assets, because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate and occur on an unpredictable basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding, similarly captioned, GAAP measures.\n\n(TABLES TO FOLLOW)\n\n**HENRY SCHEIN, INC.****CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME****(in millions, except share and per share data)****(unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n**September 28 ,**| **September 30 ,**| **September 28 ,**| **September 30 ,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet sales| $| **3,174**|  $| 3,162| $| **9,482**|  $| 9,322  \nCost of sales| **2,181**|  2,167| **6,459**|  6,386  \nGross profit| **993**|  995| **3,023**|  2,936  \nOperating expenses:  \nSelling, general and administrative| **724**|  725| **2,296**|  2,149  \nDepreciation and amortization| **64**|  59| **188**|  152  \nRestructuring costs| **48**|  11| **73**|  59  \nOperating income| **157**|  200| **466**|  576  \nOther income (expense):  \nInterest income| **7**|  6| **18**|  12  \nInterest expense| **(34**| **)**| (25| )| **(96**| **)**| (58| )  \nOther, net| **(2**| **)**| (2| )| **(1**| **)**| (2| )  \nIncome before taxes, equity in earnings of affiliates and noncontrolling interests| **128**|  179| **387**|  528  \nIncome taxes| **(32**| **)**| (39| )| **(97**| **)**| (119| )  \nEquity in earnings of affiliates, net of tax| **3**|  3| **12**|  10  \nNet income| **99**|  143| **302**|  419  \nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests| **-**| (6| )| **(6**| **)**| (21| )  \nNet income attributable to Henry Schein, Inc.| $| **99**|  $| 137| $| **296**|  $| 398  \n**Earnings per share attributable to Henry Schein, Inc.:**  \nBasic| $| **0.79**|  $| 1.06| $| **2.32**|  $| 3.04  \nDiluted| $| **0.78**|  $| 1.05| $| **2.30**|  $| 3.02  \nWeighted-average common shares outstanding:  \nBasic| **126,124,715**|  130,388,353| **127,550,045**|  130,888,717  \nDiluted| **127,054,934**|  131,442,135| **128,498,494**|  132,149,172  \n**HENRY SCHEIN, INC.****CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS****(in millions, except share data)**  \n---  \n**September 28 ,**| **December 30 ,**  \n**2024**| **2023**  \n**(unaudited)**  \n**ASSETS**  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents| **$**| **126**|  $| 171  \nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses of $86 and $83| **1,660**|  1,863  \nInventories, net| **1,754**|  1,815  \nPrepaid expenses and other| **607**|  639  \nTotal current assets| **4,147**|  4,488  \nProperty and equipment, net| **540**|  498  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets| **304**|  325  \nGoodwill| **3,986**|  3,875  \nOther intangibles, net| **1,100**|  916  \nInvestments and other| **528**|  471  \nTotal assets| **$**| **10,605**|  $| 10,573  \n**LIABILITIES, REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY**  \nCurrent liabilities:  \nAccounts payable| **$**| **1,026**|  $| 1,020  \nBank credit lines| **638**|  264  \nCurrent maturities of long-term debt| **109**|  150  \nOperating lease liabilities| **77**|  80  \nAccrued expenses:  \nPayroll and related| **289**|  332  \nTaxes| **159**|  137  \nOther| **631**|  700  \nTotal current liabilities| **2,929**|  2,683  \nLong-term debt| **1,906**|  1,937  \nDeferred income taxes| **123**|  54  \nOperating lease liabilities| **262**|  310  \nOther liabilities| **414**|  436  \nTotal liabilities| **5,634**|  5,420  \nRedeemable noncontrolling interests| **832**|  864  \nCommitments and contingencies  \nStockholders' equity:  \nPreferred stock, $0.01 par value, 1,000,000 shares authorized,  \nnone outstanding| **-**|  -
