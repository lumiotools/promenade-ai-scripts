Utilizing UroGen’s proprietary _RTGel_ ® technology, a sustained release, hydrogel-based formulation, UGN-102 is designed to enable longer exposure of bladder tissue to mitomycin, thereby enabling the treatment of tumors by non-surgical means. UGN-102 is delivered to patients using a standard urinary catheter in an outpatient setting by a trained healthcare professional. UroGen completed the NDA submission in August, ahead of schedule. The FDA accepted the NDA for UGN-102 and assigned a PDUFA goal date of June 13, 2025. \n\n**About JELMYTO**\n\nJELMYTO® (mitomycin) for pyelocalyceal solution is a mitomycin-containing reverse thermal gel containing 4 mg mitomycin per mL gel indicated for the treatment of adult patients with LG-UTUC. It is recommended for primary treatment of biopsy-proven LG-UTUC in patients deemed appropriate candidates for renal-sparing therapy. JELMYTO is a viscous liquid when cooled and becomes a semi-solid gel at body temperature. The drug slowly dissolves over four to six hours after instillation and is removed from the urinary tract by normal urine flow and voiding. It is approved for administration in a retrograde manner via ureteral catheter or antegrade through nephrostomy tube. The delivery system allows the initial liquid to coat and conform to the upper urinary tract anatomy. The eventual semisolid gel allows for chemoablative therapy to remain in the collecting system for four to six hours without immediately being diluted or washed away by urine flow. \n\n**UGN-301**\n\nUGN-301 is our investigational, in-licensed, anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody (zalifrelimab), prepared with reverse-thermal hydrogel for intravesical administration into the bladder. Intravesical administration of UGN-301 is designed to increase drug concentrations in the bladder without significant systemic exposure, potentially diminishing the systemic toxicity associated with CTLA-4 blockade. UroGen is evaluating UGN-301 as combination therapy for the intravesical treatment of high-grade NMIBC. \n\n**About UroGen Pharma Ltd.**\n\nUroGen is a biotech company dedicated to developing and commercializing innovative solutions that treat urothelial and specialty cancers because patients deserve better options. UroGen has developed RTGel® reverse-thermal hydrogel, a proprietary sustained-release, hydrogel-based platform technology that has the potential to improve the therapeutic profiles of existing drugs. UroGen’s sustained release technology is designed to enable longer exposure of the urinary tract tissue to medications, making local therapy a potentially more effective treatment option. Our first product to treat LG-UTUC and investigational treatment UGN-102 (mitomycin) for intravesical solution for patients with low-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer are designed to ablate tumors by non-surgical means. UroGen is headquartered in Princeton, NJ with operations in Israel.

(Nasdaq: URGN), a biotech company dedicated to developing and commercializing novel solutions that treat urothelial and specialty cancers, today highlights results from a long-term follow-up study with JELMYTO (mitomycin) for pyelocalyceal solution, which is FDA approved for the treatment of low-grade, upper tract urothelial cancer (LG-UTUC) in adult patients. Among patients from the OLYMPUS trial who achieved a complete response after primary chemoablation with JELMYTO (n=41, 20 of whom entered the long-term follow-up study), the median duration of response was 47.8 months (median follow-up 28.1 months [95% CI 13.1, 57.5]). The study results are published online in the [_Journal of Urology_](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.auajournals.org%2Fdoi%2F10.1097%2FJU.0000000000004331&esheet=54158240&newsitemid=20241126501899&lan=en-US&anchor=Journal+of+Urology&index=1&md5=5fa095edff8c4505534c86d4238817e0). \n\n“The median DOR of 47.8 months in patients who achieved complete response with JELMYTO provides evidence of robust durability in maintaining control of low-grade UTUC over an extended period,” said Phillip Pierorazio, M.D., Chief, Section of Urology, Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, Professor of Surgery, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, P.A., study author and member of the American Urological Association (AUA)/ Annual Society of Urological Oncology (SUO) UTUC Guideline Committee. “The AUA/SUO recommend that urologists use kidney-sparing techniques as the preferred management strategy for patients with low-grade UTUC when possible. JELMYTO, with this evidence for extended durability of complete response, offers the opportunity for durable recurrence-free intervals.” \n\nOf the 71 patients enrolled in OLYMPUS, 41 achieved a complete response after treatment with JELMYTO and had a median duration of response of 47.8 months (95% CI 13.0, not estimable), with median follow-up of 28.1 months (95% CI 13.1, 57.5). \n\n\"Previous research indicates that managing relapse and preserving organ function should be the primary treatment goal for LG-UTUC due to the low risk of disease progression,” said Mark Schoenberg, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of UroGen. “We are encouraged by the study's findings providing compelling evidence for favorable long-term durability of JELMYTO as a primary treatment for LG-UTUC, with increasing evidence showing extended response times in some patients.\" \n\nThe analysis has certain limitations, including its post-hoc nature and the inherent selection bias of the 20 patients enrolled in the long-term follow-up study. \n\nTo further explore the potential of JELMYTO in treating patients with UTUC, investigators are currently enrolling participants in the JELMYTO uTRACT Registry to gather longitudinal real-world usage data. As of July 10, 19 sites have been activated with 191 patients enrolled. \n\n**About JELMYTO**\n\nJELMYTO® (mitomycin) for pyelocalyceal solution is a mitomycin-containing reverse thermal gel containing 4 mg mitomycin per mL gel indicated for the treatment of adult patients with low-grade-UTUC (LG-UTUC). It is approved for adult patients with LG-UTUC. JELMYTO is a viscous liquid when cooled and becomes a semi-solid gel at body temperature. The drug slowly dissolves over four to six hours after instillation and is removed from the urinary tract by normal urine flow and voiding. It is approved for administration in a retrograde manner via ureteral catheter or antegrade through nephrostomy tube. The delivery system allows the initial liquid to coat and conform to the upper urinary tract anatomy. The eventual semisolid gel allows for chemoablative therapy to remain in the collecting system for four to six hours without immediately being diluted or washed away by urine flow _._\n\n**About Upper Tract Urothelial Cancer (UTUC)**\n\nUrothelial cancer is the ninth most common cancer globally and the eighth most lethal neoplasm in men in the U.S. Between five percent and ten percent of primary urothelial cancers originate in the ureter or renal pelvis and are collectively referred to as UTUC. In the U.S., there are approximately 6,000 - 7,000 new or recurrent LG-UTUC patients annually. Most cases are diagnosed in patients over 70 years old, and these older patients often face comorbidities. There are limited treatment options for UTUC, with the most common being endoscopic surgery or nephroureterectomy (removal of the entire kidney and ureter). Treatment with endoscopic surgery can lead to a high rate of recurrence and relapse. \n\n**About UroGen Pharma Ltd.**\n\nUroGen is a biotech company dedicated to developing and commercializing innovative solutions that treat urothelial and specialty cancers because patients deserve better options.

Our team is fully focused on preparing for a successful commercial launch of UGN-102, if approved, in 2025.”\n\n**Q3 2024 and Recent Business Highlights:**\n\n**UGN-102 (mitomycin) for intravesical solution:**\n\n  * In October 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted UroGen’s New Drug Application (NDA) for investigational drug UGN-102 (mitomycin) for intravesical solution as a treatment for low-grade intermediate risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (LG-IR-NMIBC). The FDA granted a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of June 13, 2025.\n  * The NDA for UGN-102 is supported by a comprehensive development program which demonstrated a clinically meaningful complete response rate and a strong duration of response across three late phase clinical trials and an acceptable safety profile. The Phase 3 ENVISION trial successfully met its primary endpoint by demonstrating that patients treated with UGN-102 had a 79.6% (95% CI, 73.9%, 84.5%) complete response (CR) rate at three months following the first instillation of UGN-102. More recently, durability data from ENVISION showed that UGN-102 demonstrated an 82.3% (95% CI, 75.9%, 87.1%) 12-month duration of response (DOR) by Kaplan-Meier estimate in patients who had achieved a complete response at three months after the first instillation of UGN-102. This is the highest DOR ever reported in this patient population. The ENVISION trial demonstrated that UGN-102 has an acceptable safety profile that is consistent with the side effect profile observed in previous clinical trials.\n\n\n\n**JELMYTO (mitomycin) for pyelocalyceal solution in low-grade upper tract urothelial cancer (LG-UTUC):**\n\n  * Generated net product revenue of $25.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $20.9 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by strong underlying demand growth and also reflecting non-patient purchases.\n\n\n\n**Next-generation novel mitomycin-based formulation for urothelial cancers**\n\n  * In October 2024, the first patient was dosed in the Phase 3 UTOPIA clinical trial of investigational drug UGN-103 (mitomycin) for intravesical solution in patients with LG-IR-NMIBC. UGN-103 is a next generation product that combines UroGen’s RTGel® technology with a novel mitomycin formulation licensed from medac GmbH. UGN-103 is planned to follow the potential FDA approval and launch of UGN-102 for LG-IR-NMIBC. UroGen plans to initiate a Phase 3 study early next year to explore the safety and efficacy of UGN-104, its next generation product for the treatment of LG-UTUC. To learn more about the UTOPIA trial, refer to [clinicaltrials.gov/NCT06331299](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT06331299&esheet=54147609&newsitemid=20241106678091&lan=en-US&anchor=clinicaltrials.gov%2FNCT06331299&index=1&md5=3e0ba60cc2ff31a5d9e082bf073eb7df).\n  * In September 2024, UroGen received a Notice of Allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office for a patent application covering, among other things, the use of UGN-103 in the treatment of LG-IR-NMIBC. The U.S. patent, once issued, will have an expiration date in December 2041.\n\n\n\n**Corporate**\n\n  * In October 2024, UroGen appointed Chris Degnan as Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Degnan brings broad expertise in financial strategy, investor relations, SEC reporting, accounting and compliance, having previously held CFO roles at Galera Therapeutics and Verrica Pharmaceuticals. He replaced Don Kim who left the Company to pursue other opportunities.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**JELMYTO Revenue:** JELMYTO net product revenues were $25.2 million and $20.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\n\n**R &D Expense: **Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $11.4 million, including non-cash share-based compensation expense of $0.6 million as compared to $10.2 million, including non-cash share-based compensation expense of $0.4 million, for the same period in 2023.\n\n**SG &A Expense: **Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $28.9 million, including non-cash share-based compensation expense of $2.9 million. This compares to $21.8 million, including non-cash share-based compensation expense of $1.8 million, for the same period in 2023.\n\n**Financing on Prepaid Forward Obligation:** UroGen reported non-cash financing expense related to the prepaid forward obligation to RTW Investments of $5.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $5.5 million in the same period in 2023.\n\n**Interest Expense on Long-Term Debt:** Interest expense related to the outstanding $125 million term loan facility with funds managed by Pharmakon Advisors was $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $3.8 million in the same period in 2023.\n\n**Net Loss:** UroGen reported a net loss of $23.7 million or ($0.55) per basic and diluted share in the third quarter of 2024 compared with a net loss of $21.9 million or ($0.68) per basic and diluted share in the same period in 2023.\n\n**Cash & Cash Equivalents: **As of September 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $254.2 million.\n\nFor further details on the Company’s financials, including results for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2024, refer to Form 10-Q, filed with the SEC.\n\n**2024 Revenue, Operating Expense, and RTW Expense Guidance:** With respect to the Company’s previously provided full-year 2024 JELMYTO revenue guidance, the Company expects full-year revenues to be below the low end of the guidance range. The Company does expect JELMYTO to achieve low double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for the full year 2024. With respect to the Company’s previously provided full-year 2024 operating expenses guidance, the Company expects to be toward the midpoint of the guidance range, including non-cash share-based compensation expense of $9 to $13 million, subject to market conditions. The anticipated full year 2024 non-cash financing expense related to the prepaid obligation to RTW Investments is unchanged and expected to be in the range of $21 to $26 million. The rate for the cash component of the RTW obligation will be 13% of global net product sales of JELMYTO in 2024.\n\n**Conference Call & Webcast Information: **Members of UroGen’s management team will host a live conference call and webcast today at 10:00 AM Eastern Time to review UroGen’s financial results and provide a general business update.\n\nThe live webcast can be accessed by visiting the Investors section of the Company’s website at [http://investors.UroGen.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.urogen.com&esheet=54147609&newsitemid=20241106678091&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.UroGen.com&index=2&md5=05bc001bd86876b83b4ab602a43ca8a4).

It is recommended for primary treatment of biopsy-proven LG-UTUC in patients deemed appropriate candidates for renal-sparing therapy. JELMYTO is a viscous liquid when cooled and becomes a semi-solid gel at body temperature. The drug slowly dissolves over four to six hours after instillation and is removed from the urinary tract by normal urine flow and voiding. It is approved for administration in a retrograde manner via ureteral catheter or antegrade through nephrostomy tube. The delivery system allows the initial liquid to coat and conform to the upper urinary tract anatomy. The eventual semisolid gel allows for chemoablative therapy to remain in the collecting system for four to six hours without immediately being diluted or washed away by urine flow _._\n\n**APPROVED USE FOR JELMYTO**\n\nJELMYTO® is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with a type of cancer of the lining of the upper urinary tract including the kidney called low-grade Upper Tract Urothelial Cancer (LG-UTUC).\n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**You should not receive JELMYTO if you** have a hole or tear (perforation) of your bladder or upper urinary tract.\n\n**Before receiving JELMYTO, tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions, including if you****:**\n\n  * are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.

In the U.S _._ , there are approximately 6,000 - 7,000 new or recurrent low-grade UTUC patients annually. Most cases are diagnosed in patients over 70 years old, and these older patients often face comorbidities. There are limited treatment options for UTUC, with the most common being endoscopic surgery or nephroureterectomy (removal of the entire kidney and ureter). These treatments can lead to a high rate of recurrence and relapse.\n\n**About UGN-102**\n\nUGN-102 (mitomycin) for intravesical solution is an innovative drug formulation of mitomycin, currently under regulatory review for approval in the treatment of LG-IR-NMIBC. Utilizing UroGen’s proprietary RTGel® technology, a sustained release, hydrogel-based formulation, UGN-102 is designed to enable longer exposure of bladder tissue to mitomycin, thereby enabling the treatment of tumors by non-surgical means. UGN-102 is delivered to patients using a standard urinary catheter in an outpatient setting by a trained healthcare professional. An NDA for UGN-102 is currently under review by the FDA with a potential decision expected by June 13, 2025. The U.S. market for LG-IR-NMIBC that UGN-102 can address, if approved, is valued at approximately $5 billion.\n\n**About UroGen Pharma Ltd.**\n\nUroGen is a biotech company dedicated to developing and commercializing innovative solutions that treat urothelial and specialty cancers because patients deserve better options.
