          "content": "WSFS Financial Corporation\nInvestor Overview\nAugust 2024\nWHERE THERE’S A WSFS, THERE’S A WAY.\n1\nForward Looking Statements & Non-GAAP\nForward looking statements:\nThis presentation contains estimates, predictions, opinions, projections and other \"forward-looking statements\" as that phrase is defined in the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements include, without limitation, references to the Company's predictions or expectations of future business or financial\nperformance as well as its goals and objectives for future operations, financial and business trends, business prospects, and management's outlook or expectations for\nearnings, revenues, expenses, capital levels, liquidity levels, asset quality or other future financial or business performance, strategies or expectations. The words\n“believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “estimate,” “target,” “project” and similar expressions, among others, generally identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-\nlooking statements are based on various assumptions (some of which may be beyond the Company's control) and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties (which\nchange over time) and other factors, including the impacts related to or resulting from bank failures and other economic and industry volatility, including potential\nincreased regulatory requirements and costs and potential impacts to macroeconomic conditions, the uncertain effects of geopolitical instability, armed conflicts, public\nhealth crises, inflation, interest rates and actions taken in response thereto on our business, results of operations, capital and liquidity, which could cause actual results to\ndiffer materially from those currently anticipated. Such risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and other documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission from\ntime to time.\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made, and the Company\ndisclaims any duty to revise or update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of the Company for any\nreason, except as specifically required by law. As used in this presentation, the terms \"WSFS\", \"the Company\", \"registrant\", \"we\", \"us\", and \"our\" mean WSFS Financial\nCorporation and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, unless the context indicates otherwise.\nNon-GAAP financial measures:\nThis presentation contains financial measures determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\n(“GAAP”). These non-GAAP measures include core earnings per share (“EPS”), core efficiency ratio, pre-provision net revenue (“PPNR”), PPNR to average assets ratio,\ncore PPNR to average assets ratio, core net revenue, core PPNR, core return on assets (“ROA”), core net interest income, core noninterest expense, tangible common\nbook value (“TBV”), TBV excluding AOCI, tangible common equity (“TCE”), tangible assets, tangible equity, return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”), core ROTCE,\ncore fee revenue, core fee revenue ratio, effective AOCI, and coverage ratio including the estimated remaining credit marks. The Company’s management believes that\nthese non-GAAP measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of results of operations with prior periods and show the effects\nof significant gains and charges in the periods presented. The Company’s management believes that investors may use these non-GAAP measures to analyze the\nCompany’s financial performance without the impact of unusual items or events that may obscure trends in the Company’s underlying performance. This non-GAAP data\nshould be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and is not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. For a reconciliation of these non-\nGAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures, see the Appendix.\n2\nWhy Invest in WSFS?\nDelivering top-quintile financial performance\n1 Commitment to long-term sustainable high performance: 4 Significant franchise investments:\n• Core ROA ranked 78th percentile in 2022, 80th percentile • Technology – Salesforce© CRM, enterprise-wide data\nin 2023, and 82nd percentile in 1H24 vs. KRX Peers1,2 strategy, Trust Accounting System, updating payment\nplatforms, and retail office bank account servicing\n• Returned 63% of earnings over the past five calendar\nyears and 58% in 1H24 through buybacks and dividends • Talent – Ongoing investment with multiple key hires\nannounced in the past 12 months\n2 Differentiated fee revenue3:\n5 Diverse customer base:\n• 32% of total revenue in 1H24; Wealth, Trust, and Cash\n• C&I loans compose 35% of gross loans\nConnect® fees generated 25% of total revenue\n• 49% of deposits from Consumer, 24% from Commercial,\n• Mortgage and Capital Markets capabilities\n13% from Small Business, and 13% from Wealth and Trust\n3 Highly attractive market position4,5:\n6 Strong balance sheet:\n• Uniquely positioned between larger out-of-market banks\n• Capital ratios significantly above “well-capitalized” including\nand smaller community banks/credit unions\nthe impact of effective AOCI2\n• Ranked 6th in deposits for the 5th largest MSA depository\n• 1.67% ACL coverage ratio2,6 and all 22 loan concentration\nin the country\nlimits within approved levels\n1 S&P Global; KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking Index (KRX) peer group pulled as of Aug 1, 2024 4 U.S. Census Bureau (2022), American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates\n2 This is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered along with results prepared in accordance with GAAP, 5 FDIC and S&P Global.

In addition, deposits grew 3% on an\nannualized basis primarily due to seasonal municipal deposit inflows.\n“Our diverse fee businesses also continued to perform solidly. During the quarter, we completed the\nconversions of our trust accounting system and client portal in our Wealth Management business. These\nconversions were executed as part of our Bryn Mawr Trust integration plan and position us for significant\nfuture growth.\n“Total net credit costs increased modestly compared to the prior quarter with a decrease in the provision\nfor credit losses offset by an increase in reserves for unfunded loan commitments. The negative migration\nin credit metrics includes two existing problem commercial loans (office-related and hotel) which moved\nto nonperforming assets in the quarter.\n\"While the 50 basis point decrease in the Fed Funds Rate in mid-September had a minimal impact on 3Q\nresults, we have updated our full-year 2024 Outlook in our Earnings Release Supplement to reflect this\nchange.\n“We look forward to finishing 2024 strong and as always I want to extend my sincere thanks to our 2,300\nAssociates who work tirelessly to serve our Customers, Communities and each other every day.”\n(2) As used in this press release, core ROA and core EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain pre-tax\nadjustments and the tax impact of such adjustments.

Provision for credit\nlosses was $18.4 million, a decline of $1.4 million from the prior quarter, which was offset by\nincreases in loan workout costs and reserves for unfunded commitments.\n• WSFS repurchased 266,672 shares of common stock at an average price of $51.82 per share, totaling\nan aggregate of $13.8 million. Tangible common book value (TBV) per share(3) increased by $3.36 to\n$28.56.

Total commercial loans and leases increased $104.6 million, with growth from new\noriginations and the conversion of construction loans, which drove increases in the C&I and commercial\nmortgage portfolios.\nConsumer loans increased $31.6 million, primarily from Spring EQ home equity loans, partially offset by\na decrease in Upstart loans. We met the 2024 origination target with Spring EQ and do not expect\nadditional originations in the fourth quarter. As a result of the previously announced sale of Spring EQ, we\nare evaluating volumes for 2025. Residential mortgages increased $29.2 million due to the retention of\ncertain loans based on favorable yields and relationship opportunities.\nGross loans and leases at September 30, 2024 increased $649.2 million, or 5%, when compared with\nSeptember 30, 2023. The growth was driven by increases of $503.3 million in commercial mortgage,\n$181.0 million in consumer loans (primarily from Spring EQ), $91.9 million in residential mortgage due\nto the reasons noted above, and $71.0 million in C&I. These increases were partially offset by a $237.7\nmillion decrease in construction loans, as they migrated into commercial mortgages and C&I loans,\nincluding owner-occupied real estate.\nWSFS Bank Center WSFS Bank Place 5\n500 Delaware Avenue 1818 Market Street\nWilmington, DE 19801 Philadelphia, PA 19103\nThe following table summarizes customer deposit balances and composition at September 30, 2024\ncompared to June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:\nCustomer Deposits\n(Dollars in millions) September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nNoninterest demand $ 4,686 29 % $ 4,783 29 % $ 4,913 31 %\nInterest-bearing demand 2,931 18 2,812 17 3,028 19\nSavings 1,489 9 1,537 9 1,681 10\nMoney market 5,178 31 5,175 33 4,560 29\nTotal core deposits 14,284 87 14,307 88 14,182 89\nCustomer time deposits 2,143 13 1,984 12 1,715 11\nTotal customer deposits $ 16,427 100 % $ 16,291 100 % $ 15,897 100 %\nTotal customer deposits increased by $136.0 million, 1% (3% annualized), when compared with June 30,\n2024, primarily driven by seasonal increases in municipal deposits of $227.7 million and continued\nincreases in customer time deposits, partially offset by expected outflows in Wealth and Trust deposits.\nAverage customer deposits increased 1% (5% annualized), including 12% (annualized) in noninterest\ndemand, compared to June 30, 2024, primarily from Wealth and Trust flows.\nTotal customer deposits increased by $529.8 million, or 3%, from September 30, 2023, primarily due to\nincreases in money market and time deposits. The growth was concentrated in the Commercial and\nConsumer businesses.\nThe deposit base remains well-diversified, with 51% of customer deposits coming from the Commercial,\nSmall Business, and Wealth and Trust business lines. The loan-to-deposit ratio(4) was 80% at\nSeptember 30, 2024, providing continued capacity to fund future loan growth.\nCore deposits were 87% of total customer deposits, with a weighted average cost of 159bps for the\nquarter.

Net interest income decreased $5.1 million, or 3%, compared to 3Q 2023, primarily driven\nby continued deposit mix shift and growth in higher yielding deposit products.\nTotal loan yields were 7.07%, a decrease of 2bps when compared to 2Q 2024. Total customer deposit\ncosts were 1.95%, an increase of 6bps, while interest-bearing customer deposit costs were 2.79%, an\nincrease of 10bps compared to the prior quarter. The deposit cost increase was driven by growth in higher-\npriced deposits as we saw opportunities to deepen existing relationships and attract new business.\nNet interest margin decreased 7bps from 2Q 2024, mainly due to growth in municipal and higher priced\ndeposits as described above (3bps), as well as slightly lower asset yields, which were partially driven by\nmarket-value increases on available-for-sale investment securities (2bps). Net interest margin decreased\n30bps from 3Q 2023, primarily driven by continued deposit mix shift and growth in higher priced deposit\nproducts over the past year.\nTo mitigate asset sensitivity, WSFS completed a previously announced $1.5 billion hedging program\nutilizing floor options.\nWSFS Bank Center WSFS Bank Place 7\n500 Delaware Avenue 1818 Market Street\nWilmington, DE 19801 Philadelphia, PA 19103\nAsset Quality\nThe following table summarizes asset quality metrics as of and for the period ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\n(Dollars in millions) September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nProblem assets(5) $ 721.5 $ 628.5 $ 543.4\nDelinquencies 147.6 89.0 110.8\nNonperforming assets 91.3 65.4 57.8\nNet charge-offs 19.2 14.2 14.3\nTotal net credit costs (r) 20.1 18.5 18.2\nProblem assets to total Tier 1 capital plus ACL 30.11 % 27.00 % 23.61 %\nClassified assets to total Tier 1 capital plus ACL 21.41 19.93 16.11\nRatio of nonperforming assets to total assets 0.44 0.32 0.29\nDelinquencies to gross loans (n) 1.11 0.68 0.87\nRatio of quarterly net charge-offs to average gross loans 0.58 0.44 0.45\nRatio of allowance for credit losses to total loans and leases (q) 1.48 1.51 1.39\nRatio of allowance for credit losses to nonaccruing loans 219 310 306\nSee “Notes”\nTotal net credit costs were $20.1 million in the quarter, an increase of $1.6 million, compared to $18.5\nmillion in 2Q 2024. Total net credit costs include a provision for credit losses of $18.4 million, which\ndeclined slightly from 2Q 2024. The increase in total net credit costs was due to higher reserves for\nunfunded commitments related to new loan commitments and the continued evaluation of the portfolio, as\nwell as higher loan workout costs.\nNonperforming assets increased $25.9 million, or 12bps of total assets, compared to June 30, 2024,\nprimarily driven by the migration of two loans - a $19.2 million C&I loan, in participation with another\nbank, to a fund that is invested in office properties predominantly in east coast suburban markets and a\n$14.7 million hotel loan in suburban Philadelphia, partially offset by the resolution of previously identified\nnonperforming assets.\nNet charge-offs increased $5.0 million to $19.2 million, or 0.58% (annualized) of average gross loans\nduring the quarter, mainly due to the previously identified hotel loan. Excluding Upstart and NewLane,\nwhich experienced losses consistent with the prior quarter, net charge-offs were 31bps of average gross\nloans.\nProblem assets to total Tier 1 capital plus ACL ratio was 30.11%, an increase of 311bps compared to\nJune 30, 2024, based on the continued evaluation of the portfolio.\n(5) Problem assets includes all criticized, classified, and nonperforming loans as well as other real estate owned (OREO).\nWSFS Bank Center WSFS Bank Place 8\n500 Delaware Avenue 1818 Market Street\nWilmington, DE 19801 Philadelphia, PA 19103\nDelinquencies of $147.6 million, or 111bps of gross loans, increased $58.6 million, or 43bps, compared to\nJune 30, 2024. This increase was primarily driven by the previously mentioned hotel loan and one\nadditional $42.1 million commercial real estate relationship in which we are working with the sponsor on\na path toward resolution.\nThe ACL was $197.5 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of $0.8 million from June 30, 2024.\nThe ACL coverage ratio was 1.48%, a decrease of 3bps from June 30, 2024. The decreases in the ACL\nand coverage ratio were due to continued runoff on the Upstart portfolio.\nCore Fee Revenue\nFee businesses, including Wealth and Trust, Cash Connect®, Capital Markets, and Mortgage Banking\nreflect the investments we have made to diversify our revenue. Core fee revenue (noninterest income) of\n$90.1 million increased $4.1 million, or 5% (not annualized), compared to $86.0 million from 2Q 2024,\nprimarily driven by $2.3 million of revenue from our partnership with Spring EQ (related to the annual\nearnout from the previously announced sale), $0.8 million from Cash Connect® due to increases in\nbailment and smart safe revenue, and $0.7 million from Bank Owned Life Insurance.\nCore fee revenue increased $16.7 million, or 23%, compared to 3Q 2023. The growth was driven by the\nCash Connect®, Wealth Management, Core Banking, and Mortgage business lines. Growth in Cash\nConnect® was driven by bailment Customers added in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first half of 2024.\nGrowth in Wealth Management was driven by growth across all key product lines, with double digit\ngrowth in Institutional Services and The Bryn Mawr Trust Company of Delaware (BMT of DE).\nFor 3Q 2024, our core fee revenue ratio(6) was 33.6% compared to 33.0% in 2Q 2024 and 28.6% in 3Q\n2023. Fee revenue is a competitive differentiator providing a well-diversified source of revenue with\nfurther growth opportunities expected.\n(6) As used in this press release, core fee revenue ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes certain pre-tax\nadjustments and the tax impact of such adjustments.

The increase included $3.0 million related to changes in unfunded loan commitment reserves\ndue to new loan commitments and the continued evaluation of the portfolio, as well as higher loan\nworkout costs. In addition, salaries and benefits increased by $2.9 million due to increased performance-\nbased incentive accruals and talent additions as we continue to invest in the franchise, as well as a $1.4\nmillion increase in external fraud losses.\nCore noninterest expense increased $24.1 million, or 17%, compared to 3Q 2023. The increase was\nprimarily due to $11.7 million in higher salaries and benefits from annual and performance-based\nincreases and talent additions in key business lines, as well as $8.5 million from Cash Connect® external\nfunding costs. Excluding the Cash Connect® external funding costs (which were offset in revenue),\nexpenses increased by 12% compared to 3Q 2023.\nOur core efficiency ratio(7) was 61.1% in 3Q 2024, compared to 59.8% in 2Q 2024 and 54.4% in 3Q 2023.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded a $21.1 million income tax provision in 3Q 2024, compared to $21.3 million in 2Q 2024 and\n$22.9 million in 3Q 2023.\nThe effective tax rate was 24.7% in 3Q 2024 compared to 23.5% in 2Q 2024 and 23.6% in 3Q 2023. The\nincrease in effective tax rate for 3Q 2024 compared to 2Q 2024 was primarily driven by higher state taxes\nalong with higher solar tax credit investment benefits in the second quarter. The increase in effective tax\nrate when compared to 3Q 2023 is attributable to an increase in state taxes. On a year-to-date basis, the\neffective tax rate was 24.2% in 2024 compared to 24.6% for the same period in 2023.\n(7) As used in this press release, core noninterest expense and core efficiency ratio are non-GAAP financial measures.

The\nincrease was primarily due to an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) of $142.9\nmillion driven by market-value increases on available-for-sale investment securities, as well as quarterly\nearnings of $64.4 million. These increases were partially offset by capital returns of $22.7 million to\nstockholders, comprising $13.8 million from share repurchases and $8.9 million from quarterly dividends.\nWSFS’ tangible common equity(8) increased $192.7 million, or 13% (not annualized), compared to\nJune 30, 2024, primarily due to the reasons described above and scheduled amortization of intangibles.\nWSFS’ common equity to assets ratio increased 81bps to 12.81% during the quarter, and our tangible\ncommon equity to tangible assets ratio(8) was 8.47% at September 30, 2024, an increase of 91bps,\ncompared to the prior quarter.\nAt September 30, 2024, book value per share was $45.37, an increase of $3.36, or 8% (not annualized),\nfrom June 30, 2024, and tangible book value per share was $28.56, an increase of $3.36, or 13% (not\nannualized), from June 30, 2024.

Such statements include, without limitation, references to the Company's predictions or expectations of future business\nor financial performance as well as its goals and objectives for future operations, financial and business trends, business prospects, and management's outlook or\nexpectations for earnings, revenues, expenses, capital levels, liquidity levels, asset quality or other future financial or business performance, strategies or\nexpectations. The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “estimate,” “target,” “project” and similar expressions, among others, generally identify forward-\nlooking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on various assumptions (some of which may be beyond the Company's control) and are subject to\nsignificant risks and uncertainties (which change over time) and other factors, including the impacts related to or resulting from bank failures and other economic\nand industry volatility, including potential increased regulatory requirements and costs and potential impacts to macroeconomic conditions, the uncertain effects\nof geopolitical instability, armed conflicts, public health crises, inflation, interest rates and actions taken in response thereto on our business, results of\noperations, capital and liquidity, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated. Such risks and uncertainties are discussed\nin detail in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2024, and other documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time.\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made, and the\nCompany disclaims any duty to revise or update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of\nthe Company for any reason, except as specifically required by law. As used in this presentation, the terms \"WSFS\", \"the Company\", \"registrant\", \"we\", \"us\", and\n\"our\" mean WSFS Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, unless the context indicates otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures:\nThis presentation contains financial measures determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP measures include Core Earnings Per Share (“EPS”), Core Net Income, Core Fee Revenue, Core Fee Revenue ratio, Core\nEfficiency ratio, Pre-provision Net Revenue (“PPNR”), Core PPNR, PPNR to average assets ratio, Core PPNR to average assets ratio, Core Return on Assets (“ROA”),\ncore net interest income, Core Net Interest Margin (“NIM”), Tangible Common Equity (“TCE”), tangible assets, Return on Average Tangible Common Equity\n(“ROTCE”), Core ROTCE, Core Fee Revenue, Core Fee Revenue ratio, net tangible income, tangible common book value (“TBV”), TBV excluding AOCI, coverage ratio\nincluding the remaining credit marks, and Effective AOCI. The Company’s management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide a greater understanding\nof ongoing operations, enhance comparability of results of operations with prior periods and show the effects of significant gains and charges in the periods\npresented. The Company’s management believes that investors may use these non-GAAP measures to analyze the Company’s financial performance without the\nimpact of unusual items or events that may obscure trends in the Company’s underlying performance. This non-GAAP data should be considered in addition to\nresults prepared in accordance with GAAP, and is not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.

Davidson & Co.\nJake Civiello; Janney Montgomery Scott LLC\nRussell Gunther; Stephens Inc.\nPresentation:\nOperator: Thank you for standing by and welcome to the WSFS Financial Corporation Third Quarter\nEarnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Rodger Levenson, Chairman,\nPresident, and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin.\nRodger Levenson: Thank you, Ron, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. Before we get\nstarted, I wanted to officially introduce the newest member of our executive leadership team, Executive Vice\nPresident and CFO, David Burg. As many of you know, David joined WSFS in mid-August, following a 17-\nyear career at Citigroup. During his short tenure with WSFS, he has demonstrated the leadership and skills\nto accelerate our growth and deliver shareholder value. We're thrilled to have him on the team. David?\nDavid Burg: Thank you, Rodger, and thank you, everyone, for joining our third quarter 2024 earnings call.\nOur Earnings Release and Earnings Release Supplement, which we will refer to on today's call, can be found\nin the Investor Relations section of our company website.\nIn addition to Rodger Levenson, our Chairman, President and CEO, I'm joined by Art Bacci, Chief Operating\nOfficer; Steve Clark, Chief Commercial Banking Officer; and Shari Kruzinski, Chief Consumer Banking\nOfficer.\nPrior to reviewing our financial results, I would like to read our safe harbor statement. Our discussion today\nwill include information about management's view of our future expectations, plans and prospects that\nconstitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from historical results or those\nindicated by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to,\nthe risk factors included in our annual report on Form 10-K, our most recent quarterly reports on Form 10-\nQ, as well as other documents we periodically file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All\ncomments made during today's call are subject to the safe harbor statement.\nI will now turn to our financial results. WSFS continued to demonstrate the strength of our franchise and\ndiverse business model during the third quarter. Results included a core EPS of $1.08 per share, core ROA\nof 1.22%, and core return on tangible common equity of 16.96%.\nLoans and deposits increased 5% and 3%, respectively, on an annualized basis. Growth in loans was broad-\nbased, and our deposits remain well diversified. Our loan-to-deposit ratio was 80% on September 30,\nproviding ample balance sheet flexibility and capacity to fund future growth. Core fee revenue of $90.1\nmillion was up 5% linked quarter and 23% year over year. Wealth Management fee revenue declined 3%\nlinked quarter but increased 12% over the third quarter of '23.\nThe third quarter was driven by strong results in Institutional Services, offset by seasonally lower fees in\nPrivate Wealth and the Bryn Mawr Trust Company of Delaware. Notably, this quarter also marks the\nsuccessful completion of our trust accounting system conversion as well as the rollout of upgraded client\naccount portal in accordance with our Bryn Mawr Trust integration plan, which positions us well for future\ngrowth.\nCash Connect® increased 3% linked quarter and 50% over the third quarter of '23, driven by increased\nbailment revenues as we captured market share over the past year. This, combined with the continued\noptimization of its units and funding mix, drove an ROA of 1.29% in the third quarter. Core banking\nincreased 25% over the prior quarter, primarily due to an annual earn-out payment from the previously\nannounced sale of Spring EQ, and an increase in bank-owned life insurance revenue. As noted in our Earnings\nRelease, we have achieved our 2024 origination goal with Spring EQ, and do not expect new originations in\nthe fourth quarter. We're currently evaluating 2025 volumes with the company.\nCore non-interest expense of $163.7 million was up 5% linked quarter, driven by unfunded loan commitment\nreserves, higher loan workout costs, and compensation-related expenses to support future franchise growth.\nNet interest income grew 2% linked quarter, and the net interest margin was 3.78%, down 7 basis points\nfrom 2Q '24. Our net interest margin was impacted by growth in higher-priced deposits as we took advantage\nof market opportunities to grow share as well as the impact of market value increases in our available-for-\nsale investment portfolio.\nTotal net credit cost of $20.1 million increased modestly compared to the prior quarter, with a decrease in\nthe provision for credit losses, offset by an increase in reserves for unfunded commitments and loan workout\ncosts. Non-performing assets increased 12 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 44 basis points, primarily\ndriven by the migration of two previously identified and unrelated problem loans. Net charge-offs increased\n14 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 58 basis points, primarily driven by the write-down of one of the\npreviously mentioned non-performing loans, and year-to-date charge-off levels are in line with our\nexpectations.\nTotal stockholders' equity increased 8% linked quarter, driven by market value increases and available-for-\nsale investment securities and quarterly earnings. As a result, our book value per share increased 8% linked\nquarter to $45.37, and our tangible book value per share increased 13% linked quarter to $28.56.\nOn the last page of the Supplement, we provided an update to our full-year outlook to reflect the 50-basis\npoints rate cut that occurred in September. As a reminder, our previous mid-year outlook did not reflect any\nrate cuts for 2024. Our outlook for loans, deposits, fee revenue growth, and efficiency ratio remains\nunchanged from the prior outlook. We updated our outlook for net interest margin, and now expect our full-\nyear NIM to be approximately 3.80%, which is at the lower end of the range from our previous outlook that\ndid not include any rate cuts. In addition, we updated our estimate for 4Q NIM to be 3.70% to 3.75%.\nWith respect to net charge-offs, we have reduced the outlook for the year to approximately 50 basis points,\nwhich corresponds to the low end of our previous range. And lastly, we updated our outlook for ROA to a\nrange of 1.20% to 1.25%. This change is consistent with the sensitivity that we provided previously, that\neach 25-basis points reduction in the Fed funds rate would reduce ROA by approximately 3 basis points on\nan annualized basis. While the path of future rates remains uncertain, it's important to note that the impact of\nadditional rate cuts on our financial results will not be linear and will be affected by the pace of future rate\ncuts, deposit pricing, the impact of our hedge program, and the behavior of our securities portfolio.\nAs we have done in the past, we will provide a full-year Outlook for 2025 in January, with the release of our\nfourth quarter 2024 financial results.\nIn summary, despite the economic uncertainty, WSFS continues to grow and deliver strong results in the\nthird quarter. We remain well positioned to execute on our strategy and produce top-tier performance for the\nfull year. Equally important, our liquidity and capital position provides a cushion to absorb any unexpected\nchallenges that we might face.\nThank you, and we will now open the line for questions.\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Russell Gunther, Stephens.\nRussell Gunther: I appreciate the update to margin expectation, and understand we'll hold off on 2025. But\nif we could take a stab at thinking through the hedge program, as well as just what you would expect per 25\nbasis point hike impact to the NIM would be?\nDavid Burg: Sure, Russell. Happy to do that. And Russell, before doing that, I just want to back up a little\nbit and talk about our NIM versus the prior quarter. As you know, we had a reduction of 7 basis points.\nAnd when you think about that 7 basis points, you can kind of break it down in a few different categories.\nOne was due to the write-up of our investment portfolio. So just purely math, about 2 basis points. We had a\nlittle tick-up in non-accruals, which was 2 basis points, and then higher deposit costs was 3 basis points. And\nobviously, that higher deposit cost is moderating. The rate of that increase is moderating.\nSo, when you think about the hedge program that you mentioned, we had $1.2 billion completed last quarter.\nAs you know, the program was initially -- the strategy was for $1.5 billion. We completed the whole\nprogram this quarter. So, we now have about $1.5 billion completed, and those are floor options, and they're\nbasically 6 months forward with a 30-month term. And they start -- they basically strike at different levels.\nThey kick in at different levels, but the first one starts to kick in at around 4.75%.\nSo, I think the way to think about the hedge program is obviously that it's a mitigant to the asset sensitivity\nthat we have. And so, as we continue to go through the cycle, if we have additional cuts, that will mitigate\nsome of the sensitivity that we provided. We provided -- our previous guidance, as you know, was about 5\nbasis points of NIM for 25 basis points of rate cut, and these hedges will mitigate that effect somewhat.\nRussell Gunther: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you for the answer. And then switching gears to the fee\nside. Another really strong quarter out of that credit, debit, ATM revenue fee item. As you guys look ahead\nto the fourth quarter and the potential for additional Fed cuts, how do you see that line-item trending linked\nquarter?\nAnd then as we maybe broad stroke take a step to thinking about '25, a lot of market share and unique\nmarket share gains occurred in '24. What's a decent type of growth rate for that fee revenue item?\nDavid Burg: Yeah. So, with respect to that line item, particularly Cash Connect®, as you said, there were\nsignificant market share gains this year. The focus of that business is to now optimize that network and\nreally drive some efficiency in that network. Some of the decline that we saw on the pre-tax margin this\nquarter was related to idle cash, so cash that was non-earning. So, we really need to optimize that network to\nmake sure that we drive the profitability into that business.\nIn terms of 2025 and the impact of interest rates in that business, from a top line perspective, remember, that\nbusiness does charge based on the cash that is out in the ATMs. So, we will see a decline in top line revenue,\nbut we will see an equal decline or more decline in expenses. So, when you think about our profitability, we\nshould have higher profitability expansion in the down cycle for that business, even though the top line will\nsee declines just based on interest rates coming down.\nRussell Gunther: Okay. All right. Got it. Super helpful. And then just last one for me, guys, would be the\nimpact of Spring EQ revenue on the fee income this quarter?\nDavid Burg: Yeah. So, with Spring EQ, this was -- as a result of the previously announced sale, we had a\nnumber of provisions in the contract where we had earn-outs depending on achieving certain origination\nvolumes. Since we were able to achieve our volume for this year, we basically -- as a result, that resulted in\nthat earn-out of about $2 million. The future earn-outs, the potentially, maybe one next year, but it will\ndepend on the volume originations for that year. And that is something that is still -- that is under discussion\nnow.\nAs we mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we don't anticipate new originations. And, as a result of the sale,\nSpring EQ is evaluating its strategy going forward and its funding profile. And as a result, we're discussing\nwith them how 2025 is going to look. And we hope to provide an update on that in the January Outlook.\nRussell Gunther: Understood. Okay, great. Well, thanks guys for taking all of my questions. Very helpful.\nOperator: Kate Ashley, KBW.\nKate Ashley: Hi and good afternoon. This is Kate on for Kelly. So going back to the guide, so I appreciate\nthat the charge-offs are lower than what was previously expected, but also mentioned some lumpiness from\nthe Commercial charge-offs. So, with that move to NPA, like how should we be thinking about potential\nrelated NCOs off that?\nDavid Burg: Yeah, Kate, I think the way to think about -- even though we had a tick up in some of our\ncredit metrics, I think what's important to appreciate is that the impacts for this quarter were really driven by\nseveral problem loans across a few relationships. And these relationships were not a surprise to us, but ones\nthat we have been monitoring, they have been in our problem assets, and ones that we're working on\nconstructively with the sponsors towards a path to resolution. And so, these are not necessarily surprises, but\nthese are the impacts of some of those credits working their way through the cycle. And that's why -- so\nbasically, the net charge-offs this quarter were really driven by two C&I loans on the Commercial side, one\nwas a suburban hotel property in suburban Philadelphia and another C&I credit in our footprint. And that\nwas really kind of the uptick on the charge-off level.\nAnd that's why we feel comfortable reducing our guide for the full year to the low end of the range, again,\nbecause these were expected. We saw these coming, and I think they don't present surprises to us. So, as you\nknow, the first half of the year, in terms of Commercial charge-offs, was pretty low. We actually had a net\nrelease in the first quarter. And we knew that these were going to be uneven, and so now you're seeing some\nof that pipeline coming through the process.\nKate Ashley: Great. Thank you. That's it for me. I'll step back.\nOperator: Manuel Navas, D.A. Davidson.\nSharanjit Cheema: This is Sharanjit on for Manuel. And I was wondering what deposit betas are expected\non the way down, and there were approximately 36% on the way up. And what have you done so far since\nSeptember in terms of rate cuts?\nDavid Burg: Yeah. So, on your second question first, we've been pretty proactive about this. We -- even a\nlittle bit ahead of the rate cut, we reduced our CD pricing, and we brought in our, we had an 11-month CD\nproduct, which is our main product. We reduced pricing in that. And then we've also shortened the tenor on\nthat from 11 months to 6 months.\nWe have a number of CDs, and about $700 million that are indexed that would reprice automatically. And\nthen we have about $4.5 billion that are high-yield or money market CDs at the higher price points, and\nwe've started taking actions on all of those. And so, we're working with each of those clients, and we're\nmoving that portfolio. On the way down, as you said, our volume -- our interest-bearing beta was 51, our all\nin was in the mid-30s, as you mentioned. And clearly, looking at the deposit costs that we have, there will be\na lag on the way down.\nBut we plan to be very proactive about this. I think our beta in the near term for these 50 basis points of cuts\nwill be somewhere in the high teens or 20% for the fourth quarter. But the future beta for '25 will be highly\ndependent on the future, on how quickly those other rate cuts come and if they come. So, if we have a pause,\nthat's one scenario. If we have a number of other rate cuts in rapid succession, that's a very different\nscenario, and allows us to be more aggressive.\nBut I would say the other thing that I wanted to point out is that we do have some disruption in our market\nfrom competitor dynamics. And we see the opportunity to pick up share and pick up clients. And so that's\nalso something that we want to do with respect to our deposits. So, we're not, we're really not trying to\nmanage for one quarter, but we're trying to manage for strategic market share gains, and that's how we'll\nbehave and strategize about this.\nSharanjit Cheema: Okay. Thank you. And then for my last question, how are your Commercial loan\npipelines looking right now?\nSteve Clark: Yeah. This is Steve Clark. The Commercial pipeline is consistent with past quarters. So, our\n90-day weighted average is running at about $230 million, and that's what we expect in the near term in\nterms of closings. On top of that, we have Commercial businesses in our small business unit, our SBA unit,\nand our private banking teams, that would be in addition to that. But generally, we are pleased with our\npipeline, and it remains consistent, which is good news as we have shown pretty decent mid-single-digit\ngrowth throughout the year.\nSharanjit Cheema: Great. Thank you. Perfect. I'll step back.\nOperator: Frank Schiraldi, Piper Sandler.\nFrank Schiraldi: Hey, guys. Just wanted to go back to credit for a second. I totally get when I look at\nNPAs, delinquencies, net charge-offs linked quarter, that is really just driven by a couple of credits.\nHowever, you mentioned that those -- I think the credits were already in the problem asset base. And I'm just\ntrying to get a sense for what the main driver is in terms of the growth in problem assets linked quarter.\nDavid Burg: Yeah. Frank, I think what I would say in terms of problem assets is that -- we have -- I think as\nwe mentioned before, we have a pretty robust process where we look forward two years, we look at all of\nour maturities, we look at the underlying cash flows and we really evaluate the entire portfolio. And I think\nwe try to take a very rigorous approach looking at cash flows, looking in the environment, continuously\nupdating our valuations. So, I think -- I would say this is, I think, an indication more of a process rigor rather\nthan a bad omen in the portfolio. And to give you an example, I mean, one of the increases this quarter was\ndriven by a relationship where there are some specific short-term challenges.\nBut when we look at the collateral, it's -- we think that even based on updated valuations, we're at 50% to\n60% of the value. So, I think that's just an example of something that's there. But I think again, more an\nindication of our process.\nRodger Levenson: Yeah. Frank, I'll just maybe just put a little more numbers around it. If you really look at\nthe growth in the criticized loans, the problem loan category, there's three credits made up almost 70% of it.\nIt was one larger relationship that David referred to, where our projects are very solid, but there's some stress\nin the sponsor's global cash flow that we're working through collaboratively. And another project that we\nhave, a long-time Customer, where there's some slowness in some leasing up of a completed construction\nproject. That's really the driver of that pop that you see in the problem loans.\nFrank Schiraldi: Okay. Thanks for that color. And then just in terms of -- I don't know if you want to put a\ntoo fine a point on it. I know in the past; you talked about the 5 basis points of NIM compression for a given\n25 basis point rate cut. Obviously, there's some mitigation here with this hedging program. I don't know if\nyou wanted to put a number around adjusted for the hedges, what that could potentially look like going\nforward or if that's something your 2025 to do?\nDavid Burg: Yeah, Frank, I think we'll do that in 2025. But again, I think the important thing is the non-\nlinearity of it. And our hedges start at 4.75% and the lower we go, the more of an impact that is, that's\nnumber one. So, I think we want to see a little bit how the cuts play out. Number two, obviously, the point I\nmentioned about pricing and our ability to be more aggressive depending on how many cuts come.\nAnd number three is also with respect to our securities portfolio, that's an important mitigant to the asset\nsensitivity on the downside because as you know, that portfolio kicks off about $500 million of cash a year\nthat we redeploy at about 4.5% higher. And so, depending on how far rates go, you may have accelerated\npaydowns because that's mostly the MBS portfolio. So, you also may have accelerated paydowns, and we\nhave a large pickup as rates come down there. So, I think there are a few puts and takes there and really\ndependent on the trajectory of rates, and that's why I think it makes sense for us to give that Outlook next\nyear as we see a little bit more about how things play out. So, I think that 5 basis points was more for the\nfirst few cuts, rather than something that you can extrapolate to the whole cycle.\nFrank Schiraldi: Okay. And then just lastly, I just wanted to ask about capital. In terms of your profitability\nand growth trajectory, understanding the priority is organic growth, and you've done two larger-sized deals,\nstill not too far in the rearview mirror. Just wondering if there's any updated thoughts around the potential,\nwhat you guys are -- as you look at the environment today, of further bank M&A?\nRodger Levenson: Hey Frank, it's Rodger. I think you really hit on all the important points. We're seeing\ngreat progress on the optimization of the two big investments. If you look through last year and the first\nthree quarters of this year, pretty consistently growing loans, deposits, fee income, and taking market share.\nBut as you know, we were starting from a very low bottom.\nSo, we think there is a -- in terms of our position in the market more broadly. So, we think there's still a lot\nof runway there to go. And as David said, particularly when you see some of the distractions that are going\non in some of the larger players in our market. In addition to that, we continue to heavily invest in talent,\nthat's somewhat reflected in the NIE. And if you look at the year-over-year adds to staff that we've had\nacross the organization, about two-thirds of those are in business-generating lines of business.\nAgain, we're seeing opportunities that we've talked about to pick up talent from other organizations. So, we\nare investing very heavily in the business. We'll always keep an eye out for things that would be\nopportunistic that could help support those activities. But I would reiterate that the bar for that for us would\nbe very, very high because it would have to be considered in light of how that would impact our ability to\ncontinue to execute on the organic opportunity.\nSo, we're running hard at it. We'll see what comes along, but our focus continues to be primarily on organic\ngrowth, from a bank standpoint.\nFrank Schiraldi: Great. Okay. Appreciate all the color. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: And with no further questions in queue, I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Burg.\nDavid Burg: Thank you very much and thank you all for joining the call today. If you have any specific\nfollow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to Andrew or me. Rodger, Art, and I will be attending\nconferences and investor meetings throughout the quarter, and we look forward to meeting with many of you\nduring the quarter. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now\ndisconnect."

NONINTEREST INCOME\nCredit/debit card and ATM income\nThe following table presents the components of credit/debit card and ATM income:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBailment fees $ 19,616 $ 9,982 $ 53,399 $ 28,051\nInterchange fees 4,046 3,885 11,770 11,764\nOther card and ATM fees 959 1,002 2,996 2,845\nTotal credit/debit card and ATM income $ 24,621 $ 14,869 $ 68,165 $ 42,660\nCredit/debit card and ATM income is composed of bailment fees, interchange fees, and other card and ATM fees. Bailment fees\nare earned from bailment arrangements with customers. Bailment arrangements are legal relationships in which property is\ndelivered to another party without a transfer of ownership. The party who transferred the property (the bailor) retains ownership\ninterest of the property. In the event that the bailee files for bankruptcy protection, the property is not included in the bailee's\nassets. The bailee pays an agreed-upon fee for the use of the bailor's property in exchange for the bailor allowing use of the\nassets at the bailee's site. Bailment fees are earned from cash that is made available for customers' use at an offsite location,\nsuch as cash located in an ATM at a customer's place of business. These fees are typically indexed to a market interest rate.\nThis revenue stream generates fee income through monthly billing for bailment services.\nCredit/debit card and ATM income also includes interchange fees. Interchange fees are paid by a merchant's bank to a bank that\nissued a debit or credit card used in a transaction to compensate the issuing bank for the value and benefit the merchant receives\nfrom accepting electronic payments. These revenue streams generate fee income at the time a transaction occurs and are\nrecorded as revenue at the time of the transaction.\nInvestment management and fiduciary income\nThe following table presents the components of investment management and fiduciary income:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nTrust fees $ 25,295 $ 22,062 $ 73,299 $ 64,514\nWealth management and advisory fees 11,353 10,658 33,883 31,061\nTotal investment management and fiduciary income $ 36,648 $ 32,720 $ 107,182 $ 95,575\nInvestment management and fiduciary income is composed of trust fees and wealth management and advisory fees. Trust fees\nare based on revenue earned from custody, escrow, trustee and trustee related services on structured finance transactions;\nindenture trustee, administrative agent and collateral agent services to individuals, institutions and corporations; commercial\ndomicile and independent director services; and investment and trustee services to families and individuals. Most fees are flat\nfees, except for a portion of personal and corporate trustee fees where the Company earns a percentage on the assets under\nmanagement or assets held within a trust. This revenue stream primarily generates fee income through monthly, quarterly and\nannual billings for services provided.\nWealth management and advisory fees consists of fees from Bryn Mawr Trust (excluding BMT-DE), BMCM, Powdermill®,\nand WSFS Wealth® Investments. Wealth management and advisory fees are based on revenue earned from services including\nasset management, financial planning, family office, and brokerage. The fees are based on the market value of assets, are\nassessed as a flat fee, or are brokerage commissions. This revenue stream primarily generates fee income through monthly,\nquarterly and annual billings for the services.\n14\nTable of Contents\nDeposit service charges\nThe following table presents the components of deposit service charges:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nService fees $ 4,649 $ 4,382 $ 13,533 $ 12,833\nReturn and overdraft fees 1,867 1,851 5,315 5,218\nOther deposit service fees 321 301 972 799\nTotal deposit service charges $ 6,837 $ 6,534 $ 19,820 $ 18,850\nDeposit service charges includes revenue earned from core deposit products, certificates of deposit, and brokered deposits. The\nCompany generates fee revenues from deposit service charges primarily through service charges and overdraft fees. Service\ncharges consist primarily of monthly account maintenance fees, treasury management fees, foreign ATM fees and other\nmaintenance fees. All of these revenue streams generate fee income through service charges for monthly account maintenance\nand similar items, transfer fees, late fees, overlimit fees, and stop payment fees. Revenue is recorded at the time of the\ntransaction.\nOther income\nThe following table presents the components of other income:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nManaged service fees $ 5,529 $ 5,301 $ 16,976 $ 15,316\nCurrency preparation 1,915 1,331 5,514 3,955\nATM loss protection 834 643 2,577 1,938\nCapital markets revenue 3,371 3,581 9,750 8,170\nMiscellaneous products and services 5,227 3,122 11,237 4,381\nTotal other income $ 16,876 $ 13,978 $ 46,054 $ 33,760\nOther income consists of managed service fees, which are primarily courier fees related to treasury management and are\npartially offset in noninterest expense, currency preparation, ATM loss protection, capital markets revenue, and other\nmiscellaneous products and services offered by the Bank. These fees are primarily generated through monthly billings or at the\ntime of the transaction. Capital markets revenue consists of fees related to interest rate swaps, risk participation agreements,\nforeign exchange contracts, letters of credit, and trade finance products and services offered by the Bank.\nArrangements with multiple performance obligations\nThe Company's contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, the Company\nallocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The Company generally\ndetermines standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\nPractical expedients and exemptions\nThe Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected\nlength of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to\ninvoice for services performed.\nSee Note 14 for further information about the disaggregation of noninterest income by segment.\n15\nTable of Contents\n4.

The total outstanding balance on these loans was $3.2\nmillion and $1.1 million, respectively.

Loan workout and OREO expenses are\nincluded in Loan workout and other credit costs on the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Income.\nCredit Quality Indicators\nBelow is a description of each of the risk ratings for all commercial loans:\n• Pass. These borrowers currently show no indication of deterioration or potential problems and their loans are considered\nfully collectible.\n• Special Mention. These borrowers have potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention. Borrowers in this\ncategory may be experiencing adverse operating trends, for example, declining revenues or margins, high leverage, tight\nliquidity, or increasing inventory without increasing sales. These adverse trends can have a potential negative effect on the\nborrower’s repayment capacity. These assets are not adversely classified and do not expose the Bank to significant risk that\nwould warrant a more severe rating. Borrowers in this category may also be experiencing significant management\nproblems, pending litigation, or other structural credit weaknesses.\n• Substandard or Lower. These borrowers have well-defined weaknesses that require extensive oversight by management.\nBorrowers in this category may exhibit one or more of the following: inadequate debt service coverage, unprofitable\noperations, insufficient liquidity, high leverage, and weak or inadequate capitalization. Relationships in this category are\nnot adequately protected by the sound financial worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged on the\nloan, if any. A distinct possibility exists that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. In\naddition, some borrowers in this category could have the added characteristic that the possibility of loss is extremely\nhigh. Current circumstances in the credit relationship make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable. Such\nimpending events include: perfecting liens on additional collateral, obtaining collateral valuations, an acquisition or\nliquidation preceding, proposed merger, or refinancing plan.\nResidential and Consumer Loans\nThe residential and consumer loan portfolios are monitored on an ongoing basis using delinquency information and loan type as\ncredit quality indicators. These credit quality indicators are assessed in the aggregate in these relatively homogeneous\nportfolios. Loans that are greater than 90 days past due are generally considered nonperforming and placed on nonaccrual\nstatus.\n25\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables provide an analysis of loans by

FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820-10) defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or\npaid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820-10\nestablishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation methodologies into the following three\nlevels:\n• Level 1: Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices, unadjusted, for identical assets or liabilities in active\nmarkets. A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and shall be used to\nmeasure fair value whenever available.\n• Level 2: Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;\ninputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that\nare not active; or inputs to the valuation methodology that are derived principally from or can be corroborated by\nobservable market data by correlation or other means.\n• Level 3: Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Level 3\nassets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using discounted cash flow\nmethodologies, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management\njudgment or estimation.\n36\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present financial instruments carried at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 by\nlevel in the valuation hierarchy (as described above):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nQuoted\nPrices in\nActive Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable\nAsset Inputs Inputs Total Fair\n(Dollars in thousands) (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Value\nAssets measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nAvailable-for-sale securities:\nCMO $ — $ 455,483 $ — $ 455,483\nFNMA MBS — 2,939,887 — 2,939,887\nFHLMC MBS — 111,807 — 111,807\nGNMA MBS — 43,823 — 43,823\nGSE agency notes — 186,119 — 186,119\nOther assets — 166,339 56 166,395\nTotal assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis $ — $ 3,903,458 $ 56 $ 3,903,514\nLiabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nOther liabilities $ — $ 133,020 $ 8,285 $ 141,305\nAssets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:\nOther investments $ — $ — $ 14,322 $ 14,322\nOther real estate owned — — 1,301 1,301\nLoans held for sale — 42,121 — 42,121\nTotal assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis $ — $ 42,121 $ 15,623 $ 57,744\nDecember 31, 2023\nQuoted\nPrices in\nActive Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable\nAsset Inputs Inputs Total Fair\n(Dollars in thousands) (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Value\nAssets measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nAvailable-for-sale securities:\nCMO $ — $ 464,619 $ — $ 464,619\nFNMA MBS — 3,042,350 — 3,042,350\nFHLMC MBS — 115,532 — 115,532\nGNMA MBS — 43,340 — 43,340\nGSE agency notes — 180,696 — 180,696\nOther assets — 153,569 78 153,647\nTotal assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis $ — $ 4,000,106 $ 78 $ 4,000,184\nLiabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nOther liabilities $ — $ 137,616 $ 14,026 $ 151,642\nAssets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\nOther investments $ — $ — $ 15,206 $ 15,206\nOther real estate owned — — 1,569 1,569\nLoans held for sale — 29,268 — 29,268\nTotal assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis $ — $ 29,268 $ 16,775 $ 46,043\n37\nTable of Contents\nFair value is based on quoted market prices, where available. If such quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based\non internally developed models or obtained from third parties that primarily use, as inputs, observable market-based parameters.\nValuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value. These adjustments may\ninclude unobservable parameters. The Company's valuation methodologies may produce a fair value calculation that may not be\nindicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. While the Company believes its valuation methodologies are\nappropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the\nfair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nSecurities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value using Level 2 inputs. The Company believes that this Level 2\ndesignation is appropriate under ASC 820-10, as these securities are GSEs and GNMA securities with almost all fixed income\nsecurities, none are exchange traded, and all are priced by correlation to observed market data. For these securities the\nCompany obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider\nobservable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, U.S. government and agency yield curves, live\ntrading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information, and the security’s terms and\nconditions, among other factors.\nOther investments\nOther investments includes equity investments without readily determinable fair values, which are categorized as Level 3. The\nCompany’s equity investments without readily determinable fair values are held at cost, and are adjusted for any observable\nprice changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer during the reporting period.\nOther real estate owned\nOther real estate owned consists of loan collateral which has been repossessed through foreclosure or other measures. Initially,\nforeclosed assets are recorded at the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs. Subsequent to foreclosure,\nvaluations are updated periodically and the assets may be marked down further, reflecting a new cost basis. The fair value of\nother real estate owned was estimated using Level 3 inputs based on appraisals obtained from third parties.\nLoans held for sale\nThe fair value of loans held for sale is based on estimates using Level 2 inputs. These inputs are based on pricing information\nobtained from wholesale mortgage banks and brokers and applied to loans with similar interest rates and maturities.\nOther assets\nOther assets include the fair value of interest rate products, derivatives on the residential mortgage held for sale loan pipeline,\nforeign exchange forward contracts, and risk participation agreements. Valuation of interest rate products is obtained from an\nindependent pricing service and also from the derivative counterparty. Valuation of the derivative related to the residential\nmortgage held for sale loan pipeline is based on valuation of the loans held for sale portfolio as described above in Loans held\nfor sale. Valuation of foreign exchange forward contracts and risk participation agreements are obtained from an independent\npricing service.\nOther liabilities\nOther liabilities include the fair value of interest rate products, derivatives on the residential mortgage held for sale loan\npipeline, foreign exchange forward contracts, risk participation agreements, and derivative related to the sale of certain Visa\nClass B common shares. Valuation of interest rate products is obtained from an independent pricing service and also from the\nderivative counterparty. Valuation of the derivative related to the residential mortgage held for sale loan pipeline is based on\nvaluation of the loans held for sale portfolio as described above in Loans held for sale. Valuation of foreign exchange forward\ncontracts and risk participation agreements are obtained from an independent pricing service. Valuation of the derivative related\nto the sale of certain Visa Class B common shares is based on: (i) the agreed upon graduated fee structure; (ii) the length of time\nuntil the resolution of the Visa covered litigation; and (iii) the estimated impact of dilution in the conversion ratio of Class B\nshares resulting from changes in the Visa covered litigation.\n38\nTable of Contents\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe reported fair values of financial instruments are based on a variety of factors. In certain cases, fair values represent quoted\nmarket prices for identical or comparable instruments. In other cases, fair values have been estimated based on assumptions\nregarding the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows that are discounted to reflect current market rates and varying\ndegrees of risk. Accordingly, the fair values may not represent actual values of the financial instruments that could have been\nrealized as of period-end or that will be realized in the future.\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it\nis practicable to estimate that value:\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\nFor cash and short-term investment securities, including due from banks, federal funds sold or purchased under agreements to\nresell and interest-bearing deposits with other banks, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.\nInvestment securities\nInvestment securities include debt securities classified as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Fair value is estimated using\nquoted prices for similar securities, which the Company obtains from a third party vendor. The Company uses one of the largest\nproviders of securities pricing to the industry and management periodically assesses the inputs used by this vendor to price the\nvarious types of securities owned by the Company to validate the vendor’s methodology as described above in available-for-\nsale securities.\nOther investments\nOther investments includes equity investments without readily determinable fair values (see discussion in “Fair Value of\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities” section above) as well as equity method investments.\nLoans held for sale\nLoans held for sale are carried at their fair value (see discussion in “Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities” section\nabove).\nLoans and leases\nLoans and leases are segregated by portfolio segments with similar financial characteristics. The fair values of loans and leases,\nwith the exception of reverse mortgages, are estimated by discounting expected cash flows using the current rates at which\nsimilar loans would be made to borrowers with comparable credit ratings and for similar remaining maturities. The fair values\nof reverse mortgages are based on the net present value of the expected cash flows using a discount rate specific to the reverse\nmortgages portfolio. The fair value of nonperforming loans is based on recent external appraisals of the underlying collateral, if\nthe loan is collateral dependent. Estimated cash flows, discounted using a rate commensurate with current rates and the risk\nassociated with the estimated cash flows, are used if appraisals are not available. This technique does contemplate an exit price.\nStock in the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Pittsburgh\nThe fair value of FHLB stock is assumed to be equal to its cost basis, since the stock is non-marketable but redeemable at its par\nvalue.\nAccrued interest receivable\nThe carrying amounts of interest receivable approximate fair value.\nOther assets\nOther assets include the fair value of interest rate products, derivatives on the residential mortgage held for sale loan pipeline,\nforeign exchange forward contracts, and risk participation agreements (see discussion in “Fair Value of Financial Assets and\nLiabilities” section above).\nDeposits\nThe fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as noninterest-bearing demand deposits, money market and interest-\nbearing demand deposits, is assumed to be equal to the amount payable on demand. The fair value of time deposits is based on\nthe discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using rates currently offered for deposits with\ncomparable remaining maturities.\n39\nTable of Contents\nBorrowed funds\nRates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate the fair\nvalue of existing debt.\nOff-balance sheet instruments\nThe fair value of off-balance sheet instruments, including swap guarantees of $6.0 million at September 30, 2024 and $7.3\nmillion at December 31, 2023, respectively, and standby letters of credit, approximates the recorded net deferred fee amounts.\nBecause letters of credit are generally not assignable by either the Company or the borrower, they only have value to the\nCompany and the borrower. In determining the fair value of the swap guarantees, the Company assesses the underlying credit\nrisk exposure for each borrower in a paying position to the third-party financial institution.\nAccrued interest payable\nThe carrying amounts of interest payable approximate fair value.\nOther liabilities\nOther liabilities include the fair value of interest rate products, derivatives on the residential mortgage held for sale loan\npipeline, foreign exchange forward contracts, risk participation agreements, and derivative related to the sale of certain Visa\nClass B common shares (see discussion in “Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities” section above).\nFinancial instruments measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3)\nThe following tables provide a description of the valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs for the Company's\nfinancial instruments classified as Level 3 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n(Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024\nRange\nFinancial Instrument Fair Value Valuation Technique(s) Unobservable Input (Weighted Average)\nObserved market\ncomparable Period of observed\nOther investments $ 14,322 transactions transactions December 2023\nFair market value of\nOther real estate owned 1,301 collateral Costs to sell 10.0%-20.0% (19.3%)\nCDS spread: 110 - 360 bps (189\nOther assets (Risk participation Credit Valuation CDS Spread and Loss bps)\nagreements purchased) 56 Adjustment Given Default (LGD) LGD: –% - 30% (30%)\nCDS spread: 1 - 250 bps (213\nOther liabilities (Risk Credit Valuation CDS Spread and Loss bps)\nparticipation agreements sold) 112 Adjustment Given Default (LGD) LGD: 30%\nOther liabilities (Financial\nderivative related to sales of Timing of Visa\ncertain Visa Class B shares) 8,173 Discounted cash flow litigation resolution 2.75 years or 2Q 2027\n(Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2023\nRange\nFinancial Instrument Fair Value Valuation Technique(s) Unobservable Input (Weighted Average)\nObserved market Period of observed\nOther investments $ 15,206 comparable transactions transactions December 2023\nFair market value of\nOther real estate owned 1,569 collateral Costs to sell 10.0% - 20.0% (18.1%)\nCDS spread: 110 - 360 bps (195\nOther assets (Risk participation Credit Valuation CDS Spread and Loss bps)\nagreements purchased) 78 Adjustment Given Default (LGD) LGD: –% - 30% (30%)\nOther liabilities (Risk participation Credit Valuation CDS Spread and Loss CDS spread: 1 - 250 bps (95 bps)\nagreements sold) 3 Adjustment Given Default (LGD) LGD: 30%\nOther liabilities (Financial\nderivative related to sales of Timing of Visa litigation 1.00 - 4.75 years (3.06 years or\ncertain Visa Class B shares) 14,023 Discounted cash flow resolution 4Q 2025)\n40\nTable of Contents\nThe book value and estimated fair value of the Company's financial instruments are as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nFair Value\n(Dollars in thousands) Measurement Book Value Fair Value Book Value Fair Value\nFinancial assets:\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash Level 1 $ 990,918 $ 990,918 $ 1,092,900 $ 1,092,900\nInvestment securities available-for-sale Level 2 3,737,119 3,737,119 3,846,537 3,846,537\nInvestment securities held-to-maturity, net Level 2 1,026,305 958,969 1,058,557 985,931\nOther investments Level 3 16,976 16,976 17,434 17,434\nLoans, held for sale Level 2 42,121 42,121 29,268 29,268\nLoans and leases, net(1) Level 3 13,124,684 13,360,280 12,583,202 12,514,431\nStock in FHLB of Pittsburgh Level 2 17,497 17,497 15,398 15,398\nAccrued interest receivable Level 2 87,360 87,360 85,979 85,979\nOther assets Levels 2, 3 166,395 166,395 153,647 153,647\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits Level 2 $ 16,427,031 $ 16,418,398 $ 16,474,086 $ 16,449,198\nBorrowed funds Level 2 1,075,161 1,093,335 895,076 912,760\nStandby letters of credit Level 3 675 675 814 814\nAccrued interest payable Level 2 73,418 73,418 46,684 46,684\nOther liabilities Levels 2, 3 141,305 141,305 151,642 151,642\n(1) Includes reverse mortgage loans.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the Company had no commitments to extend credit measured at fair value.\n41\nTable of Contents\n13. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nRisk Management Objective of Using Derivatives\nThe Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both economic conditions and its business operations. The Company\nprincipally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business\nactivities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the\namount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities. The Company manages a matched book with respect to its derivative\ninstruments in order to minimize its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. The Company does not use derivative\nfinancial instruments for proprietary or speculative trading.\nFair Values of Derivative Instruments\nThe table below presents the fair value of derivative financial instruments as well as their location on the unaudited\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Condition as of September 30, 2024.\nFair Values of Derivative Instruments\nDerivatives\n(Dollars in thousands) Count Notional Balance Sheet Location (Fair Value)\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nInterest rate swaps 18 $ 1,500,000 Other assets $ 32,323\nTotal $ 1,500,000 $ 32,323\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nInterest rate swaps $ 2,875,981 Other assets $ 131,543\nInterest rate swaps 2,875,981 Other liabilities (131,543)\nInterest rate lock commitments with customers 67,991 Other assets 1,071\nInterest rate lock commitments with customers 390 Other liabilities (2)\nForward sale commitments 14,548 Other assets 42\nForward sale commitments 58,479 Other liabilities (258)\nFX forwards 34,636 Other assets 1,360\nFX forwards 33,204 Other liabilities (1,217)\nRisk participation agreements sold 102,449 Other liabilities (112)\nRisk participation agreements purchased 89,053 Other assets 56\nFinancial derivatives related to\nsales of certain Visa Class B shares 55,358 Other liabilities (8,173)\nTotal derivatives $ 7,708,070 $ 25,090\n42\nTable of Contents\nThe table below presents the fair value of derivative financial instruments as well as their location on the unaudited\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Condition as of December 31, 2023.\nFair Values of Derivative Instruments\nDerivatives\n(Dollars in thousands) Count Notional Balance Sheet Location (Fair Value)\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nInterest rate swaps 9 $ 750,000 Other assets $ 15,578\nTotal $ 750,000 $ 15,578\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nInterest rate swaps $ 2,428,306 Other assets $ 136,924\nInterest rate swaps 2,383,443 Other liabilities (136,924)\nInterest rate lock commitments with customers 34,651 Other assets 637\nForward sale commitments 1,000 Other assets 1\nForward sale commitments 37,348 Other liabilities (283)\nFX forwards 15,812 Other assets 429\nFX forwards 13,064 Other liabilities (409)\nRisk participation agreements sold 103,648 Other liabilities (3)\nRisk participation agreements purchased 116,804 Other assets 78\nFinancial derivatives related to\nsales of certain Visa Class B shares 113,177 Other liabilities (14,023)\nTotal derivatives $ 5,997,253 $ 2,005\nEffect of Derivative Instruments on the Income Statement\nThe table below presents the effect of the derivative financial instruments on the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Income\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\nAmount of Loss Recognized in Amount of Loss Recognized in Location of Loss Reclassified from\nOCI on Derivative (Effective OCI on Derivative (Effective Accumulated OCI into Income\nPortion) Portion) (Effective Portion)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(Dollars in thousands) September 30, September 30,\nDerivatives in Cash Flow\nHedging Relationships 2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest rate options $ 10,722 $ (1,608) $ 3,702 $ (2,752) Interest income\nTotal $ 10,722 $ (1,608) $ 3,702 $ (2,752)\nAmount of Gain (Loss) Amount of Gain (Loss) Location of Gain (Loss)\nRecognized in Income Recognized in Income Recognized in Income\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(Dollars in thousands) September 30, September 30,\nDerivatives not designated\nas hedging instruments 2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest rate swaps and\noptions $ 2,774 $ 3,427 $ 7,928 $ 7,397 Other income\nInterest rate lock\ncommitments with\ncustomers 143 (171) 399 116 Mortgage banking activities, net\nForward sale commitments (977) 595 (733) $ 660 Mortgage banking activities, net\nFX forwards 91 97 370 126 Other income\nRisk participation\nagreements (62) (317) (97) (330) Other income\nTotal $ 1,969 $ 3,631 $ 7,867 $ 7,969\n43\nTable of Contents\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments:\nCash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk\nThe Company's objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest income and to manage its exposure to\ninterest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate options, including floors, caps,\ncollars, or swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate options designated as cash flow hedges\ninvolve the receipt of fixed amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making variable-rate payments over the\nlife of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.\nThe Company has agreements with certain derivative counterparties that contain a provision under which, if it defaults on any\nof its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the\nCompany could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. The Company also has agreements with certain\nderivative counterparties that contain a provision where if it fails to maintain its status as a well-capitalized or adequately\ncapitalized institution, then the counterparty could terminate the derivative positions and the Company would be required to\nsettle its obligations under the agreements.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had 18 interest rate floors purchased at an aggregate premium of $29.7 million with an\naggregate notional amount of $1.5 billion to hedge variable cash flows associated with a variable rate loan pool through the\nthird quarter of 2027. Changes to the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged\nforecast transaction affects earnings. If the Company determines that a cash flow hedge is no longer highly effective, future\nchanges in the fair value of the hedging instrument would be reported in earnings. As of September 30, 2024, the Company\ndetermined the cash flow hedges remain highly effective. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, $1.3\nmillion and $3.1 million, respectively, of amortization expense on the premium was reclassified into interest income compared\nto $0.4 million and $0.6 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company does\nnot expect any unrealized gains or losses related to cash flow hedges to be reclassified into earnings in the next twelve months.\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:\nCustomer Derivatives – Interest Rate Swaps\nThe Company enters into interest rate swaps with commercial loan customers wishing to manage interest rate risk. The\nCompany then enters into corresponding swap agreements with swap dealer counterparties to economically hedge the exposure\narising from these contracts. The interest rate swaps with both the customers and third parties are not designated as hedges\nunder ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815) and are marked to market through earnings. As the interest rate swaps are\nstructured to offset each other, changes to the underlying benchmark interest rates considered in the valuation of these\ninstruments do not result in an impact to earnings; however, there may be fair value adjustments related to credit quality\nvariations between counterparties, which may impact earnings as required by ASC 820. As of September 30, 2024, there were\nno fair value adjustments related to credit quality.\nDerivative Financial Instruments from Mortgage Banking Activities\nDerivative financial instruments related to mortgage banking activities are recorded at fair value and are not designated as\naccounting hedges. This includes commitments to originate certain fixed-rate residential mortgage loans to customers, also\nreferred to as interest rate lock commitments. The Company may also enter into forward sale commitments to sell loans to\ninvestors at a fixed price at a future date and trade asset-backed securities to mitigate interest rate risk.\nForeign Exchange Forward Contracts\nThe Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts (FX forwards) with customers to exchange one currency for\nanother on an agreed date in the future at an agreed exchange rate. The Corporation then enters into corresponding FX forwards\nwith swap dealer counterparties to economically hedge its exposure on the exchange rate component of the customer\nagreements. The FX forwards with both the customers and third parties are not designated as hedges under ASC 815 and are\nmarked to market through earnings. Exposure to gains and losses on these contracts increase or decrease over their respective\nlives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate. As the FX forwards are structured to offset each other, changes to the\nunderlying term structure of currency exchange rates considered in the valuation of these instruments do not result in an impact\nto earnings; however, there may be fair value adjustments related to credit quality variations between counterparties, which may\nimpact earnings as required by ASC 820. As of September 30, 2024, there were no fair value adjustments related to credit\nquality.\n44\nTable of Contents\nRisk Participation Agreements\nThe Company may enter into a risk participation agreement (RPA) with another institution as a means to assume a portion of\nthe credit risk associated with a loan structure which includes a derivative instrument, in exchange for fee income\ncommensurate with the risk assumed. This type of derivative is referred to as an “RPA sold.” In addition, in an effort to reduce\nthe credit risk associated with an interest rate swap agreement with a borrower for whom the Corporation has provided a loan\nstructured with a derivative, the Corporation may purchase an RPA from an institution participating in the facility in exchange\nfor a fee commensurate with the risk shared. This type of derivative is referred to as an “RPA purchased.”\nSwap Guarantees\nThe Company entered into agreements with one unrelated financial institution whereby that financial institution entered into\ninterest rate derivative contracts (interest rate swap transactions) directly with customers referred to them by the\nCompany. Under the terms of the agreements, the financial institution has recourse to us for any exposure created under each\nswap transaction, only in the event that the customer defaults on the swap agreement and the agreement is in a paying position\nto the third-party financial institution. This is a customary arrangement that allows us to provide access to interest rate swap\ntransactions for our customers without creating the swap ourselves. These swap guarantees are accounted for as credit\nderivatives.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 161 and 188 variable-rate to fixed-rate swap transactions between\nthe third-party financial institutions and the Company's customers, respectively. The initial notional aggregate amount was\napproximately $0.7 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the swap transactions\nremaining maturities ranged from under 1 year to 11 years. At September 30, 2024, one of these customer swaps was in a\npaying position to third parties for less than $0.1 million, with our swap guarantees having a fair value of $6.0 million. At\nDecember 31, 2023, none of these customer swaps were in a paying position to third parties, with the Company's swap\nguarantees having a fair value of $7.3 million. For both periods, none of the Company's customers were in default of the swap\nagreements.\nCredit-risk-related Contingent Features\nThe Company has agreements with certain derivative counterparties that contain a provision under which, if it defaults on any\nof its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the\nCompany could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations.\nThe Company has minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of its derivative counterparties, and has posted collateral\nof $3.7 million in cash against its obligations under these agreements which meets or exceeds the minimum collateral posting\nrequirements. If the Company had breached any of these provisions at September 30, 2024, it could have been required to settle\nits obligations under the agreements at the termination value.\n45\nTable of Contents\n14.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nSecondary Market Loan Sales\nThe Company typically sells newly originated residential mortgage loans in the secondary market to mortgage loan aggregators\nand to GSEs such as FHLMC, FNMA, and on a more limited basis, the FHLB. Loans held for sale are reflected on the\nunaudited Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at fair value with changes in the value reflected in the unaudited\nConsolidated Statements of Income. Gains and losses are recognized at the time of sale. The Company periodically retains the\nservicing rights on residential mortgage loans sold which results in monthly service fee income. The mortgage servicing rights\nare included in Goodwill and intangible assets on the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Otherwise, the\nCompany sells loans with servicing released on a nonrecourse basis. Rate-locked loan commitments that the Company intends\nto sell in the secondary market are accounted for as derivatives under ASC 815.\nThe Company does not sell loans with recourse, except for standard loan sale contract provisions covering violations of\nrepresentations and warranties and, under certain circumstances, early payment default by the borrower. These are customary\nrepurchase provisions in the secondary market for residential mortgage loan sales. These provisions may include either an\nindemnification from loss or the repurchase of the loans. Repurchases and losses have been rare and no provision is made for\nlosses at the time of sale. There were three repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for an aggregate of\n$0.7 million and one repurchase for $0.8 million during the same period in 2023.\nUnfunded Lending Commitments\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses of unfunded lending commitments was $12.8\nmillion and $12.1 million, respectively. A provision expense of $1.3 million and $0.7 million was recognized during the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to a provision expense of $0.1 million and $0.2 million\nduring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\n49\nTable of Contents\n16. CHANGE IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss includes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments, unrealized gains\nand losses on cash flow hedges, as well as unrecognized prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit\npension plans.

LEGAL AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS\nIn accordance with the current accounting standards for loss contingencies, the Company establishes reserves for litigation-\nrelated matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities when it is probable that a loss associated with a claim or\nproceeding has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Litigation claims and proceedings of all\ntypes are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance. In addition, the Company's\ndefense of litigation claims may result in legal fees, which it expenses as incurred.\nThere were no material changes or additions to other significant pending legal or other proceedings involving the Company\nother than those arising out of routine operations.\n51\nTable of Contents\n18.

This increase\nwas primarily due to $199.5 million of earnings and a decrease of $94.0 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss\ndriven by market value increases on available-for-sale mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by $74.5 million from the\nrepurchase of shares of common stock under our stock repurchase plan and the payment of dividends on our common stock of\n$27.0 million.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per\nshare of common stock.

A depository institution’s capital\ntier depends on its capital levels in relation to various relevant capital measures, which include leverage and risk-based capital\nmeasures and certain other factors. Depository institutions that are not classified as well-capitalized are subject to various\nrestrictions, which may include restrictions on capital distributions, payment of management fees, acceptance of brokered\ndeposits and other operating activities.\nRegulatory capital requirements for the Bank and the Company include a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of\n4.50% of risk-weighted assets, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.00% of risk-weighted assets, a minimum total capital ratio of 8.00% of\nrisk-weighted assets and a minimum Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 4.00% of average assets. In order to avoid limits on capital\ndistributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Bank and the Company must maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%\nof common equity Tier 1 capital over each of the risk-based capital requirements. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank and the\nCompany were in compliance with the regulatory capital requirements and met or exceeded the amounts required to be\nconsidered “well-capitalized” as defined in the regulations.\nNot included in the Bank’s capital, WSFS separately held $307.4 million in cash to support share repurchases, potential\ndividends, acquisitions, strategic growth plans and other general corporate purposes.\n56\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity\nWe manage our liquidity and funding needs through our Treasury function and our Asset/Liability Committee. We have a\npolicy that separately addresses liquidity, and management monitors our adherence to policy limits. Also, liquidity risk\nmanagement is a primary area of examination by the banking regulators.\nFunding sources to support growth and meet our liquidity needs include cash from operations, commercial, consumer, wealth\nand trust deposits, loan repayments, FHLB borrowings, repurchase agreements, access to the Federal Reserve Discount\nWindow, and access to the brokered deposit market as well as other wholesale funding avenues. In addition, we have a large\nportfolio of high-quality, liquid investments, primarily short-duration mortgage-backed securities, that provide a near-\ncontinuous source of cash flow to meet current cash needs, or can be sold to meet larger discrete needs for cash. We believe\nthese sources are sufficient to meet our funding needs as well as maintain required and prudent levels of liquidity over the next\ntwelve months and beyond.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $1.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. As of September 30,\n2024, our estimated uninsured deposits were $6.1 billion, or 37% of total customer deposits, and our estimated unprotected\ndeposits (uninsured and uncollateralized) were $4.9 billion, or 30% of total customer deposits.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had a readily available, secured borrowing capacity of $5.6 billion from the FHLB and\n$2.0 billion through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. In addition, the Company had $1.4 billion in unpledged securities\nthat could be used to support additional borrowings and $0.3 billion of cash deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank.\nOur primary cash contractual obligations relate to operating leases, long-term debt, credit obligations, and data processing. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, we had $219.9 million in total contractual payments for ongoing leases that have remaining lease terms of\nless than one year to 21 years, which includes renewal options that are exercised at our discretion. For additional information on\nour operating leases, see Note 8 to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. At September 30, 2024, we had\nobligations for principal payments on long-term debt including $43.2 million of FHLB advances, $67.0 million for our trust\npreferred borrowings, due June 1, 2035, $70.0 million of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2027, and $150.0 million\nfor our senior debt, due December 15, 2030. At September 30, 2024, we had advances of $700.0 million under the BTFP, due\nJanuary 2025. On October 11, 2024 and October 18, 2024, WSFS Bank executed repayments of advances under the Bank Term\nFunding Program (BTFP) totaling $700.0 million of principal and $25.1 million of accrued interest. Royal Bancshares Capital\nTrust I (Trust I) and Royal Bancshares Capital Trust II (Trust II) (collectively, the RBC Trusts), which were acquired from\nBryn Mawr Bank Corporation, were utilized for the sole purpose of issuing and selling capital securities representing preferred\nbeneficial interests. Although WSFS owns an aggregate of $0.8 million of the common securities of Trust I and Trust II, the\nRBC Trusts are not consolidated into the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Inclusive of the fair value marks,\nWSFS assumed junior subordinated debentures owed to the RBC Trusts with a current carrying value of $11.9 million each,\ntotaling $23.8 million. The Company records its investments in the RBC Trusts’ common securities of $0.4 million each as\ninvestments in unconsolidated entities and records dividend income upon declaration by Trust I and Trust II. The Company has\nfully and unconditionally guaranteed all of the obligations of the RBC Trusts, including any distributions and payments on\nliquidation or redemption of the capital securities. We are also contractually obligated to make interest payments on our long-\nterm debt through their respective maturities.\nCommitments to extend credit provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the customer continues to meet specific\ncriteria. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.\nSince many of the commitments are expected to expire without being completely drawn upon, the total commitment amounts\ndo not necessarily represent future cash requirements. At September 30, 2024, the Company had total commitments to extend\ncredit of $4.1 billion, which are generally one year commitments.\n57\nTable of Contents\nNONPERFORMING ASSETS\nNonperforming assets include nonaccruing loans, OREO and restructured loans. Nonaccruing loans are those on which we no\nlonger accrue interest. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if, in the opinion of management, collection is\ndoubtful, or when principal or interest is past due 90 days or more and the value of the collateral is insufficient to cover\nprincipal and interest. Interest accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed and charged\nagainst interest income. In addition, the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended when a loan is placed on nonaccrual\nstatus. Subsequent cash receipts are applied either to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income,\ndepending on management’s assessment of the ultimate collectability of principal and interest. Past due loans are defined as\nloans contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest payments but which remain in accrual status because\nthey are considered well secured and in the process of collection.\nThe following table shows our nonperforming assets and past due loans at the dates indicated:\n(Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nNonaccruing loans(1):\nCommercial and industrial $ 64,939 $ 29,389\nOwner-occupied commercial 6,154 4,862\nCommercial mortgages 7,449 22,292\nConstruction 3,308 12,617\nResidential 5,099 2,579\nConsumer 3,090 2,446\nTotal nonaccruing loans(2) 90,039 74,185\nOther real estate owned 1,301 1,569\nTotal nonperforming assets $ 91,340 $ 75,754\nPast due loans:\nCommercial $ 23,945 $ 1,552\nResidential 15 —\nConsumer(3) 7,754 10,032\nTotal past due loans $ 31,714 $ 11,584\nTroubled loans:\nCommercial $ 158,826 $ 85,330\nResidential 309 777\nConsumer 7,619 9,161\nTotal troubled loans $ 166,754 $ 95,268\nRatio of allowance for credit losses to total loans and leases(4) 1.48 % 1.46 %\nRatio of nonaccruing loans to total gross loans and leases(5) 0.68 0.58\nRatio of nonperforming assets to total assets 0.44 0.37\nRatio of allowance for credit losses to nonaccruing loans 219 251\nRatio of allowance for credit losses to total nonperforming assets(6) 216 246\n(1) Includes nonaccruing troubled loans.\n(2) Includes nonaccrual loans held-for-sale as of December 31, 2023\n(3) Includes U.S. government guaranteed student loans with little risk of credit loss.\n(4) Represents amortized cost basis for loans and leases.\n(5) Total loans exclude loans held for sale and reverse mortgages.\n(6) Excludes acquired purchase credit deteriorated loans.\nNonperforming assets increased $15.6 million between December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. This increase was\nprimarily driven by the addition of two C&I relationships during the third quarter, partially offset by favorable resolutions and\npaydowns of multiple loans during the year and a charge-off on a commercial mortgage relationship. The ratio of\nnonperforming assets to total assets increased from 0.37% at December 31, 2023 to 0.44% at September 30, 2024.\n58\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the changes in nonperforming assets during the periods indicated:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nBeginning balance $ 75,754 $ 43,372\nAdditions 146,457 75,216\nCollections (63,672) (16,487)\nTransfers to accrual(1) (15,430) (20,263)\nCharge-offs (51,769) (24,080)\nEnding balance $ 91,340 $ 57,758\n(1) Includes impact of ASU No. 2022-02 adoption in 2023.\nThe timely identification of problem loans is a key element in our strategy to manage our loan portfolio. Problem loans are all\ncriticized, classified and nonperforming loans and other real estate owned. Timely identification enables us to take appropriate\naction and accordingly, minimize losses. An asset review system established to monitor the asset quality of our loans and\ninvestments in real estate portfolios facilitates the identification of problem assets. In general, this system uses guidelines\nestablished by federal regulation.\n59\nTable of Contents\nINTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY\nOur primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest\nincome and capital, while maximizing the yield/cost spread on our asset/liability structure. Interest rates are partly a function of\ndecisions by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on the target range for the federal funds rate, and these decisions are\nsometimes difficult to anticipate. The FOMC lowered the federal funds target rate once in 2024 for a total of 50 basis points and\nincreased the target rate four times in 2023 for a total of 100 basis points, and has suggested it may continue lowering interest\nrates further in 2024. In order to manage the risks associated with changes or possible changes in interest rates, we rely\nprimarily on our asset/liability structure.\nOur primary tool for achieving our asset/liability management strategies is to match maturities or repricing periods of interest\nrate-sensitive assets and liabilities to promote a favorable interest rate spread and mitigate exposure to fluctuations in interest\nrates. We regularly review our interest rate sensitivity and adjust the sensitivity within acceptable tolerance ranges. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, interest-bearing liabilities exceeded interest-earning assets that mature or reprice within one year (interest-\nsensitive gap) by $162.4 million. Our interest-sensitive assets as a percentage of interest-sensitive liabilities within the one-year\nwindow was 98.25% at September 30, 2024 compared with 99.67% at December 31, 2023. Likewise, the one-year interest-\nsensitive gap as a percentage of total assets was (0.78)% at September 30, 2024 compared with (0.14)% at December 31, 2023.\nMarket risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. Our market risk arises primarily from interest\nrate risk inherent in our lending, investing, and funding activities. To that end, we actively monitor and manage our interest rate\nrisk exposure. One measure evaluates the impact of an immediate change in interest rates in 100 basis point increments on the\neconomic value of equity ratio. The economic value of the equity ratio is defined as the economic value of the estimated cash\nflows from assets and liabilities as a percentage of economic value of cash flows from total assets.\nThe following table shows the estimated impact of immediate changes in interest rates on our net interest margin and economic\nvalue of equity ratio at the specified levels at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n% Change in Interest Rate % Change in Net Economic Value of % Change in Net Economic Value of\n(Basis Points) Interest Margin(1) Equity(2) Interest Margin(1) Equity(2)\n+300 13.8% 15.25% 15.7% 22.44%\n+200 9.1% 15.73% 10.4% 21.46%\n+100 4.4% 16.17% 5.2% 20.41%\n+50 2.1% 16.42% 2.6% 19.85%\n+25 0.9% 16.48% 1.3% 19.56%\n— —% 16.54% —% 19.26%\n-25 (1.0)% 16.60% (1.3)% 18.96%\n-50 (1.9)% 16.65% (2.6)% 18.64%\n-100 (3.4)% 16.50% (4.9)% 18.00%\n'-200 (5.7)% 15.90% (9.6)% 16.50%\n'-300 (8.1)% 14.40% (14.2)% 14.80%\n(1) The percentage difference between net interest margin in a stable interest rate environment and net interest margin as projected under the\nvarious rate change environments.\n(2) The economic value of equity ratio in a stable interest rate environment and the economic value of equity ratio as projected under the\nvarious rate change environments.\nWe also engage in other business activities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For example, mortgage banking\nrevenues and expenses can fluctuate with changing interest rates. These fluctuations are difficult to model and estimate.\n60\nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThree months ended September 30, 2024: Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $64.4 million,\ncompared to $74.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n• Net interest income decreased $5.1 million, primarily due to continued deposit mix shift and growth in higher priced\ndeposit products over the past year. See “Net Interest Income” for further information.\n• Our provision for credit losses was flat. See “Allowance for Credit Losses” for further information.\n• Noninterest income increased $17.5 million, driven by the Cash Connect®, Wealth Management, Core Banking, and\nMortgage business lines. Growth in Cash Connect® was driven by bailment Customers added in the fourth quarter of\n2023 and first half of 2024. Growth in Wealth Management was driven by growth across all key product lines. We also\nrecognized revenue from our partnership with Spring EQ. See “Noninterest Income” for further information.\n• Noninterest expense increased $24.0 million, primarily due to higher salaries and benefits from annual performance-\nbased increases and talent additions in key business lines and Cash Connect® funding costs associated with a shift\ntowards external funding.\n• Income tax provision decreased $1.8 million, primarily due to the $11.7 million decrease in pre-tax income, partially\noffset by higher state income taxes.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024: Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $199.5 million,\ncompared to $205.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n• Net interest income decreased $19.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the reasons described above. See “Net Interest Income” for further\ninformation.\n• Our provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $9.9 million compared to the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023, due to lower losses within our commercial and industrial loan portfolio and\nour residential and consumer loan portfolios, partially offset by higher losses on our commercial mortgages and\ncommercial small business leases portfolios. See “Allowance for Credit Losses” for further information.\n• Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased $54.9 million compared to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases from Cash Connect®, Wealth Management fee income,\nrevenue from our partnership with Spring EQ, a gain on our Visa B derivative liability, mortgage banking activities,\nand capital markets income. See “Noninterest Income” for further information.\n• Noninterest expense increased $54.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases in Cash Connect® funding costs associated with a shift\ntowards external funding and salaries and benefits from annual performance-based increases and talent additions in\nkey business lines. The increase was partially offset by decreases in net corporate development and restructuring costs.\n• Income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $3.3 million compared to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the benefit from our low-income housing tax credit investments,\nsolar tax credit investments and research and development tax credits.\n61\nTable of Contents\nNet Interest Income\nThe following tables provide information concerning the balances, yields and rates on interest-earning assets and interest-\nbearing liabilities

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income decreased\n$5.1 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to continued deposit mix shift and growth in\nhigher priced deposit products. Net interest margin was 3.78% for the third quarter of 2024, a 30 basis point decrease compared\nto 4.08% for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to an unfavorable decrease of 45 basis points from\ndeposit mix shift and growth in higher priced deposit products, partially offset by an increase of 17 basis points from our loan\nyields.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024: During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income decreased\n$19.7 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the reasons noted above. Net interest margin was 3.82%\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 33 basis point decrease compared to 4.15% for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The decrease was due to a 64 basis point decrease from the mix shift and growth in higher yielding\nproducts mentioned above, partially offset by a 35 basis point increase from our loan yields.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe maintain the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level based on our assessment of estimable and expected losses in\nthe loan portfolio. Our allowance for credit losses is based on our historical loss experience that includes the inherent risk of our\nloans and various other factors including but not limited to, collateral values, trends in asset quality, level of delinquent loans\nand concentrations. Further, regional and national economic forecasts are considered in our expected credit losses. Our\nevaluation is based on a review of the portfolio and requires significant, complex and difficult judgments.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $18.4 million, which was flat\ncompared to the provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $53.4 million, a decrease of\n$9.9 million, compared to the provision for credit losses of $63.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This\ndecrease was primarily due to lower losses within our commercial and industrial loan portfolio and our residential and\nconsumer loan portfolios, partially offset by higher losses on our commercial mortgages and commercial small business leases\nportfolios.\nThe allowance for credit losses increased to $197.5 million at September 30, 2024 from $186.1 million at December 31, 2023.\nThe ratio of allowance for credit losses to total loans and leases was 1.48% at September 30, 2024 and 1.46% at December 31,\n2023.\n64\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables detail the allocation of the ACL and show our net charge-offs (recoveries) by portfolio category:\nCommercial\nCommercial Owner- Small\nand occupied Commercial Business\n(Dollars in thousands) Industrial Commercial Mortgages Construction Leases Residential(1) Consumer(2) Total\nAs of September 30, 2024\nAllowance for credit\nlosses $ 56,795 $ 9,787 $ 48,989 $ 8,348 $ 15,374 $ 5,463 $ 52,734 $ 197,490\n% of ACL to total ACL 28 % 5 % 25 % 4 % 8 % 3 % 27 % 100 %\nLoan portfolio balance $ 2,639,266 $ 2,003,722 $ 4,149,049 $ 805,857 $ 645,421 $ 937,594 $ 2,138,079 $ 13,318,988\n% to total loans and\nleases 20 % 15 % 31 % 6 % 5 % 7 % 16 % 100 %\nThree months ended September 30, 2024\nCharge-offs $ 11,277 $ 177 $ 205 $ — $ 5,451 $ 8 $ 5,983 $ 23,101\nRecoveries (2,481) (4) (79) — (664) (44) (644) (3,916)\nNet charge-offs\n(recoveries) $ 8,796 $ 173 $ 126 $ — $ 4,787 $ (36) $ 5,339 $ 19,185\nAverage loan balance $ 2,639,118 $ 1,965,881 $ 4,088,430 $ 864,142 $ 641,723 $ 921,843 $ 2,112,423 $ 13,233,560\nRatio of net charge-offs\n(recoveries) to average\ngross loans 1.33 % 0.04 % 0.01 % — % 2.97 % (0.02) % 1.01 % 0.58 %\nNine months ended September 30, 2024\nCharge-offs $ 13,659 $ 177 $ 5,137 $ — $ 15,191 $ 109 $ 18,259 $ 52,532\nRecoveries (5,983) (209) (183) — (2,086) (176) (1,884) (10,521)\nNet charge-offs\n(recoveries) $ 7,676 $ (32) $ 4,954 $ — $ 13,105 $ (67) $ 16,375 $ 42,011\nAverage loan balance $ 2,584,491 $ 1,917,033 $ 3,945,673 $ 990,687 $ 635,286 $ 894,489 $ 2,080,780 $ 13,048,439\nRatio of net charge-offs\n(recoveries) to average\ngross loans 0.40 % NMF 0.17 % — % 2.76 % (0.01) % 1.05 % 0.43 %\n(1) Excludes reverse mortgages.\n(2) Includes home equity lines of credit, installment loans unsecured lines of credit and education loans.\nCommercial\nCommercial Owner- Small\nand occupied Commercial Business\n(Dollars in thousands) Industrial Commercial Mortgages Construction Leases Residential(1) Consumer(2) Total\nAs of December 31, 2023\nAllowance for credit\nlosses $ 49,394 $ 10,719 $ 36,055 $ 10,762 $ 15,170 $ 5,483 $ 58,543 $ 186,126\n% of ACL to total ACL 27 % 6 % 19 % 6 % 8 % 3 % 31 % 100 %\nLoan portfolio balance $ 2,540,070 $ 1,886,087 $ 3,801,180 $ 1,035,530 $ 623,622 $ 867,895 $ 2,012,134 $ 12,766,518\n% to total loans and\nleases 19 % 15 % 30 % 8 % 5 % 7 % 16 % 100 %\nYear ended December 31, 2023\nCharge-offs $ 26,653 $ 184 $ 300 $ 794 $ 15,641 $ 41 $ 22,394 $ 66,007\nRecoveries (7,735) (54) (7) (532) (1,986) (260) (1,625) (12,199)\nNet charge-offs\n(recoveries) $ 18,918 $ 130 $ 293 $ 262 $ 13,655 $ (219) $ 20,769 $ 53,808\nAverage loan balance $ 2,589,147 $ 1,863,542 $ 3,562,070 $ 1,008,768 $ 588,592 $ 817,758 $ 1,922,828 $ 12,352,704\nRatio of net charge-offs\n(recoveries) to average\ngross loans 0.73 % 0.01 % 0.01 % 0.03 % 2.32 % (0.03) % 1.08 % 0.44 %\n(1) Excludes reverse mortgages.\n(2) Includes home equity lines of credit, installment loans unsecured lines of credit and education loans.\nSee Note 7 to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and \"Nonperforming Assets\" above for further information.\n65\nTable of Contents\nNoninterest Income\nThree months ended September 30, 2024: During the three months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest income was $90.2\nmillion, an increase of $17.5 million from $72.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The growth was\ndriven by the Cash Connect®, Wealth Management, Core Banking, and Mortgage business lines. Growth in Cash Connect® of\n$10.6 million was driven by the addition of bailment Customers during the fourth quarter of 2023 and first half of 2024. Growth\nin Wealth Management of $3.4 million was driven by growth across all key product lines. We also recognized $2.3 million in\nrevenue from our partnership with Spring EQ related to the annual earnout form the previously announced sale.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024: During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest income was $257.6\nmillion, an increase of $54.9 million from $202.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was\nprimarily driven by $29.8 million from Cash Connect® due to the reason mentioned above, $11.1 million in Wealth\nManagement fees, $4.3 million from our partnership with Spring EQ, comprised of the $2.3 million annual earnout mentioned\nabove and post-close distributions of $2.0 million, a $2.7 million net gain on our Visa B derivative liability established from our\nprevious sale of 360,000 shares in 2Q 2020, $2.3 million from mortgage banking activities, and $2.0 million in capital markets\nincome.\nFor further information, see Note 3 to the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNoninterest Expense\nThree months ended September 30, 2024: During the three months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense was $163.7\nmillion, an increase of $24.0 million from $139.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was\nprimarily due to $11.7 million from salaries and benefits from annual and performance-based increases and talent additions in\nkey business lines and $9.3 million from other operating expense driven by higher funding costs from Cash Connect® due to a\nshift towards external funding (which was offset in noninterest income).\nNine months ended September 30, 2024: During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense was $468.6\nmillion, an increase of $54.6 million from $414.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was\nprimarily due to $30.1 million in other operating expense driven by higher funding costs from Cash Connect® due to a shift\ntowards external funding and $25.5 million in salaries and benefits, partially offset by a $2.5 million decrease in net corporate\ndevelopment and restructuring costs.\nIncome Taxes\nWe and our subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and separate state income tax returns. Income taxes are\naccounted for in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires the recording of deferred income taxes for tax\nconsequences of temporary differences. We recorded income tax expense of $21.1 million and $63.6 million during the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to income tax expense of $22.9 million and $66.9 million\nfor the same periods in 2023, respectively.\nOur effective tax rate was 24.7% and 24.2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared\nto 23.6% and 24.6% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 increased primarily due to an increase in state income taxes. The effective tax rate for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased primarily due to projected tax benefits from our low-income housing tax\ncredit investments, solar tax credit investments and research and development tax credits.\nThe effective tax rate reflects the recognition of certain tax benefits in the financial statements including those benefits from\ntax-exempt interest income, federal low-income housing tax credits, solar tax credits, research and development tax credits, and\nexcess tax benefits from recognized stock compensation. These tax benefits are offset by the tax effect of stock-based\ncompensation expense related to incentive stock options, tax deficiencies from recognized stock compensation, and a provision\nfor state income tax expense. We frequently analyze our projections of taxable income and make adjustments to our provision\nfor income taxes accordingly.\n66\nTable of Contents\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURE TO GAAP MEASURE\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of tangible book value per share of common stock to book value per share of\ncommon stock, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We believe this measure helps management and\ninvestors better understand and assess changes from period to period in stockholders’ equity exclusive of changes in intangible\nassets. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and is not a\nsubstitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.\n(Dollars and share amounts in thousands, except per share amounts) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nStockholders’ equity of WSFS $ 2,678,264 $ 2,477,636\nLess: Goodwill and other intangible assets 992,163 1,004,560\nTangible common equity (numerator) $ 1,686,101 $ 1,473,076\nShares of common stock outstanding (denominator) 59,033 60,538\nBook value per share of common stock $ 45.37 $ 40.93\nGoodwill and other intangible assets 16.81 16.58\nTangible book value per share of common stock $ 28.56 $ 24.33\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make\nestimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We regularly evaluate\nthese estimates and assumptions including those related to the allowance for credit losses, business combinations, deferred\ntaxes, fair value measurements and goodwill and other intangible assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and\nvarious other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These form the basis for\nmaking judgments on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual\nresults may differ from these estimates. Although our current estimates contemplate current economic conditions and how we\nexpect them to change in the future, for the remainder of 2024, it is possible that actual conditions may be worse than\nanticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. Actual results\nmay differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nCritical accounting estimates at September 30, 2024 did not significantly change from our critical accounting estimates at\nDecember 31, 2023, which are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nRECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS\nRecent regulatory developments at September 30, 2024 did not significantly change from our recent regulatory developments at\nDecember 31, 2023, which are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except as\nnoted below.\nBank Merger Review Standards\nIn September 2024, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) finalized a new Policy Statement Regarding\nStatutory Factors Under the Bank Merger Act (the “Policy Statement”), which outlines factors that the OCC will considering\nwhen evaluating a proposed bank merger transaction, including factors related to financial stability, the financial and\nmanagerial resources and future prospects of the existing and proposed institutions, and the convenience and needs of the\ncommunity. The Policy Statement also lists thirteen indicators that will be present in merger applications that are more likely to\nbe approved expeditiously, including that the resulting institution will have total assets less than $50 billion and that the target’s\ntotal assets are less than 50 percent of the acquirer’s total assets. It remains uncertain how the OCC will apply the Policy\nStatement to particular transactions, and the Policy Statement may make it more difficult and/or costly for us to obtain\nregulatory approval for an acquisition or otherwise result in more onerous conditions in approval orders than the OCC has\npreviously imposed.\nAlso in September 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) withdrew from its 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines and\nannounced that it will instead evaluate the competitive impact of bank mergers using its 2023 Merger Guidelines that apply\nacross all industries. Compared to the 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines, the 2023 Merger Guidelines set forth more stringent\nconcentration limits and add several largely qualitative bases on which the DOJ may challenge a merger. This change in the\nDOJ’s bank merger antitrust policy creates uncertainty regarding the types of transactions that the DOJ may challenge as\nanticompetitive.\n67\nTable of Contents\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe information required by this Item is incorporated herein by reference to the information provided in Part I Item 2 (Interest\nRate Sensitivity) of this Quarterly Report on Form-10-Q.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Based on their evaluation of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), our principal executive\nofficer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to\nbe disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange\nCommission’s rules and forms.\n(b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting.

The grants, approved in the third quarter by the WSFS CARES Foundation board, will support the following organizations: \n\n  * **Pathways to Success ($160,000 Grant to be paid over two years)** Pathways to Success, based in Georgetown, Del., was established in 2006 to prepare youth, adults, and their families for successful lives. Their programs use innovative and creative approaches to mentor and educate individuals to become healthy, productive, contributing, and responsible citizens through in-school and after-school programs, Powering the Workforce, Work Experience Program (WEX), fair housing, Grow Your Own Teacher, and Microsoft Office training. The WSFS funds will assist with the hiring of a Licensed Clinical Social Worker to manage the Pathways to Wellbeing Program to support students that are affected with Post Traumatic Stress (PTSD). \n  * **Trust for Public Land ($75,000 Grant to be paid over three years)** Trust for Public Land is a national nonprofit that creates parks and protects land ensuring people have healthy livable communities for generations to come. The Trust for Public Land is committed to creating more places that bring people outside, such as parks, trails, playgrounds, and schoolyards, making them accessible and welcoming to everyone. The WSFS funds will support the next phase of the Philadelphia Community Schoolyards Program as well as help design and develop three new community schoolyard projects in neighborhoods in Philadelphia. \n\n\n\n“Through our ongoing support of local nonprofit partners, we strive to create lasting change and enhance the lives of those around us,” said Patrick J.

As we look to the future, we are confident that these partnerships will lead to even more transformative outcomes for the communities we proudly serve.\" \n\n“The generosity of this grant is a testament to the power of collaboration in addressing mental health concerns. We look forward to working with our partners to create lasting change and foster a thriving community,” said Fay Blake, Founder and Executive Director, Pathways to Success. “With this grant, we can provide essential support and resources to students and families struggling with trauma. Our commitment to serving our students’ and communities’ well-being has never been more vital to making a positive difference in their lives.” \n\n“Trust for Public Land is grateful for WSFS’ support of our Philadelphia Community Schoolyards Program. With their partnership in the years ahead, we look forward to transforming more of Philadelphia’s schoolyards from asphalt lots that bake in the summer and flood during rainstorms into high-quality outdoor spaces that improve student education outcomes, community health, and climate resiliency,” said Owen Franklin, Vice President, Great Lakes Region and Pennsylvania State Director, Trust for Public Land. “Thank you to our partners at WSFS for sharing in TPL’s commitment to connect people to the benefits and joys of the outdoors.” \n\n**About the WSFS CARES Foundation**\n\nThe WSFS CARES Foundation brings WSFS’ mission of We Stand for Service® to life across the communities we serve.

For a reconciliation of this and other non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures, see \"Non-GAAP Reconciliation\" at the end of the press release.   \n---  \n  \n**CEO Commentary**\n\nRodger Levenson, Chairman, CEO and President, said, \"WSFS performed very well in the third quarter as reflected in our operating results of a core ROA (2) of 1.22% and accompanying core EPS (2) of $1.08. \n\n“Despite muted demand, our results were highlighted by annualized loan growth of 5% driven by our commercial, consumer, and residential mortgage portfolios. In addition, deposits grew 3% on an annualized basis primarily due to seasonal municipal deposit inflows. \n\n“Our diverse fee businesses also continued to perform solidly. During the quarter, we completed the conversions of our trust accounting system and client portal in our Wealth Management business. These conversions were executed as part of our Bryn Mawr Trust integration plan and position us for significant future growth. \n\n“Total net credit costs increased modestly compared to the prior quarter with a decrease in the provision for credit losses offset by an increase in reserves for unfunded loan commitments. The negative migration in credit metrics includes two existing problem commercial loans (office-related and hotel) which moved to nonperforming assets in the quarter. \n\n“While the 50 basis point decrease in the Fed Funds Rate in mid-September had a minimal impact on 3Q results, we have updated our full year 2024 Outlook in our Earnings Release Supplement to reflect this change. \n\n“We look forward to finishing 2024 strong and as always I want to extend my sincere thanks to our 2,300 Associates who work tirelessly to serve our Customers, Communities and each other every day.” \n\n(2)  As used in this press release, core ROA and core EPS are non-GAAP financial measures.

Total commercial loans and leases increased $104.6 million, with growth from new originations and the conversion of construction loans, which drove increases in the C&I and commercial mortgage portfolios. \n\nConsumer loans increased $31.6 million, primarily from Spring EQ home equity loans, partially offset by a decrease in Upstart loans. We met the 2024 origination target with Spring EQ and do not expect additional originations in the fourth quarter. As a result of the previously announced sale of Spring EQ, we are evaluating volumes for 2025. Residential mortgages increased $29.2 million due to the retention of certain loans based on favorable yields and relationship opportunities. \n\nGross loans and leases at September 30, 2024 increased $649.2 million, or 5%, when compared with September 30, 2023. The growth was driven by increases of $503.3 million in commercial mortgage, $181.0 million in consumer loans (primarily from Spring EQ), $91.9 million in residential mortgage due to the reasons noted above, and $71.0 million in C&I. These increases were partially offset by a $237.7 million decrease in construction loans, as they migrated into commercial mortgages and C&I loans, including owner-occupied real estate. \n\nThe following table summarizes customer deposit balances and composition at September 30, 2024 compared to June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023: \n\n**Customer Deposits**  \n---  \n**_(_ ** _Dollars in millions)_ |  **September 30, 2024** |  June 30, 2024  |  September 30, 2023   \nNoninterest demand  |  **$** |  **4,686** |  **29** |  **%** |  $  |  4,783  |  29  |  %  |  $  |  4,913  |  31  |  %   \nInterest-bearing demand  |  **2,931** |  **18** |  2,812  |  17  |  3,028  |  19   \nSavings  |  **1,489** |  **9** |  1,537  |  9  |  1,681  |  10   \nMoney market  |  **5,178** |  **31** |  5,175  |  33  |  4,560  |  29   \nTotal core deposits  |  **14,284** |  **87** |  14,307  |  88  |  14,182  |  89   \nCustomer time deposits  |  **2,143** |  **13** |  1,984  |  12  |  1,715  |  11   \nTotal customer deposits  |  **$** |  **16,427** |  **100** |  **%** |  $  |  16,291  |  100  |  %  |  $  |  15,897  |  100  |  %   \n  \nTotal customer deposits increased by $136.0 million, 1% (3% annualized), when compared with June 30, 2024, primarily driven by seasonal increases in municipal deposits of $227.7 million and continued increases in customer time deposits, partially offset by expected outflows in Wealth and Trust deposits. Average customer deposits increased 1% (5% annualized), including 12% (annualized) in noninterest demand, compared to June 30, 2024, primarily from Wealth and Trust flows. \n\nTotal customer deposits increased by $529.8 million, or 3%, from September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases in money market and time deposits. The growth was concentrated in the Commercial and Consumer businesses. \n\nThe deposit base remains well-diversified, with 51% of customer deposits coming from the Commercial, Small Business, and Wealth and Trust business lines. The loan-to-deposit ratio (4) was 80% at September 30, 2024, providing continued capacity to fund future loan growth. \n\nCore deposits were 87% of total customer deposits, with a weighted average cost of 159bps for the quarter. Small mix changes continued this quarter with no- and low-cost checking accounts representing 47% of total customer deposits with a weighted average cost of 46bps for the quarter. \n\n(4) Ratio of net loans and leases to total customer deposits.   \n---  \n  \n**Net Interest Income**\n\nThree Months Ending   \n---  \n**_(_ ** _Dollars in millions)_ |  **September 30, 2024** |  June 30, 2024  |  September 30, 2023   \nNet interest income before purchase accretion  |  **$** |  **175.5** |  $  |  172.7  |  $  |  178.8   \nPurchase accounting accretion  |  **2.0** |  1.7  |  3.8   \nNet interest income  |  **$** |  **177.5** |  $  |  174.4  |  $  |  182.6   \nNet interest margin before purchase accretion  |  **3.74** |  **%** |  3.81  |  %  |  4.00  |  %   \nPurchase accounting accretion  |  **0.04** |  0.04  |  0.08   \nNet interest margin  |  **3.78** |  **%** |  3.85  |  %  |  4.08  |  %   \n  \nNet interest income increased $3.1 million, or 2% (not annualized), compared to 2Q 2024, primarily due to loan growth. Net interest income decreased $5.1 million, or 3%, compared to 3Q 2023, primarily driven by continued deposit mix shift and growth in higher yielding deposit products. \n\nTotal loan yields were 7.07%, a decrease of 2bps when compared to 2Q 2024. Total customer deposit costs were 1.95%, an increase of 6bps, while interest-bearing customer deposit costs were 2.79%, an increase of 10bps compared to the prior quarter. The deposit cost increase was driven by growth in higher-priced deposits as we saw opportunities to deepen existing relationships and attract new business. \n\nNet interest margin decreased 7bps from 2Q 2024, mainly due to growth in municipal and higher priced deposits as described above (3bps), as well as slightly lower asset yields, which were partially driven by market-value increases on available-for-sale investment securities (2bps). Net interest margin decreased 30bps from 3Q 2023, primarily driven by continued deposit mix shift and growth in higher priced deposit products over the past year. \n\nTo mitigate asset sensitivity, WSFS completed a previously announced $1.5 billion hedging program utilizing floor options. \n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nThe following table summarizes asset quality metrics as of and for the period ended September 30, 2024 compared to June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. \n\n_(Dollars in millions)_ |  **September 30, 2024** |  June 30, 2024  |  September 30, 2023   \n---|---|---|---  \nProblem assets (5) |  **$** |  **721.5** |  $  |  628.5  |  $  |  543.4   \nDelinquencies  |  **147.6** |  89.0  |  110.8   \nNonperforming assets  |  **91.3** |  65.4  |  57.8   \nNet charge-offs  |  **19.2** |  14.2  |  14.3   \nTotal net credit costs (r)  |  **20.1** |  18.5  |  18.2   \nProblem assets to total Tier 1 capital plus ACL  |  **30.11** |  **%** |  27.00  |  %  |  23.61  |  %   \nClassified assets to total Tier 1 capital plus ACL  |  **21.41** |  19.93  |  16.11   \nRatio of nonperforming assets to total assets  |  **0.44** |  0.32  |  0.29   \nDelinquencies to gross loans (n)  |  **1.11** |  0.68  |  0.87   \nRatio of quarterly net charge-offs to average gross loans  |  **0.58** |  0.44  |  0.45   \nRatio of allowance for credit losses to total loans and leases (q)  |  **1.48** |  1.51  |  1.39   \nRatio of allowance for credit losses to nonaccruing loans  |  **219** |  310  |  306   \nSee “Notes”   \n  \nTotal net credit costs were $20.1 million in the quarter, an increase of $1.6 million, compared to $18.5 million in 2Q 2024. Total net credit costs include a provision for credit losses of $18.4 million, which declined slightly from 2Q 2024. The increase in total net credit costs was due to higher reserves for unfunded commitments related to new loan commitments and the continued evaluation of the portfolio, as well as higher loan workout costs. \n\nNonperforming assets increased $25.9 million, or 12bps of total assets, compared to June 30, 2024, primarily driven by the migration of two loans - a $19.2 million C&I loan, in participation with another bank, to a fund that is invested in office properties predominantly in east coast suburban markets and a $14.7 million hotel loan in suburban Philadelphia, partially offset by the resolution of previously identified nonperforming assets. \n\nNet charge-offs increased $5.0 million to $19.2 million, or 0.58% (annualized) of average gross loans during the quarter, mainly due to the previously identified hotel loan. Excluding Upstart and NewLane, which experienced losses consistent with the prior quarter, net charge-offs were 31bps of average gross loans. \n\nProblem assets to total Tier 1 capital plus ACL ratio was 30.11%, an increase of 311bps compared to June 30, 2024, based on the continued evaluation of the portfolio. \n\n(5) Problem assets includes all criticized, classified, and nonperforming loans as well as other real estate owned (OREO).   \n---  \n  \nDelinquencies of $147.6 million, or 111bps of gross loans, increased $58.6 million, or 43bps, compared to June 30, 2024. This increase was primarily driven by the previously mentioned hotel loan and one additional $42.1 million commercial real estate relationship in which we are working with the sponsor on a path toward resolution. \n\nThe ACL was $197.5 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of $0.8 million from June 30, 2024. The ACL coverage ratio was 1.48%, a decrease of 3bps from June 30, 2024. The decreases in the ACL and coverage ratio were due to continued runoff on the Upstart portfolio. \n\n**Core Fee Revenue**\n\nFee businesses, including Wealth and Trust, Cash Connect ® , Capital Markets, and Mortgage Banking reflect the investments we have made to diversify our revenue. Core fee revenue (noninterest income) of $90.1 million increased $4.1 million, or 5% (not annualized), compared to $86.0 million from 2Q 2024, primarily driven by $2.3 million of revenue from our partnership with Spring EQ (related to the annual earnout from the previously announced sale), $0.8 million from Cash Connect ® due to increases in bailment and smart safe revenue, and $0.7 million from Bank Owned Life Insurance. \n\nCore fee revenue increased $16.7 million, or 23%, compared to 3Q 2023. The growth was driven by the Cash Connect ® , Wealth Management, Core Banking, and Mortgage business lines. Growth in Cash Connect ®  was driven by bailment Customers added in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first half of 2024. Growth in Wealth Management was driven by growth across all key product lines, with double digit growth in Institutional Services and The Bryn Mawr Trust Company of Delaware (BMT of DE). \n\nFor 3Q 2024, our core fee revenue ratio (6) was 33.6% compared to 33.0% in 2Q 2024 and 28.6% in 3Q 2023. Fee revenue is a competitive differentiator providing a well-diversified source of revenue with further growth opportunities expected. \n\n(6) As used in this press release, core fee revenue ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes certain pre-tax adjustments and the tax impact of such adjustments. For a reconciliation of this and other non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures, see \"Non-GAAP Reconciliation\" at the end of the press release.   \n---  \n  \n**Core Noninterest Expense(7) **\n\nCore noninterest expense of $163.7 million increased $7.7 million, or 5% (not annualized), compared to 2Q 2024. The increase included $3.0 million related to changes in unfunded loan commitment reserves due to new loan commitments and the continued evaluation of the portfolio, as well as higher loan workout costs. In addition, salaries and benefits increased by $2.9 million due to increased performance-based incentive accruals and talent additions as we continue to invest in the franchise, as well as a $1.4 million increase in external fraud losses. \n\nCore noninterest expense increased $24.1 million, or 17%, compared to 3Q 2023. The increase was primarily due to $11.7 million in higher salaries and benefits from annual and performance-based increases and talent additions in key business lines, as well as $8.5 million from Cash Connect ®  external funding costs. Excluding the Cash Connect ® external funding costs (which were offset in revenue), expenses increased by 12% compared to 3Q 2023. \n\nOur core efficiency ratio (7) was 61.1% in 3Q 2024, compared to 59.8% in 2Q 2024 and 54.4% in 3Q 2023. \n\n**Income Taxes**\n\nWe recorded a $21.1 million income tax provision in 3Q 2024, compared to $21.3 million in 2Q 2024 and $22.9 million in 3Q 2023. \n\nThe effective tax rate was 24.7% in 3Q 2024 compared to 23.5% in 2Q 2024 and 23.6% in 3Q 2023. The increase in effective tax rate for 3Q 2024 compared to 2Q 2024 was primarily driven by higher state taxes along with higher solar tax credit investment benefits in the second quarter. The increase in effective tax rate when compared to 3Q 2023 is attributable to an increase in state taxes. On a year-to-date basis, the effective tax rate was 24.2% in 2024 compared to 24.6% for the same period in 2023. \n\n(7) As used in this press release, core noninterest expense and core efficiency ratio are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain pre-tax adjustments and the tax impact of such adjustments. For a reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures, see \"Non-GAAP Reconciliation\" at the end of the press release.   \n---  \n  \n**Capital Management**\n\nCapital levels remain strong and are all substantially in excess of the “well-capitalized” regulatory benchmarks at September 30, 2024, with WSFS Bank’s Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.68%, Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio and Tier 1 capital ratio of 13.46%, and Total Risk-based capital ratio of 14.71%. \n\nWSFS’ total stockholders’ equity increased $188.7 million, or 8% (not annualized), during 3Q 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) of $142.9 million driven by market-value increases on available-for-sale investment securities, as well as quarterly earnings of $64.4 million. These increases were partially offset by capital returns of $22.7 million to stockholders, comprising $13.8 million from share repurchases and $8.9 million from quarterly dividends. \n\nWSFS’ tangible common equity (8) increased $192.7 million, or 13% (not annualized), compared to June 30, 2024, primarily due to the reasons described above and scheduled amortization of intangibles. WSFS’ common equity to assets ratio increased 81bps to 12.81% during the quarter, and our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio (8)  was 8.47% at September 30, 2024, an increase of 91bps, compared to the prior quarter. \n\nAt September 30, 2024, book value per share was $45.37, an increase of $3.36, or 8% (not annualized), from June 30, 2024, and tangible book value per share was $28.56, an increase of $3.36, or 13% (not annualized), from June 30, 2024. These increases were due to the reasons described above. \n\nDuring 3Q 2024, WSFS repurchased 266,672 shares of common stock for an aggregate of $13.8 million. As of September 30, 2024, WSFS has 3,685,092 shares, or approximately 6% of outstanding shares, remaining to repurchase under its current authorization. For the year, total capital returned to stockholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividends was $101.5 million. \n\nThe Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock. This dividend will be paid on November 22, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 8, 2024. \n\n(8)  As used in this press release, tangible common equity and tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio are non-GAAP financial measures.

Net interest income increased $3.2 million, as average trust deposits were higher by $271.9 million compared to 2Q 2024. Fee revenue decreased $1.0 million from 2Q 2024, primarily due to lower seasonal tax-based revenue and nonrecurring items, partially offset by growth in Institutional Services fees. Total noninterest expense increased $0.3 million, compared to 2Q 2024, mostly due to salaries from hiring new advisors and performance-based compensation. \n\nWealth Management pre-tax income increased $0.5 million compared to 3Q 2023 due to higher fee revenue and net interest income. Net interest income increased $0.5 million due mostly to higher deposit balances. Fee revenue increased $4.0 million, or 12%, compared to 3Q 2023, due to increases in assignment and bankruptcy fees in Institutional Services, increased activity in The Bryn Mawr Trust Company of Delaware, and higher AUM in Private Wealth Management. Total noninterest expense increased $3.8 million driven by salary expenses from hiring new advisors and performance-based compensation. \n\nNet AUM of $9.3 billion at the end of 3Q 2024 increased $0.3 billion, or 3% compared to 2Q 2024, and increased $1.2 billion, or 15%, compared to 3Q 2023.

WSFS banking offices in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania will serve as deposit centers for nonperishable donations from WSFS Associates, Customers and Community members through December 31, 2024. \n\nWSFS officially kicked off the Food Drive at WSFS Bank Center in Wilmington, Del., with the Sunday Breakfast Mission, and at WSFS Bank Place in Philadelphia with Sharing Excess, encouraging Associates to bring nonperishable donations to help jumpstart the Food Drive. Grocery bags will also be distributed in a variety of Delaware publications this Fall for consumers to fill with donations to drop at their nearest WSFS banking office. \n\nAccording to Feeding America’s Map the Meal Gap 2024 report, 13.5% or more than 44 million individuals lived in a food-insecure household in 2022, a sharp increase from 10.4% in 2021. The report also found that nearly 50% of people facing hunger are unlikely to qualify for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the United States’ largest food assistance program. \n\n“Many households are struggling to put food on the table due to the surging cost of living and essentials,” said Vernita L. Dorsey, Senior Vice President, Director of Community Strategy at WSFS Bank. “We hope to make a difference by partnering with Sharing Excess and the Sunday Breakfast Mission. Every donation, no matter how small, can make a big difference. We ask those who have the means to donate nonperishable items at our banking offices to support these vital needs.” \n\n“We are excited to once again partner with WSFS for their annual holiday Food Drive,” said Evan Ehlers, Founder and CEO of Sharing Excess. “The holiday season is a time for community, and WSFS Customers have a unique opportunity to make a direct impact in the fight against food insecurity by donating at their local banking office. We deeply value WSFS’ ongoing dedication to supporting their communities and creating meaningful, lasting change through their partnership with Sharing Excess.” \n\n“For the 22 nd year, WSFS Bank and Sunday Breakfast Mission are partnering on our Food Drive that has collected food for over 1.3M meals for families in need over the years,” said Rev. Tom Laymon, Senior Pastor/CEO/President at Sunday Breakfast Mission. “But right now, Sunday Breakfast Mission is seeing more people than ever coming to them for help. We need the food donations to flood in so that hungry families can have a great Thanksgiving season. We are so grateful to WSFS Bank sponsoring once again.” \n\nIn addition to the annual Food Drive, WSFS will sponsor Preston & Steve’s Camp Out for Hunger for the seventh consecutive year to support Philabundance in their mission to drive hunger from our Communities. Camp Out for Hunger will take place from December 2-6 at Xfinity Live! in Philadelphia. \n\nIn 2023, WSFS donated more than 82,000 pounds of food through its annual Food Drive and Camp Out for Hunger. Customers and area residents are encouraged to take their nonperishable food donations to WSFS banking offices now through December 31, 2024.
