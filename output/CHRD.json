This strong performance supported the continued execution of Chord's shareholder return strategy, which included a meaningful increase to share repurchases in the third quarter. Chord's valuation is compelling, and we expect share repurchases to comprise a significant portion of future shareholder returns, especially at current prices. In addition, three-mile lateral development continues to be a key factor driving a positive rate of change through our business, and we are seeing recoveries proportional to the increased lateral length. As a result, we are updating the productivity factor of the third mile to 100%. Congratulations to the Chord team for continuing to challenge themselves to raise the bar. Your hard work is evident in our company's success.\"\n\nMr. Brown continued, \"Since closing, the Chord team has been working diligently to integrate the Enerplus assets, drive synergy capture and enhance efficiency. I'm pleased to announce a new three-year outlook, which results in holding oil volumes flat with pro forma 2024 levels from 2025 through 2027 and annual capital expenditures of $1.4 billion per year. This outcome is a material improvement in capital efficiency and illustrates the quality and depth of our inventory. Chord is a premier Williston Basin operator with enhanced scale, significant low-cost inventory, financial strength and peer-leading shareholder returns. Chord's durable free cash flow generation is evident in our improving capital efficiency and compelling long-term financial outlook. We remain focused on optimizing capital allocation while operating in a safe and sustainable manner.\"\n\n**3Q24 Operational and Financial Update:**\n\nThe following table presents select 3Q24 operational and financial data compared to guidance released on August 7, 2024:\n\n**Metric** | **Actual** | **Guidance**  \n---|---|---  \nOil Volumes (MBopd) | 158.8 | 154.5 – 159.5  \nNGL Volumes (MBblpd) | 51.7 | 47.3 – 48.8  \nNatural Gas Volumes (MMcfpd) | 421.8 | 418.5 – 431.5  \nTotal Volumes (MBoepd) | 280.8 | 271.5 – 280.2  \nE&P & Other CapEx ($MM) | $329.2 | $335 – $365  \nOil Discount to WTI ($/Bbl) | $(1.51) | $(2.25) – $(0.25)  \nNGL Realization (% of WTI) | 8 % | 8% – 18%  \nNatural Gas Realization (% of Henry Hub) | 20 % | 35% – 45%  \nLOE ($/Boe) | $9.56 | $9.35 – $10.35  \nCash GPT ($/Boe)(1) | $2.91 | $2.65 – $3.25  \nCash G&A ($MM)(1) | $27.9 | $29.0 – $31.0  \nProduction Taxes (% of Oil, NGL and Natural Gas Sales) | 9.0 % | 8.3% – 8.7%  \nCash Interest ($MM)(1) | $19.8 | $16.0 – $18.0  \nCash Tax (% of Adjusted EBITDA)(2) | 2 % | 6% – 12%  \n  \n___________________  \n---  \n(1) | Non-GAAP financial measure. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measures under GAAP.  \n(2) | Guidance range based on NYMEX WTI between $70/Bbl – $90/Bbl.  \n  \nChord had 46 gross (36.0 net) operated turn-in-line (\"TIL\") wells in 3Q24.\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $663.2MM and net income was $225.3MM ($3.59/diluted share). Adjusted EBITDA was $674.5MM, Adjusted Free Cash Flow was $312.5MM and Adjusted Net Income was $212.8MM ($3.40/diluted share). Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Net Income are non-GAAP financial measures. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measures under GAAP.\n\n**Return of Capital:**\n\nChord declared a base-plus-variable cash dividend of $1.44 per share of common stock, including a base dividend of $1.25 per share of common stock and a variable dividend of $0.19 per share of common stock. The dividends will be payable on December 12, 2024 to shareholders of record as of November 27, 2024. Details regarding the calculation of the variable dividend can be found in the Company's most recent investor presentation located on its website at <https://ir.chordenergy.com/presentations>.During 3Q24, the Company repurchased 951,417 shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $153.50 per share totaling $146.0MM. Share repurchases represented more than 90% of shareholder returns after the base dividend in 3Q24. Chord's Board of Directors has authorized a new share repurchase program totaling $750MM, which replaces the existing program which had approximately $445MM remaining at September 30, 2024.\n\n**Acquisition and Divestiture:**\n\nDuring 3Q24, Chord entered into a definitive agreement to divest its entire position in the DJ Basin. On October 25, 2024, Chord completed the sale of the DJ Basin assets and received net proceeds (after customary purchase price adjustments) of $36.1MM. Chord expects to use the net proceeds from the DJ Basin divestiture to fund recent acquisitions and repurchase shares of common stock in 4Q24.\n\nAdditionally, during 3Q24, Chord entered into agreements to acquire additional working interests in operated assets in the Williston Basin for total cash consideration of $7.0MM, which was funded with cash on hand. The net volume impact of these portfolio changes is expected to reduce 4Q24 oil volumes by approximately 0.4 MBopd. \n\n**2025 – 2027 Outlook:**\n\nChord expects to spend $1.4B of capital per year for each of the next three years (2025 – 2027) to maintain flat pro forma FY24 oil volumes of 152 MBopd – 153 MBopd. Chord's three-year outlook reflects the improving capital efficiency of its program, supported by high-quality inventory, enhanced operational efficiencies and over $200MM of synergies from the combination with Enerplus.\n\n**Updated 2024 Outlook:**\n\nChord is updating its FY24 guidance to reflect 3Q24 results and its 4Q24 outlook. Chord expects to generate approximately $2.7B of Adjusted EBITDA and $1.1B of Adjusted Free Cash Flow on a pro forma basis in FY24, with a reinvestment rate less than 60%. Chord's updated outlook reflects actual pricing for 1Q24 – 3Q24 and $70/Bbl WTI and $2.50/MMBtu Henry Hub for 4Q24.\n\n  * Full year oil volumes updated to account for strong 3Q24 performance and the latest 4Q24 outlook, which includes the impact of October wildfires and recent A&D activity. Pro forma FY24 midpoint oil volumes of 152.7 MBopd increased 0.6 MBopd from August guidance (including the impact of A&D), representing the second increase in oil guidance this year;\n  * FY24 pro forma capital guidance reduced $10MM to $1.48B, reflecting program efficiencies and lower spending. 4Q24 capital reflects program timing and some deferred spending from 3Q24;\n  * Full year natural gas and NGL volumes adjusted to reflect latest estimates on volume mix and activity deferrals in the Marcellus shale;\n  * Lowering 4Q24 oil differentials to reflect continued pricing improvement in the Williston Basin. Adjusting 4Q24 natural gas and NGL realizations to reflect current market conditions;\n  * Lowering FY24 LOE to reflect better than expected 3Q24 performance and improved 4Q24 outlook;\n  * Increasing production tax estimate to account for higher oil sales and lower gas prices; and\n  * Lowering cash tax guidance to reflect the acceleration of certain deferred tax benefits.\n\n\n\nIn early October, wildfires spread in select areas of North Dakota. There were no injuries to Chord staff; however, the broader community suffered two fatalities and various homes and infrastructure were damaged. During the fires, Chord coordinated with authorities to proactively shut in certain sites and facilities. The impact of these curtailments reduced 4Q24 oil volumes by approximately 0.9 MBopd and is reflected in Chord's 4Q24 guidance below. \n\nThe following table presents select operational and financial guidance for 4Q24 and FY24:\n\n**Metric** | **4Q24 Guidance** | **FY24 Guidance(1)**  \n---|---|---  \nOil Volumes (MBopd) | 149.5 – 154.5 | 152.0 – 153.3  \nNGL Volumes (MBblpd) | 46.1 – 47.6 | 47.7 – 48.1  \nNatural Gas Volumes (MMcfpd) | 395.5 – 408.5 | 407.6 – 410.9  \nTotal Volumes (MBoepd) | 261.5 – 270.1 | 267.6 – 269.8  \nE&P & Other CapEx ($MM) | $315 – $355 | $1,460 – $1,500  \nOil Discount to WTI ($/Bbl) | $(2.00) – $0.00 | $(1.75) – $(1.25)  \nNGL Realization (% of WTI) | 5% – 15% | 9% – 11%  \nNatural Gas Realization (% of Henry Hub) | 25% – 35% | 34% – 36%  \nLOE ($/Boe) | $9.25 – $10.25 | $9.38 – $9.63  \nCash GPT ($/Boe)(2) | $2.60 – $3.20 | $3.11 – $3.25  \nCash G&A ($MM)(2) | $29.0 – $31.0 | $116.2 – $118.2  \nProduction Taxes (% of Oil, NGL and Natural Gas Sales) | 8.7% – 9.1% | 8.8% – 8.9%  \nCash Interest ($MM)(2) | $18.0 – $20.0 | $62.7 – $64.7  \nCash Tax (% of Adjusted EBITDA)(3) | 0% – 5% | 2% – 4%  \n  \n___________________  \n---  \n(1) | Includes the results of Enerplus for the full-year.  \n(2) | Non-GAAP financial measure.

financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. The Company believes that the foregoing are useful supplemental measures that provide an indication of the results generated by the Company's principal business activities. However, these measures are not recognized by GAAP and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP. Therefore, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other issuers. From time to time, the Company provides forward-looking forecasts of these measures; however, the Company is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because management cannot reliably quantify certain of the necessary components of such forward-looking GAAP measures. The reconciling items in future periods could be significant. To see how the Company reconciles its historical presentations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, please visit the Investors—Documents & Disclosures—Non-GAAP Reconciliation page on the Company's website at [https://ir.chordenergy.com/non-gaap](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4296201-1&h=2002817957&u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.chordenergy.com%2Fnon-gaap&a=https%3A%2F%2Fir.chordenergy.com%2Fnon-gaap). \n\n**Cash GPT**\n\nThe Company defines Cash GPT as total GPT expenses less non-cash valuation charges on pipeline imbalances and non-cash mark-to-market adjustments on transportation contracts accounted for as derivative instruments. Cash GPT is not a measure of GPT expenses as determined by GAAP. Management believes that the presentation of Cash GPT provides useful additional information to investors and analysts to assess the cash costs incurred to market and transport the Company's commodities from the wellhead to delivery points for sale without regard to the change in value of its pipeline imbalances, which vary monthly based on commodity prices, and without regard to the non-cash mark-to-market adjustments on transportation contracts classified as derivative instruments.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of GPT expenses to the non-GAAP financial measure of Cash GPT for the periods presented:\n\nView News Release Full Screen**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**(In thousands)**  \n**GPT** | $ 77,353 | $ 52,294 | $ 194,467 | $ 132,706  \nPipeline imbalances | (2,114) | 234 | (2,796) | (7,902)  \nGain (loss) on derivative transportation contracts(1) | — | (1,432) | (5,877) | 16,847  \n**Cash GPT** | **$ 75,239** | **$ 51,096** | **$ 185,794** | **$ 141,651**  \n  \n___________________  \n---  \n(1) | The Company had buy/sell transportation contracts that qualified as derivatives. The changes in the fair value of these contracts was recorded to GPT expense. As of June 30, 2024, the term of all remaining contracts expired.  \n  \n**Cash G &A**\n\nThe Company defines Cash G&A as total G&A expenses less G&A expenses directly attributable to certain merger and acquisition activity, non-cash equity-based compensation expenses and other non-cash charges. Cash G&A is not a measure of G&A expenses as determined by GAAP. Management believes that the presentation of Cash G&A provides useful additional information to investors and analysts to assess the Company's operating costs in comparison to peers without regard to the aforementioned charges, which can vary substantially from company to company.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of G&A expenses to the non-GAAP financial measure of Cash G&A for the periods presented:\n\nView News Release Full Screen**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**(In thousands)**  \n**General and administrative expenses** | $ 52,115 | $ 26,117 | $ 159,904 | $ 100,775  \nMerger costs(1) | (17,503) | — | (80,297) | (9,701)  \nEquity-based compensation expenses | (5,918) | (10,082) | (16,053) | (37,260)  \nOther non-cash adjustments | (829) | (2,292) | 633 | (4,165)  \n**Cash G &A** | **$ 27,865** | **$ 13,743** | **$ 64,187** | **$ 49,649**  \n  \n___________________  \n---  \n(1) | Includes costs directly attributable to the arrangement with Enerplus for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the costs directly attributable to the merger of equals with Whiting Petroleum Corporation (\"Whiting\") for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.  \n  \n**Cash Interest**\n\nThe Company defines Cash Interest as interest expense plus capitalized interest less amortization and write-offs of deferred financing costs. Cash Interest is not a measure of interest expense as determined by GAAP. Management believes that the presentation of Cash Interest provides useful additional information to investors and analysts for assessing the interest charges incurred on the Company's debt to finance its operating activities and the Company's ability to maintain compliance with its debt covenants.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the GAAP financial measure of interest expense to the non-GAAP financial measure of Cash Interest for the periods presented:\n\nView News Release Full Screen**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**(In thousands)**  \n**Interest expense** | $ 19,146 | $ 7,923 | $ 38,946 | $ 22,286  \nCapitalized interest | 1,839 | 857 | 3,707 | 3,601  \nAmortization of deferred financing costs | (1,140) | (1,224) | (3,398) | (3,633)  \n**Cash Interest** | **$ 19,845** | **$ 7,556** | **$ 39,255** | **$ 22,254**  \n  \n**Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow**\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (\"DD&A\"), merger costs, exploration expenses, impairment expenses and other similar non-cash or non-recurring charges. The Company defines Adjusted Free Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less Cash Interest and E&P and other capital expenditures (excluding capitalized interest and acquisition capital).\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are not measures of net income or cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow provides useful additional information to investors and analysts for assessing the Company's results of operations, financial performance, ability to generate cash from its business operations without regard to its financing methods or capital structure and the Company's ability to maintain compliance with its debt covenants.\n\nThe following table presents reconciliations of the GAAP financial measures of net income and net cash provided by operating activities to the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow for the periods presented:\n\nView News Release Full Screen**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**(In thousands)**  \n**Net income** | $ 225,316 | $ 209,076 | $ 638,030 | $ 722,146  \nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest | 19,146 | 7,923 | 38,946 | 22,286  \nIncome tax expense | 79,584 | 65,696 | 215,126 | 227,199  \nDepreciation, depletion and amortization | 360,214 | 160,293 | 757,036 | 431,131  \nMerger costs(1) | 17,503 | — | 80,297 | 9,701  \nExploration and impairment expenses | 7,269 | 1,611 | 14,908 | 33,257  \n(Gain) loss on sale of assets | 2,973 | (899) | (13,814) | (3,739)  \nNet (gain) loss on derivative instruments | (52,721) | 85,205 | (29,753) | (11,247)  \nRealized gain (loss) on commodity price derivative contracts | 953 | (63,131) | (4,305) | (206,229)  \nNet gain from investment in unconsolidated affiliate | (1,089) | (13,512) | (23,246) | (21,421)  \nDistributions from investment in unconsolidated affiliate | 2,323 | 2,515 | 6,914 | 8,499  \nEquity-based compensation expenses | 5,918 | 10,082 | 16,053 | 37,260  \nOther non-cash adjustments | 7,118 | 4,246 | 11,018 | (1,813)  \n**Adjusted EBITDA** | **674,507** | **469,105** | **1,707,210** | **1,247,030**  \nCash Interest | (19,845) | (7,556) | (39,255) | (22,254)  \nE&P and other capital expenditures | (329,187) | (254,183) | (901,245) | (713,491)  \nCash taxes paid | (13,000) | — | (38,500) | —  \n**Adjusted Free Cash Flow** | **$ 312,475** | **$ 207,366** | **$ 728,210** | **$ 511,285**  \n**Net cash provided by operating activities** | $ 663,198 | $ 399,470 | $ 1,530,772 | $ 1,276,517  \nChanges in working capital | (41,416) | 86,704 | (23,339) | 84,328  \nInterest expense, net of capitalized interest | 19,146 | 7,923 | 38,946 | 22,286  \nCurrent income tax expense | 3,401 | 34,874 | 68,243 | 50,521  \nMerger costs(1) | 17,503 | — | 80,297 | 9,701  \nExploration expenses | 1,345 | 1,611 | 5,071 | 4,292  \nRealized gain (loss) on commodity price derivative contracts | 953 | (63,131) | (4,305) | (206,229)  \nDistributions from investment in unconsolidated affiliate | 2,323 | 2,515 | 6,914 | 8,499  \nDeferred financing costs amortization and other | 936 | (5,107) | (6,407) | (1,072)  \nOther non-cash adjustments | 7,118 | 4,246 | 11,018 | (1,813)  \n**Adjusted EBITDA** | **674,507** | **469,105** | **1,707,210** | **1,247,030**  \nCash Interest | (19,845) | (7,556) | (39,255) | (22,254)  \nE&P and other capital expenditures(2) | (329,187) | (254,183) | (901,245) | (713,491)  \nCash taxes paid | (13,000) | — | (38,500) | —  \n**Adjusted Free Cash Flow** | **$ 312,475** | **$ 207,366** | **$ 728,210** | **$ 511,285**  \n  \n___________________  \n---  \n(1) | Includes costs directly attributable to the arrangement with Enerplus for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the costs directly attributable to the merger of equals with Whiting for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.  \n(2) | The nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes approximately $20.0MM of capital incurred related to divested non-operated assets that was reimbursed.  \n  \n**Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share**\n\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management and external users of the Company's financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. The Company defines Adjusted Net Income as net income after adjusting for (1) the impact of certain non-cash items, including non-cash changes in the fair value of derivative instruments, non-cash changes in the fair value of the Company's investment in an unconsolidated affiliate, impairment and other similar non-cash charges, (2) merger costs and (3) the impact of taxes based on the Company's effective tax rate applicable to those adjusting items in the same period. Adjusted Net Income is not a measure of net income as determined by GAAP.\n\nThe Company calculates earnings per share under the two-class method in accordance with GAAP. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that computes earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared (or accumulated) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share is calculated as (i) Adjusted Net Income (ii) less distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities (iii) divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the periods presented.\n\nThe following table presents reconciliations of the GAAP financial measure of net income to the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted Net Income and the GAAP financial measure of diluted earnings per share to the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share for the periods presented:\n\nView News Release Full Screen**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**(In thousands, except per share data)**  \n**Net income** | $ 225,316 | $ 209,076 | $ 638,030 | $ 722,146  \nNet (gain) loss on derivative instruments | (52,721) | 85,205 | (29,753) | (11,247)  \nRealized gain (loss) on commodity price derivative contracts | 953 | (63,131) | (4,305) | (206,229)  \nNet gain from investment in unconsolidated affiliate | (1,089) | (13,512) | (23,246) | (21,421)  \nDistributions from investment in unconsolidated affiliate | 2,323 | 2,515 | 6,914 | 8,499  \nImpairment | 5,919 | — | 9,838 | 28,964  \nMerger costs(1) | 17,503 | — | 80,297 | 9,701  \n(Gain) loss on sale of assets | 2,973 | (899) | (13,814) | (3,739)  \nAmortization of deferred financing costs | 1,140 | 1,224 | 3,398 | 3,633  \nOther non-cash adjustments | 7,118 | 4,246 | 11,018 | (1,813)  \nTax impact(2) | 4,145 | (3,742) | (9,802) | 46,270  \n**Adjusted net income** | 213,580 | 220,982 | 668,575 | 574,764  \nDistributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities | (734) | (817) | (2,681) | (1,674)  \n**Adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders** | $ 212,846 | $ 220,165 | $ 665,894 | $ 573,090  \n**Diluted earnings per share** | $ 3.60 | $ 4.79 | $ 12.39 | $ 16.59  \nNet (gain) loss on derivative instruments | (0.84) | 1.95 | (0.58) | (0.26)  \nRealized gain (loss) on commodity price derivative contracts | 0.02 | (1.45) | (0.08) | (4.74)  \nNet gain from investment in unconsolidated affiliate | (0.02) | (0.31) | (0.45) | (0.49)  \nDistributions from investment in unconsolidated affiliate | 0.04 | 0.06 | 0.13 | 0.20  \nImpairment | 0.09 | — | 0.19 | 0.67  \nMerger costs(1) | 0.28 | — | 1.56 | 0.22  \n(Gain) loss on sale of assets | 0.05 | (0.02) | (0.27) | (0.09)  \nAmortization of deferred financing costs | 0.02 | 0.03 | 0.07 | 0.08  \nOther non-cash adjustments | 0.11 | 0.10 | 0.21 | (0.04)  \nTax impact(2) | 0.06 | (0.09) | (0.19) | 1.06  \n**Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share** | 3.41 | 5.06 | 12.98 | 13.20  \nLess: Distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities | (0.01) | (0.02) | (0.05) | (0.04)  \n**Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share** | $ 3.40 | $ 5.04 | $ 12.93 | $ 13.16  \nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding | 62,629 | 43,662 | 51,507 | 43,527  \nEffective tax rate applicable to adjustment items(2) | 26.1 % | 23.9 % | 25.2 % | 23.9 %  \n  \n_____________________  \n---  \n(1) | Includes costs directly attributable to the arrangement with Enerplus for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the costs directly attributable to the merger of equals with Whiting for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.  \n(2) | The tax impact is computed utilizing the Company's effective tax rate applicable to the adjustments for certain non-cash and non-recurring items.  \n  \nSOURCE Chord Energy\n\n[Back to All News](https://ir.chordenergy.com/news-releases)\n\nInvestor Quick Links\n\n[Read more](corporate-governance)\n\nCorporate Governance \n\n[Read more](corporate-governance)\n\n[Read more](shareholder-services)\n\nShareholder Services\n\n[Read more](shareholder-services)\n\n[Read more](sec-filings)\n\nFinancial Information\n\n[Read more](sec-filings)\n"

          "content": "On July 1, 2022, Chord Energy Corporation, formerly known as Oasis Petroleum Inc. (“Chord\nEnergy”) completed its “merger of equals” transaction (the “Merger”) with Whiting Petroleum\nCorporation (“Whiting”). In connection with the Merger, Chord Energy assumed two series of\noutstanding warrants from Whiting (the “legacy Whiting warrants”), each exercisable for shares of\nChord Energy common stock. On September 1, 2024, the Legacy Whiting Series A Warrants\nexpired. See “When do the warrants expire” below for additional information. In addition, Chord\nalso continued to hold outstanding Oasis warrants that were outstanding prior to July 1, 2022 (the\n“legacy Oasis warrants”).\nThis FAQ aims to provide answers to frequently asked questions about warrants, as well as\ninformation surrounding the legacy Whiting warrants and the legacy Oasis warrants in connection\nwith the Merger. The information contained in this FAQ is not intended to be complete or considered\ninvestment advice and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full texts of the warrant\nagreements included at the end of this FAQ. For specific questions regarding transactions with\nwarrants, please consult your financial advisor.\nQ: What is a warrant?\nA: Each warrant entitles the holder, subject to certain terms, to acquire from Chord Energy a certain\nnumber of shares of common stock at the warrant’s exercise price. The exercise price and number\nof shares of common stock obtainable upon exercise will be adjusted from time to time based on\ncertain events.\nQ: How do I exercise my warrants? Do they exercise automatically?\nA: Warrants will not be exercised automatically. The warrant holder will determine if and when to\nexercise their warrants. Warrants must be exercised through the holder’s broker. Warrants cannot\nbe exercised through Chord Energy. Specific instructions for exercising a warrant can be found in\nthe warrant agreements included at the end of this FAQ or by contacting your warrant agent.\nQ: What are options to exercise/sell the warrants? Is payment required?\nA:\n• Warrants can be exercised through the warrant holder’s broker by submitting an exercise\nform, payment, and other necessary information.\n• A cashless exercise option is also available, which provides the warrant holder a certain\nnumber of Chord Energy shares based on the number of warrants exercised times the\ndifference between the current market price and the exercise price of the warrant. Cash is\ndistributed for any portion of value that is less than the market price of one Chord share.\n• Warrant holders have the option of selling warrants in the open market through their broker.\n• More details about exercise options can be found in the warrant agreement (links provided\nat the end of this FAQ).\nQ: What are the tax implications of warrants?\nA: Chord Energy does not provide tax advice. Please consult your financial advisor for questions\nrelated to tax implications.\nQ: What happened to Whiting warrants held prior to the Merger?\nA: Former Whiting warrants were assumed pursuant to an assignment and assumption agreement\nby Chord Energy and Whiting. The Legacy Whiting Series B warrants continue to trade under the\nsame symbol (WLLBW) as before the Merger. The Legacy Whiting Series A warrants expired on\nSeptember 1, 2024. The number of Chord Energy shares into which the legacy Whiting warrants are\nexercisable and the exercise prices were adjusted based on the Merger exchange ratio. As a result,\neach Whiting warrant is exercisable for 0.5774 shares of Chord Energy common stock. The entire\ntext of the assignment and assumption agreement can be accessed through the link below:\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1255474/000119312522189511/d306292dex103.htm\nQ: What is the exercise price for my warrants?\nA: The following table highlights the exercise prices as of September 1, 2024.

Metrics and disclosures included\nin this index cover Chord Energy upstream E&P operations for the calendar year that ended on December 31, 2023.\n2023 2023\nGREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SAFETY\nScope 1 GHG Emissions (Metrics tons CO e) 1,500,209 Employee TRIR –\n2\n# of Employee OSHA Recordable Cases x 200,000 / Annual Employee Workhours\nScope 1 GHG Intensity: Scope 1 GHG Emissions (Metric tons CO e)/Gross Annual 17.34\n2 Contractor TRIR 0.55\nProduction as Reported Under Subpart W (MBoe)\n# of Contractor OSHA Recordable Cases x 200,000 / Annual Contractor Workhours\nPercent of Scope 1 GHG Emissions Attributed to Boosting and Gathering Segment 0% Combined TRIR 0.46\n# of Combined OSHA Recordable Cases x 200,000 / Annual Combined Workhours\nScope 2 GHG Emissions (Metrics tons CO e) 282,658\n2\nScopes 1 & 2 Combined GHG Intensity: (Scope 1 GHG Emissions (Metric tons CO e) + 20.61\n2 SUPPORTING DATA\nScope 2 GHG Emissions (Metric tons CO e)/Gross Annual Production as Reported\n2\nUnder Subpart W (MBoe)\nGross Annual Oil Production (Bbl) 56,627,225\nScope 1 Methane Emissions (Metric tons CH ) 10,053\n4 Gross Annual Gas Production (Mcf) 180,233,606\nScope 1 Methane Intensity: Scope 1 Methane Emissions (Metric tons CH )/Gross 0.12\nAnnual Production – As Reported Under Subpart W (MBoe) 4 Gross Annual Production (Boe) 86,666,159\nPercent of Scope 1 Methane Emissions Attributed to Boosting 0% Gross Annual Production (MBoe) 86,666\nand Gathering Segment\nGross Annual Production – As Reported Under Subpart W (MBoe) 86,506\nFLARING Total Produced Liquids (MBbl) 156,112\nProduced Liquids Spilled (Bbl) 45\nGross Annual Volume of Flared Gas (Mcf) 7,832,362\nFresh Water Consumed (Bbl) 55,464,061\nPercentage of gas flared per Mcf of gas produced 4.35%\nGross Annual Volume of Flared Gas (Mcf)/Gross Annual Gas Production (Mcf)\nRecycled Water (Bbl) 696,131\nVolume of gas flared per barrel of oil equivalent produced 0.090\nTotal Water Consumed (Bbl) 56,160,192\nGross Annual Volume of Flared Gas (Mcf)/Gross Annual Production (Boe)\nEmployee OSHA Recordable Cases –\nSPILL\nContractor OSHA Recordable Cases 13\nSpill Intensity 0.000 Combined OSHA Recordable Cases 13\nProduced Liquids Spilled (Bbl)/Total Produced Liquids (MBbl)\nAnnual Employee Workhours 963,288\nAnnual Contractor Workhours 4,747,027\nWATER USE\nMethodology Actuals\nFresh Water Intensity 0.640\nFresh Water Consumed (Bbl)/Gross Annual Production (Boe) Annual Combined Workhours 5,710,315\nWater Recycle Rate: Recycled Water (Bbl)/Total Water Consumed (Bbl) 1.2%\nForm last updated January 2024\nDoes your company use WRI Aqueduct, GEMI, Water Risk Filter, Water Risk Yes\nMonetizer, or other comparable tool or methodology to determine the water\nstressed areas in your portfolio?\nSustainability Report 2023 | 71\nIntroduction Climate-Related Environmental Social Governance Data &\nRisks Disclosures\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this report and oral statements made in connection therewith are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other\nthan statements of historical facts, included in this report that address activities, events, or developments that we expect, believe, or anticipate will or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements. In\nparticular, this report contains forward-looking statements pertaining to, but not limited to, information regarding the Company’s expectations with respect to our current and future operations, performance and\nbusiness strategy, and the Company’s practices, programs, policies, initiatives, plans, goals, targets, and commitments to monitor and report progress thereon, including those with respect to ESG matters including,\namong others, those related to reporting according to certain frameworks, GHG emissions reduction and air quality, flare management, water management, spill prevention and management, biodiversity and land\nuse, waste management, health and safety, contractor management, diversity, equity and inclusion, community engagement and social investment, risk management, cybersecurity, and management of our\nsupply chain. Words such as “could,” “would,” “should,” “may,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “continue,” “potential,” “future,” “strategy,” “goal,” “plan,” and similar expressions that are predictions of or indicate future\nevents and trends may be used to identify forward-looking statements in this report, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words.\nThe actual conduct of our activities, including the development, implementation, progress towards, or continuation of any practices, programs, policies, initiatives, plans, goals, or targets discussed or forecasted in\nthis report may differ materially in the future. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance\ncan be given that such assumptions are accurate or that any of such expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct. Therefore, the reader should not place undue reliance on these\nforward-looking statements. Moreover, many of the assumptions, standards, methodologies, metrics, and measurements used in preparing this report continue to evolve and are based on assumptions believed to\nbe reasonable at the time of preparation, but should not be considered guarantees.\nThese forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, many of which are outside of the Company’s control.\nSuch risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, public health crises such as pandemics (including COVID-19), epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases, natural disasters and adverse weather\nconditions, terrorist attacks or cyber-attacks, substantial or extended declines in commodity prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, the ability to attract and retain key personnel, risks related to the\nCompany’s public statements with respect to such matters that may be subject to heightened scrutiny from public and governmental authorities related to the risk of potential “greenwashing”, i.e., misleading\ninformation or false claims overstating potential ESG and sustainability-related benefits, which could lead to increased litigation risk from private parties and governmental authorities or regulatory bodies related to\nthe Company’s ESG and sustainability-related efforts, and other factors. These and other applicable risks, uncertainties, and assumptions are described more fully in the Company’s filings with the Securities and\nExchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and any subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. As a result of these factors,\nactual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements.\nWhile this report describes potential future events and matters that may be significant, and with respect to which we may even use the word “material” or “materiality”, the potential significance of these events and\nmatters should not be read as equating to “materiality” as the concept is used in connection with the Company’s required disclosures made in response to SEC and exchange rules and regulations.\nMoreover, while we have provided information on several ESG topics, including goals and ambitions, there are inherent uncertainties in providing such information, due to the complexity and novelty of many\nmethodologies established for collecting, measuring, and analyzing ESG-related data. While we anticipate continuing to monitor and report on certain ESG-related information, we cannot guarantee that such data\nwill be consistent year-to-year, as methodologies and expectations continue to evolve. Furthermore, there are sources of uncertainty and limitations that exist that are beyond our control and could impact the\nCompany’s plans and timelines, including the reliance on technological and regulatory advancements and market participants’ behaviors and preferences.\nOur forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and the Company undertakes no obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to update or revise our forward-looking statements, whether\nas a result of new information, subsequent events, anticipated or unanticipated circumstances, or otherwise. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such factors. The ESG\nmetrics included in this report have not been independently audited or prepared in accordance with GAAP, unless indicated otherwise. Some of the data provided in this report may be estimated or reliant on\nestimated information, which is inherently imprecise. While we endeavor to note throughout this report where such estimates are made, we cannot guarantee that estimates are identified as such in every instance.\nFurthermore, unless explicitly noted in each instance where it occurs, the relevant sustainability or ESG-related data provided in this report has not been audited or subject to any third-party assurance process. In\nsome cases, the information is prepared, or based on information prepared, by third-party vendors and consultants and is not independently verified by the Company. The Company makes no representation or\nwarranty as to third-party information. Unless otherwise provided, the information contained in this report is expressly not incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company made with the SEC, or any other\nfiling, report, application, or statement made by the Company to any federal, state, tribal, or local governmental authority.\nSustainability Report 2023 | 72\n1001 Fannin Street, Suite 1500\nHouston, Texas 77002\nchordenergy.com"
