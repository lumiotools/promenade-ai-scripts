Reports Fiscal Third Quarter 2024 Results\n\nOctober 31, 2024\n\n[ Download (opens in new window) ](//s201.q4cdn.com/421727654/files/doc_news/BJs-Restaurants-Inc.-Reports-Fiscal-Third-Quarter-2024-Results-2024.pdf)\n\nHUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., Oct. 31, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ: BJRI) today reported financial results for its fiscal 2024 third quarter ended Tuesday, October 1, 2024.\n\n**Fiscal Third Quarter 2024 Compared to Fiscal Third Quarter 2023**\n\n  * Total revenues increased 2.2% to $325.7 million\n  * Comparable restaurant sales increased 1.7%\n  * Total restaurant operating weeks increased 0.2%\n  * Net loss of $2.9 million, compared to $3.8 million; diluted net loss per share of $0.13, compared to $0.16 \n    * Third quarter 2024 net loss includes a $0.4 million pretax, or $0.02 per share, net leadership transition benefit.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $18.5 million, compared to $19.6 million\n\n\n\n“Our third quarter results mark progress with our sales building initiatives, which drove positive comparable restaurant sales and guest traffic that accelerated through the quarter,” commented Brad Richmond, Interim Chief Executive Officer. “In the current competitive environment, BJ’s value programs are resonating with guests, demonstrated by our third quarter traffic exceeding the industry by approximately 570 basis points. We did not fully leverage our strong traffic growth due to higher than anticipated restaurant costs, which we are addressing. As a result, we generated modestly higher dollar restaurant level operating margin but lower percentage margin compared to a year ago. As our sales momentum continues to build behind the Pizookie Meal Deal, successful product launches, and a large party initiative going into the holiday season, we are focused on delighting our guests while delivering meaningful profit growth. Restoring higher restaurant level margins is a top priority, which we will accomplish through a disciplined financial approach. As a result, we expect to demonstrate favorable profit momentum in the fourth quarter,” continued Richmond.\n\n“Our new President and Chief Concept Officer, Lyle Tick, and I have been immersed in onboarding and spending significant time in our restaurants with BJ’s fantastic team members and loyal guests. We are undertaking a comprehensive assessment of BJ’s underlying strengths and the opportunities in front of us as we usher in a chapter of renewed growth. We are confident that the strength of our brand and teams, combined with a refined business strategy, will lay the foundation for future sales and earnings growth. We are focused on driving greater awareness of the BJ’s brand, while adhering to strict operational and financial discipline to drive improved profitability and position the Company for accelerated new unit restaurant openings in the future. Success on these initiatives will unlock BJ’s potential thereby elevating its trajectory as a restaurant growth company and driving long-term shareholder value creation,” continued Richmond.\n\n“In the third quarter, we opened two new restaurants for a total of three new restaurants in 2024. Our 2024 restaurant class is off to an encouraging start and demonstrating the strength of the BJ’s brand with new and existing guests,” continued Richmond. “Our capital allocation strategy will continue to prioritize high-return investments including a mix of new restaurant growth and remodels, as well as returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program. The pace of these programs will be shaped by further and ongoing evaluation of unit productivity, financial return performance and future concept refinement,” concluded Richmond.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased and retired approximately 268,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $8.2 million. The Company currently has approximately $44 million available under its authorized $550 million share repurchase program.\n\n**Investor Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nBJ’s Restaurants, Inc. will conduct a conference call on its third quarter 2024 earnings release today, October 31, 2024, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time).

These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. These measures should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures.\n\n**Restaurant Level Operating Margin**\n\nRestaurant level operating margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, is equal to the revenues generated by our restaurants less their direct operating costs which consist of cost of sales, labor and benefits, and occupancy and operating costs. This performance measure primarily includes the costs that restaurant level managers can directly control and excludes other operating costs that are essential to conduct the Company’s business, as detailed in the table below. Management uses restaurant level operating margin as a supplemental measure of restaurant performance. Management believes restaurant level operating margin is useful to investors in that it highlights trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent to investors when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. Because other companies may calculate restaurant level operating margin differently than we do, restaurant level operating margin as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nA reconciliation of (loss) income from operations to restaurant level operating margin for the third quarter ended October 1 2024, and October 3, 2023, is set forth below:\n\n**Supplemental Financial Information – Restaurant Level Operating Margin**  \n---  \n**(Unaudited, dollars in thousands)**  \n**Third Quarter Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n**October 1, 2024**| **October 3, 2023**| **October 1, 2024**| **October 3, 2023**  \n(Loss) income from operations| $| (2,608| )| (0.8| )%| $| (2,387| )| (0.7| )%| $| 18,871|  1.9| %| $| 10,441| 1.0| %  \nGeneral and administrative| 20,960| 6.4| 19,473| 6.1| 64,561| 6.4| 60,373| 6.0  \nDepreciation and amortization| 18,193| 5.6| 17,879| 5.6| 54,229| 5.4| 53,199| 5.3  \nRestaurant opening| 1,115| 0.3| 1,379| 0.4| 2,005| 0.2| 2,601| 0.3  \nLoss on disposal and impairment of assets, net| 329| 0.1| 1,430| 0.4| 3,041| 0.3| 4,706| 0.5  \nRestaurant level operating margin| $| 37,989| 11.7| %| $| 37,774| 11.9| %| $| 142,707| 14.1| %| $| 131,320| 13.0| %  \n  \nPercentages above represent percent of total revenues and may not reconcile due to rounding.\n\n**Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”)**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents the sum of net (loss) income adjusted for certain expenses and gains/losses detailed within the reconciliation below. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance. Management believes these measures are useful to investors in that they highlight cash flow and trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent to investors when relying solely on GAAP financial measures.

Reports Fiscal Third Quarter 2024 Results\n\nOctober 31, 2024\n\n[ Download (opens in new window) ](//s201.q4cdn.com/421727654/files/doc_news/BJs-Restaurants-Inc.-Reports-Fiscal-Third-Quarter-2024-Results-2024.pdf)\n\nHUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif., Oct. 31, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ: BJRI) today reported financial results for its fiscal 2024 third quarter ended Tuesday, October 1, 2024.\n\n**Fiscal Third Quarter 2024 Compared to Fiscal Third Quarter 2023**\n\n  * Total revenues increased 2.2% to $325.7 million\n  * Comparable restaurant sales increased 1.7%\n  * Total restaurant operating weeks increased 0.2%\n  * Net loss of $2.9 million, compared to $3.8 million; diluted net loss per share of $0.13, compared to $0.16 \n    * Third quarter 2024 net loss includes a $0.4 million pretax, or $0.02 per share, net leadership transition benefit.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $18.5 million, compared to $19.6 million\n\n\n\n“Our third quarter results mark progress with our sales building initiatives, which drove positive comparable restaurant sales and guest traffic that accelerated through the quarter,” commented Brad Richmond, Interim Chief Executive Officer. “In the current competitive environment, BJ’s value programs are resonating with guests, demonstrated by our third quarter traffic exceeding the industry by approximately 570 basis points. We did not fully leverage our strong traffic growth due to higher than anticipated restaurant costs, which we are addressing. As a result, we generated modestly higher dollar restaurant level operating margin but lower percentage margin compared to a year ago. As our sales momentum continues to build behind the Pizookie Meal Deal, successful product launches, and a large party initiative going into the holiday season, we are focused on delighting our guests while delivering meaningful profit growth. Restoring higher restaurant level margins is a top priority, which we will accomplish through a disciplined financial approach. As a result, we expect to demonstrate favorable profit momentum in the fourth quarter,” continued Richmond.\n\n“Our new President and Chief Concept Officer, Lyle Tick, and I have been immersed in onboarding and spending significant time in our restaurants with BJ’s fantastic team members and loyal guests. We are undertaking a comprehensive assessment of BJ’s underlying strengths and the opportunities in front of us as we usher in a chapter of renewed growth. We are confident that the strength of our brand and teams, combined with a refined business strategy, will lay the foundation for future sales and earnings growth. We are focused on driving greater awareness of the BJ’s brand, while adhering to strict operational and financial discipline to drive improved profitability and position the Company for accelerated new unit restaurant openings in the future. Success on these initiatives will unlock BJ’s potential thereby elevating its trajectory as a restaurant growth company and driving long-term shareholder value creation,” continued Richmond.\n\n“In the third quarter, we opened two new restaurants for a total of three new restaurants in 2024. Our 2024 restaurant class is off to an encouraging start and demonstrating the strength of the BJ’s brand with new and existing guests,” continued Richmond. “Our capital allocation strategy will continue to prioritize high-return investments including a mix of new restaurant growth and remodels, as well as returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program. The pace of these programs will be shaped by further and ongoing evaluation of unit productivity, financial return performance and future concept refinement,” concluded Richmond.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased and retired approximately 268,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $8.2 million. The Company currently has approximately $44 million available under its authorized $550 million share repurchase program.\n\n**Investor Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nBJ’s Restaurants, Inc. will conduct a conference call on its third quarter 2024 earnings release today, October 31, 2024, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time).

These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. These measures should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with corresponding GAAP measures.\n\n**Restaurant Level Operating Margin**\n\nRestaurant level operating margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, is equal to the revenues generated by our restaurants less their direct operating costs which consist of cost of sales, labor and benefits, and occupancy and operating costs. This performance measure primarily includes the costs that restaurant level managers can directly control and excludes other operating costs that are essential to conduct the Company’s business, as detailed in the table below. Management uses restaurant level operating margin as a supplemental measure of restaurant performance. Management believes restaurant level operating margin is useful to investors in that it highlights trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent to investors when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. Because other companies may calculate restaurant level operating margin differently than we do, restaurant level operating margin as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nA reconciliation of (loss) income from operations to restaurant level operating margin for the third quarter ended October 1 2024, and October 3, 2023, is set forth below:\n\n**Supplemental Financial Information – Restaurant Level Operating Margin**  \n---  \n**(Unaudited, dollars in thousands)**  \n**Third Quarter Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n**October 1, 2024**| **October 3, 2023**| **October 1, 2024**| **October 3, 2023**  \n(Loss) income from operations| $| (2,608| )| (0.8| )%| $| (2,387| )| (0.7| )%| $| 18,871|  1.9| %| $| 10,441| 1.0| %  \nGeneral and administrative| 20,960| 6.4| 19,473| 6.1| 64,561| 6.4| 60,373| 6.0  \nDepreciation and amortization| 18,193| 5.6| 17,879| 5.6| 54,229| 5.4| 53,199| 5.3  \nRestaurant opening| 1,115| 0.3| 1,379| 0.4| 2,005| 0.2| 2,601| 0.3  \nLoss on disposal and impairment of assets, net| 329| 0.1| 1,430| 0.4| 3,041| 0.3| 4,706| 0.5  \nRestaurant level operating margin| $| 37,989| 11.7| %| $| 37,774| 11.9| %| $| 142,707| 14.1| %| $| 131,320| 13.0| %  \n  \nPercentages above represent percent of total revenues and may not reconcile due to rounding.\n\n**Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”)**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents the sum of net (loss) income adjusted for certain expenses and gains/losses detailed within the reconciliation below. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance. Management believes these measures are useful to investors in that they highlight cash flow and trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent to investors when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. Because other companies may calculate these measures differently than we do, Adjusted EBITDA as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nA reconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter ended October 1, 2024, and October 3, 2023, is set forth below:\n\n**Supplemental Financial Information – Net (Loss) Income to Adjusted EBITDA**  \n---  \n**(Unaudited, dollars in thousands)**  \n**Third Quarter Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n**October 1, 2024**| **October 3, 2023**| **October 1, 2024**| **October 3, 2023**  \nNet (loss) income| $| (2,927| )| (0.9| )%| $| (3,804| )| (1.2| )%| $| 21,953| 2.2| %| $| 11,609| 1.1| %  \nInterest expense, net| 1,342| 0.4| 1,013| 0.3| 4,012| 0.4| 3,242| 0.3  \nIncome tax (benefit) expense| (260| )| (0.1| )| 401| 0.1| (2,863| )| (0.3| )| (3,595| )| (0.4| )  \nDepreciation and amortization| 18,193| 5.6| 17,879| 5.6| 54,229| 5.4| 53,199| 5.3  \nLeadership transition expenses, net| 1,688| 0.5| -| -| 1,688| 0.2| -| -  \nStock-based compensation expense| 3,005| 0.9| 2,669| 0.8| 8,249| 0.8| 8,089| 0.8  \nStock-based compensation credit (1)| (2,093| )| (0.6| )| -| -| (2,093| )| (0.2| )| -| -  \nOther (income) expenses, net| (763| )| (0.2| )| 3| -| (4,231| )| (0.4| )| (815| )| (0.1| )  \nLoss on disposal and impairment of assets, net| 329| 0.1| 1,430| 0.4| 3,041| 0.3| 4,706| 0.5  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 18,514| 5.7| %| $| 19,591| 6.1| %| $| 83,985| 8.3| %| $| 76,435| 7.6| %  \n  \nPercentages above represent percent of total revenues and may not reconcile due to rounding.\n\n(1) Amount relates to stock-based compensation forfeited due to leadership transition.\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI2NTYyNCM2NTYwMDU5IzIwMDY1MjI=) ![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/YWJkNzhkZDMtYmUyMi00ZDBiLWI3YWEtOWEzODE5ZTkzYzAyLTEwMTgwOTU=/tiny/BJ-s-Restaurants-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/6d209659-22c8-4e30-ba10-1f59d0b33f1c/small/bjslogo-1-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/6d209659-22c8-4e30-ba10-1f59d0b33f1c)\n\nSource: BJ's Restaurants, Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://investors.bjsrestaurants.com/news/default.aspx)\n\n## IR Contact\n\ninvestorrelations@bjsrestaurants.com [ (714) 500-2400 ](tel:714-500-2400 )\n\n## Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. (referred to herein as the “Company,” “we,” “us”\nand “our”) and our wholly owned subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements presented herein include all material adjustments (consisting of normal\nrecurring adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of our financial condition, results of operations, shareholders’\nequity and cash flows for the periods presented. Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation\nS-X. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been omitted\npursuant to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions for the reporting periods covered\nby the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual amounts could\ndiffer from these estimates. Our operating results for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024 may not be indicative of operating results for the entire year.\nA description of our accounting policies and other financial information is included in our audited consolidated financial statements filed with the SEC on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2024. The disclosures included in our accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and footnotes should be\nread in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other reports filed from\ntime to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n2. REVENUE RECOGNITION\nOur revenues are comprised of food and beverage sales from our restaurants, including takeout, delivery and catering sales. Revenues from restaurant sales are\nrecognized when payment is tendered. Amounts paid with a credit card are recorded in accounts and other receivables until payment is collected from the credit\ncard processor. We sell gift cards which do not have an expiration date, and we do not deduct non-usage fees from outstanding gift card balances. Gift card sales\nare recorded as a liability and recognized as revenues upon redemption in our restaurants. Based on historical redemption rates, a portion of our gift card sales\nare not expected to be redeemed and will be recognized as gift card “breakage.” Estimated gift card breakage is recorded as revenue and recognized in\nproportion to our historical redemption pattern, unless there is a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to government authorities.\nOur “BJ’s Premier Rewards Plus” guest loyalty program enables participants to earn points for qualifying purchases that can be redeemed for food and\nbeverages in the future. We allocate the transaction price between the goods delivered and the future goods that will be delivered on a relative standalone selling\nprice basis, and defer the revenues allocated to the points, less expected expirations, until such points are redeemed.\nThe liability related to our gift card and loyalty program, included in “Accrued expenses” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets is as follows (in thousands):\nOctober 1, 2024 January 2, 2024\nGift card liability $ 9,793 $ 14,380\nDeferred loyalty revenue $ 2,735 $ 2,510\nRevenue recognized for the redemption of gift cards and loyalty rewards deferred at the beginning of each respective fiscal year is as follows (in thousands):\nFor the Thirteen Weeks Ended For the Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended\nOctober 1, 2024 October 3, 2023 October 1, 2024 October 3, 2023\nRevenue recognized from gift card liability $ 1,405 $ 1,493 $ 9,308 $ 9,923\nRevenue recognized from guest loyalty program $ 906 $ 929 $ 6,220 $ 6,239\n3. LEASES\nWe determine if a contract contains a lease at inception. Our material operating leases consist of restaurant locations and office space. U.S. GAAP requires that\nour leases be evaluated and classified as operating or finance leases for financial reporting purposes. The classification evaluation begins at the commencement\ndate, and the lease term used in the evaluation includes the non-cancellable\n6\nperiod for which we have the right to use the underlying asset, together with optional lease term extension periods when the exercise of the lease term extension\nis reasonably certain and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty. All of our restaurant and office space leases are classified as\noperating leases. We have elected to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for office and beverage gas equipment. We do not\nhave any finance leases.\nLease costs included in “Occupancy and operating” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations consisted of the following (in thousands):\nFor the Thirteen Weeks Ended For the Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended\nOctober 1, 2024 October 3, 2023 October 1, 2024 October 3, 2023\nLease cost $ 14,315 $ 15,133 $ 43,146 $ 44,817\nVariable lease cost 834 700 2,626 3,107\nTotal lease costs $ 15,149 $ 15,833 $ 45,772 $ 47,924\n4. LONG-TERM DEBT\nLine of Credit\nOn November 3, 2021, we entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Credit Facility”) with Bank of America, N.A. (“BofA”), JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A., and certain other parties to amend and restate our revolving line of credit (the “Line of Credit”) to improve the pricing, extend the maturity\ndate, change the interest reference rate, eliminate certain financial covenants and conditions, and reset other financial covenants starting with the fourth quarter\nof 2021.\nOur Credit Facility matures on November 3, 2026, and provides us with revolving loan commitments totaling $215 million, which may be increased up to $315\nmillion, of which $50 million may be used for the issuance of letters of credit. Availability under the Credit Facility is reduced by outstanding letters of credit,\nwhich are used to support our self-insurance programs. On October 1, 2024, there were borrowings of $66.5 million and letters of credit of $17.2 million\noutstanding, leaving $131.3 million available to borrow.\nBorrowings under the Line of Credit bear interest at an annual rate equal to either (a) the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index rate (“BSBY”) plus a\npercentage not to exceed 2.00% (with a floor on BSBY of 0.00%), or (b) a percentage not to exceed 1.00% above a Base Rate equal to the highest of (i) the\nFederal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1.00%, (ii) BofA’s Prime Rate, (iii) the BSBY rate plus 1.00%, and (iv) 1.00%, in either case depending on the level of lease and\ndebt obligations of the Company as compared to EBITDA plus lease expenses. The weighted average interest rate during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1,\n2024 and October 3, 2023 was approximately 6.9% and 6.6%, respectively. Effective October 29, 2024, we amended our Credit Facility to replace the referenced\ninterest rate from BSBY, which will no longer be reported effective in November 2024, to a term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”). See Note\n11 for further information.\nThe Credit Facility is secured by the Company’s assets and contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a Fixed\nCharge Coverage Ratio and a Lease Adjusted Leverage Ratio. On October 1, 2024, we were in compliance with these covenants.\nPursuant to the Line of Credit, we are required to pay certain customary fees and expenses associated with maintenance and use of the Line of Credit, including\nletter of credit issuance fees, unused commitment fees and interest, which are payable monthly. Interest expense and commitment fees under the Credit Facility\nwere approximately $4.0 million and $3.2 million, for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024 and October 3, 2023, respectively. We also capitalized\napproximately $0.2 million and $0.4 million of interest expense related to new restaurant construction during each of the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1,\n2024 and October 3, 2023, respectively.\n5. NET INCOME PER SHARE\nBasic and diluted net (loss) income per share is calculated by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during\nthe period. Potentially dilutive shares are excluded from the computation of diluted net (loss) per share since they have an anti-dilutive effect, yet potentially\ndilutive shares are included in the computation of diluted net income per share. The number of diluted shares reflects the potential dilution that could occur if\nholders of in-the-money options and warrants were to exercise their right to convert these instruments into common stock and the restrictions on restricted stock\nunits (“RSUs”) were to lapse. Additionally, performance-based RSUs are considered contingent shares; therefore, at each reporting date we determine the\nprobable number of shares that will vest and include these contingently issuable shares in our diluted share calculation unless they are anti-dilutive. Once these\nperformance-based RSUs vest, they are included in our basic net income (loss) per share calculation.\n7\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of basic and diluted net (loss) income per share, including the number of dilutive equity awards included in the\ndilutive net (loss) income per share computation (in thousands):\nFor the Thirteen Weeks Ended For the Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended\nOctober 1, 2024 October 3, 2023 October 1, 2024 October 3, 2023\nNumerator:\nNet (loss) income $ (2,927) $ (3,804) $ 21,953 $ 11,609\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average shares outstanding – basic 23,111 23,542 23,246 23,521\nDilutive effect of equity awards — — 618 465\nWeighted-average shares outstanding – diluted 23,111 23,542 23,864 23,986\nNet (loss) income per share:\nBasic $ (0.13) $ (0.16) $ 0.94 $ 0.49\nDiluted $ (0.13) $ (0.16) $ 0.92 $ 0.48\nFor each of the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024 and October 3, 2023, there were approximately 1.0 million and 1.8 million, respectively, of equity awards\nthat were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share because they were anti-dilutive. For each of the thirty-nine weeks ended October\n1, 2024 and October 3, 2023, there were approximately 1.0 million and 1.8 million, respectively, of equity awards that were excluded from the calculation of\ndiluted net income per share because they were anti-dilutive.\n6. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nOur current shareholder approved stock-based compensation plan is the BJ’s Restaurants, Inc. 2024 Equity Incentive Plan, (as it may be amended from time to\ntime, “the Plan”). Under the Plan, we may issue shares of our common stock to team members, officers, directors and consultants. We have historically granted\nincentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, and service- and performance-based RSUs. In Fiscal 2024, we also granted market-based RSUs. Stock\noptions are charged against the Plan share reserve on the basis of one share for each share of common stock issuable upon exercise of options granted. All\noptions granted under the Plan expire within 10 years of their date of grant. Awards of stock options or stock appreciation rights are charged against the Plan\nshare reserve on the basis of one share for each share granted. All other awards are charged against the 2024 Plan share reserve on the basis of 1.5 shares for\neach share granted. The Plan also contains other limits on the terms of incentive grants such as the maximum number that can be granted to a team member\nduring any fiscal year.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options, and we use the Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the\nfair value of our performance-based RSUs, which include a market-based metric. Both models require assumptions to be made regarding our stock price\nvolatility, the expected life of the award, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend rates. The fair value of service-based and performance-based RSUs granted\nis equal to the fair value of our common stock at market close on the date of grant or the last trading day prior to the date of grant when grants take place on a\nday when the market is closed. The grant date fair value of each stock option, market-based and service-based RSU is expensed over the vesting period (e.g.,\none, three or five years) and the fair value of each performance-based RSU is expensed based on the estimated quantity that is expected to vest corresponding\nwith management's current estimate of the level that the performance goal will be achieved.\nThe following table presents the stock-based compensation recognized within our consolidated financial statements (in thousands):\nFor the Thirteen Weeks Ended For the Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended\nOctober 1, 2024 October 3, 2023 October 1, 2024 October 3, 2023\nLabor and benefits $ 727 $ 577 $ 1,764 $ 1,853\nGeneral and administrative $ 185 $ 2,092 $ 4,392 $ 6,236\nCapitalized (1) $ 92 $ 97 $ 255 $ 285\nTotal stock-based compensation $ 1,004 $ 2,766 $ 6,411 $ 8,374\n(1) Capitalized stock-based compensation relates to our restaurant development personnel and is included in “Property and equipment, net” on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\nStock Options\nThe fair value of each stock option was estimated on the grant date using the Black‑Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average\nassumptions:\n8\nFor the Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended\nOctober 1, 2024 October 3, 2023\nVolatility 67.5% 66.9%\nRisk-free interest rate 3.9% 3.5%\nExpected life (years) 5 5\nExpected dividend yield —% —%\nFair value of options granted $ 18.86 $ 18.31\nUnder our stock-based compensation plan, the exercise price of a stock option is required to equal or exceed the fair value of our common stock at market close\non the option grant date or the last trading day prior to the date of grant when grants take place on a day when the market is closed.

INCOME TAXES\nWe calculate our interim income tax provision in accordance with ASC Topic 270, “Interim Reporting” and ASC Topic 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”\nThe related tax expense or benefit is recognized in the interim period in which it occurs. In addition, the effect of changes in enacted tax laws, rates or tax status\nis recognized in the interim period in which the change occurs. The computation of the annual estimated effective tax rate at each interim period requires\nsignificant estimates and judgment including estimating the expected operating income for the year, permanent and temporary differences because of differences\nbetween amounts measured and recognized in accordance with tax laws and financial accounting standards, and the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets\ngenerated in the current fiscal year. The accounting estimates used to compute income tax expense may change as new events occur, additional information is\nobtained or the tax environment changes.\nOur effective income tax rate for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024 was a benefit of 15.0% compared to a benefit rate of 44.9% for the comparable\nthirty-nine weeks ended October 3, 2023. The effective tax rate benefit for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024 and October 3, 2023, was different from\nthe statutory tax rate primarily as a result of significant Federal Insurance Contributions Act (“FICA”) tax tip credits.\nAs of October 1, 2024, we had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $1.1 million, of which approximately $1.0 million, if reversed, would impact our\neffective tax rate.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is the following (in thousands):\nFor the Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended\nOctober 1, 2024 October 3, 2023\nBeginning gross unrecognized tax benefits $ 967 $ 1,249\nIncreases for tax positions taken in prior years 29 102\nIncreases for tax positions taken in the current year 100 123\nDecreases due to lapse of statute of limitations — (236)\nEnding gross unrecognized tax benefits $ 1,096 $ 1,238\nOur uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that remain subject to examination by tax agencies. As of October 1, 2024, the earliest tax year still subject to\nexamination by the Internal Revenue Service is 2020, although 2015 is still open due to amendments related to a net operating loss carryback. The earliest year\nstill subject to examination by a significant state or local taxing authority is 2019.\n8. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe are subject to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and demands that arise in the ordinary course of our business and which typically involve claims from\nguests, team members and others related to operational, employment, real estate and intellectual property issues common to the foodservice industry. A number\nof these claims may exist at any given time. We are self-insured for a portion of our general liability, team member workers’ compensation and employment\npractice liability insurance requirements. We maintain coverage with a third-party insurer to limit our total exposure. We believe that most of our claims will be\ncovered by our insurance, subject to coverage limits and the portion of such claims that are self-insured; however, punitive damages awards are not covered by\nour insurance. To date, we have not been ordered to pay punitive damages with respect to any claims, but there can be no assurance that punitive damages will\nnot be awarded with respect to any future claims. We could be affected by adverse publicity resulting from allegations in lawsuits, claims and proceedings,\nregardless of whether these allegations are valid or whether we are\n10\nultimately determined to be liable. We currently believe that the final disposition of these types of lawsuits, proceedings and claims will not have a material\nadverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. It is possible, however, that our future results of operations for a particular quarter or\nfiscal year could be impacted by changes in circumstances relating to lawsuits, proceedings or claims.\n9. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nStock Repurchases\nDuring the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, we repurchased and retired approximately 523,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of\n$32.67 per share for approximately $17.1 million, which is recorded as a reduction in common stock, with any excess charged to retained earnings. In February\n2024, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our share repurchase program by $50 million. We currently have approximately $44.0 million available\nunder our authorized $550 million share repurchase program as of October 1, 2024. Repurchases may be made at any time.\nCash Dividends\nWe currently do not pay any cash dividends. Any payment of quarterly cash dividends will be subject to our Board of Directors determining that the payment of\ndividends is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.\n10. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nEquity Method Investment\nDuring fiscal 2022, we contributed assets valued at $5.0 million to a company, in which our Board member and former Chief Executive Officer has a less than\n1% interest. We recorded this non-cash contribution, in exchange for a 20% ownership of the company, as an investment within “Equity method investment” on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the related gain within “Loss on disposal and impairment of assets, net” on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFor the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024 and October 3, 2023, we recorded a net loss related to the investment of $0.4 million and $0.1 million,\nrespectively, within “Other income, net,” and accordingly adjusted the investment carrying amount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n11. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nEffective October 29, 2024, we entered into an Amendment No. 1 (Conforming Changes) to Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“the\nAmendment”) with Bank of America, N.A. (“BofA”), as the Administrative Agent pursuant to which the Company modified the Fourth Amended and Restated\nCredit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), dated November 3, 2021, with Bank of America, N.A. BofA, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and certain other\nparties. Pursuant to the Amendment, the referenced interest rate was changed from the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index rate (“BSBY”) (which will no\nlonger be reported effective in November 2024), to a term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”). The impact of this change is expected to be\nimmaterial on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 4 for further information.\nItem 2.

As of\nNovember 4, 2024, BJ's owns and operates 218 restaurants located in 31 states.\nThe first BJ’s restaurant opened in 1978 in Orange County, California, and was a small sit-down pizzeria that featured Chicago style deep-dish pizza with a\nunique California twist. In 1996, we introduced our proprietary craft beers and expanded the BJ’s concept to a full-service, high-energy casual dining restaurant\nwhen we opened our first large format restaurant with an on-site brewing operation in Brea, California. Today our restaurants feature a broad menu with\napproximately 100 menu items designed to offer something for everyone including: slow roasted entrees such as prime rib, EnLIGHTened Entrees® such as our\nCherry Chipotle Glazed Salmon, our original signature deep-dish pizza, and the world-famous Pizookie® dessert. We also offer our award-winning BJ’s craft\nbeers, which are produced at four in-house brewing facilities, two standalone brewpubs and by independent third-party brewers using our proprietary recipes,\nalongside a full bar featuring innovative cocktails.\nOur revenues are comprised of food and beverage sales from our restaurants, including takeout, delivery and catering sales. Revenues from restaurant sales are\nrecognized when payment is tendered. Amounts paid with a credit card are recorded in accounts and other receivables until payment is collected from the credit\ncard processor. We sell gift cards which do not have an expiration date, and we do not deduct non-usage fees from outstanding gift card balances. Gift card sales\nare recorded as a liability and recognized as revenues upon redemption in our restaurants. A portion of our gift card sales are not expected to be redeemed and\nwill be recognized as gift card “breakage.” Estimated gift card breakage is recorded as revenue and recognized in proportion to our historical redemption pattern,\nunless there is a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to government authorities.\nOur guest loyalty program enables participants to earn points for qualifying purchases that can be redeemed for food and beverages in the future. We allocate the\ntransaction price between the goods delivered and the future goods that will be delivered, on a relative standalone selling price basis, and defer the revenues\nallocated to the points until such points are redeemed.\nAll of our restaurants are Company-owned. In calculating comparable restaurant sales, we include a restaurant in the comparable base once it has been open for\n18 months. Guest traffic for our restaurants is estimated based on the number of guest checks.\nCost of sales is comprised of food and beverage costs, including the cost to produce and distribute our proprietary craft beer, soda and ciders. The components of\ncost of sales are variable and typically fluctuate directly with sales volumes but also may be impacted by changes in commodity prices, a shift in sales mix to\nhigher cost proteins or other higher cost items, or varying levels of promotional activities.\nLabor and benefit costs include direct hourly and management wages, bonuses, payroll taxes, fringe benefits and stock-based compensation, and workers’\ncompensation expense that are directly related to restaurant level team members.\nOccupancy and operating expenses include restaurant supplies, credit card fees, third-party delivery company commissions, marketing costs, fixed rent,\npercentage rent, common area maintenance charges, utilities, real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance and other related restaurant costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses include costs for our corporate administrative functions that support existing operations and provide infrastructure to\nfacilitate our future growth. Components of this category include corporate management, field supervision and corporate hourly staff salaries and related team\nmember benefits (including stock-based compensation expense and cash-based incentive compensation), travel and relocation costs, information systems, the\ncost to recruit and train new restaurant management team members, corporate rent, certain brand marketing-related expenses and legal and consulting fees.\nDepreciation and amortization are composed primarily of depreciation of capital expenditures for restaurant and brewing equipment and leasehold\nimprovements.\nRestaurant opening expenses, which are expensed as incurred, consist of the costs of hiring and training the initial hourly work force for each new restaurant,\ntravel, the cost of food and supplies used in training, grand opening promotional costs, the cost of the initial stock of operating supplies and other direct costs\nrelated to the opening of a restaurant, including rent during the construction and in-restaurant training period.\n12\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table provides, for the periods indicated, our unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations expressed as percentages of total revenues. The\nresults of operations for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024 and October 3, 2023, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be\nexpected for the full fiscal year. Percentages below may not reconcile due to rounding.\nFor the Thirteen Weeks Ended For the Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended\nOctober 1, 2024 October 3, 2023 October 1, 2024 October 3, 2023\nRevenues 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0%\nRestaurant operating costs (excluding depreciation\nand amortization):\nCost of sales 26.6 25.9 25.8 26.2\nLabor and benefits 37.1 37.1 36.7 37.0\nOccupancy and operating 24.7 25.1 23.4 23.9\nGeneral and administrative 6.4 6.1 6.4 6.0\nDepreciation and amortization 5.6 5.6 5.4 5.3\nRestaurant opening 0.3 0.4 0.2 0.3\nLoss on disposal and impairment of assets, net 0.1 0.4 0.3 0.5\nTotal costs and expenses 100.8 100.7 98.1 99.0\n(Loss) income from operations (0.8) (0.7) 1.9 1.0\nOther (expense) income:\nInterest expense, net (0.4) (0.3) (0.4) (0.3)\nOther income (expense), net 0.2 0.0 0.4 0.1\nTotal other (expense) income (0.2) (0.3) 0.0 (0.2)\n(Loss) income before income taxes (1.0) (1.1) 1.9 0.8\nIncome tax (benefit) expense (0.1) 0.1 (0.3) (0.4)\nNet (loss) income (0.9)% (1.2)% 2.2% 1.1%\nThirteen Weeks Ended October 1, 2024 Compared to Thirteen Weeks Ended October 3, 2023\nRevenues. Total revenues increased by $7.1 million, or 2.2%, to $325.7 million during the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024, from $318.6 million during the\ncomparable thirteen-week period of 2023. The increase in revenues primarily consisted of a 1.7%, or $5.2 million, increase in comparable restaurant sales, and\n$5.4 million related to sales from new restaurants not yet in our comparable restaurant sales base. This increase was offset by a $2.7 million decrease related to\nclosed restaurants and $0.7 million primarily related to gift card breakage and loyalty redemptions. The increase in comparable restaurant sales was due to an\nincrease in guest traffic of approximately 1.3%, coupled with an increase in average check of approximately 0.4%, resulting from menu price increases, changes\nin mix and a higher level of promotions.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales increased by $4.0 million, or 4.9%, to $86.7 million during the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024, from $82.7 million during the\ncomparable thirteen-week period of 2023. This was primarily due to higher commodity costs related to poultry and avocados. As a percentage of revenues, cost\nof sales increased to 26.6% for the current thirteen-week period from 25.9% for the prior year comparable period. This increase was primarily due to higher\ncommodity costs and a higher level of promotions, partially offset by menu price increases.\nLabor and Benefits. Labor and benefit costs for our restaurants increased by $2.5 million, or 2.1%, to $120.7 million during the thirteen weeks ended October 1,\n2024, from $118.2 million during the comparable thirteen-week period of 2023. This was primarily due to $1.5 million related to higher management\ncompensation, $0.9 million related to higher hourly labor, $0.8 million in taxes and benefits, and $0.1 million in higher stock-based compensation expense,\noffset by $0.9 million related to lower workers’ compensation costs. As a percentage of revenues, labor and benefit costs remained consistent at 37.1% for the\ncurrent thirteen-week period and the prior year comparable period. Included in labor and benefits for the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024 and October 3,\n2023, was approximately $0.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively, or 0.2%, of revenues of stock-based compensation expense, related to equity awards\ngranted in accordance with our Gold Standard Stock Ownership Program for certain restaurant management team members.\nOccupancy and Operating. Occupancy and operating expenses increased by $0.3 million, or 0.4%, to $80.3 million during the thirteen weeks ended October 1,\n2024, from $80.0 million during the comparable thirteen-week period of 2023. This was primarily due to increases of $1.2 million in marketing-related\nexpenses, offset by decreases of $0.9 million in restaurant facility expenses. As a percentage of revenues, occupancy and operating expenses decreased to 24.7%\nfor the current thirteen-week period from 25.1% for\n13\nthe prior year comparable period. This decrease was primarily related to improved operational efficiency and the effectiveness of our cost savings initiatives,\ncoupled with a higher revenue base.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased by $1.5 million, or 7.6%, to $21.0 million during the thirteen weeks ended October\n1, 2024, from $19.5 million during the comparable thirteen-week period of 2023. This was primarily due to increases of $1.7 million in personnel related costs,\n$0.8 million related to our deferred compensation liability, $0.4 million in legal fees, $0.3 million in office expenses, and $0.3 million in recruiting related\nexpenses, offset by lower stock-based compensation of $1.9 million, and incentive compensation of $0.4 million. General and administrative expenses during\nthe thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024 included a net charge of $1.7 million related to our leadership transition and severance, relocation and signing bonus\nexpenses, offset by a $2.1 million stock-based compensation credit related to the reversal of previously awarded stock-based compensation expense in\nconjunction with our leadership transition. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 6.4% for the current thirteen-week\nperiod from 6.1% for the prior year comparable period. This increase is primarily related to increased deferred compensation liability and personnel costs,\ncoupled with legal and recruiting fees, offset by lower stock-based compensation expense related to our leadership transition. Included in general and\nadministrative costs was stock-based compensation expense of approximately $0.2 million and $2.1 million, or 0.1% and 0.7% of revenues for the thirteen\nweeks ended October 1, 2024 and October 3, 2023, respectively.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased by $0.3 million, or 1.8%, to $18.2 million during the thirteen weeks ended October 1,\n2024, compared to $17.9 million during the comparable thirteen-week period of 2023. This increase was primarily related to depreciation expense related to our\nrestaurants opened since the thirteen weeks ended October 3, 2023, coupled with depreciation related to our remodeled restaurants, partially offset by the impact\nof impairment and disposal charges taken in the prior year, and the closure of two restaurants since the thirteen weeks ended October 3, 2023. As a percentage of\nrevenues, depreciation and amortization remained consistent at 5.6% for the current thirteen-week period and the prior year comparable period.\nRestaurant Opening. Restaurant opening expense decreased by $0.3 million, or 19.1%, to $1.1 million during the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024,\ncompared to $1.4 million during the comparable thirteen-week period of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the timing of openings.\nLoss on Disposal and Impairment of Assets, Net. Loss on disposal and impairment of assets, net, was $0.3 million during the thirteen weeks ended October 1,\n2024, and $1.4 million during the comparable thirteen-week period of 2023. For the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024, the costs primarily related to\ndisposals of assets in conjunction with initiatives to keep our restaurants up to date. For the thirteen weeks ended October 3, 2023, the costs primarily related to\ndisposals of assets in conjunction with initiatives to keep our restaurants up to date as well as the closure of an under-performing restaurant in the quarter.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, increased by $0.3 million to $1.3 million during the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024, compared to $1.0\nmillion during the comparable thirteen-week period of 2023. This increase was primarily due to the increase in weighted average interest rate year over year,\ncoupled with a higher average outstanding debt balance.\nOther Income, Net. Other income, net, increased to $0.8 million of income during the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024. This increase was primarily related\nto gains associated with the cash surrender value of certain life insurance policies under our deferred compensation plan.\nIncome Tax Benefit. Our effective income tax rate for the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024, was a benefit of 8.2% compared to an expense of 11.8% for the\ncomparable thirteen-week period of 2023. The effective tax rate for the thirteen weeks ended October 1, 2024 and October 3, 2023 was different than the\nstatutory rate primarily due to FICA tax tip credits.\nThirty-Nine Weeks Ended October 1, 2024 Compared to Thirty-Nine-Weeks Ended October 3, 2023\nRevenues. Total revenues increased by $3.4 million, or 0.3%, to $1.0 billion during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024. The increase in revenues\nprimarily consisted of an $18.5 million increase related to sales from new restaurants not yet in our comparable restaurant sales base, offset by a 0.2%, or $2.4\nmillion, decline in comparable restaurant sales, an $11.2 million decrease related to closed restaurants, and $1.5 million primarily related to gift card breakage\nand loyalty redemptions. The decrease in comparable restaurant sales was due to a decrease in guest traffic of approximately 2.5%, offset by an increase in\naverage check of approximately 2.3%, resulting from menu price increases and changes in mix.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales decreased by $2.7 million, or 1.0%, to $261.5 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, from $264.1 million\nduring the comparable thirty-nine-week period of 2023. This was primarily due to the effects of our cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher commodity\ncosts and a higher level of promotions. As a percentage of revenues, cost of sales decreased to 25.8% for the current thirty-nine-week period from 26.2% for the\nprior year comparable period. This decrease was primarily due to a higher revenue base, menu price increases and the effectiveness of our cost savings initiative,\npartially offset by higher commodity costs and a higher level of promotions.\n14\nLabor and Benefits. Labor and benefit costs for our restaurants decreased by $1.0 million, or 0.3%, to $372.0 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended\nOctober 1, 2024, from $373.1 million during the comparable thirty-nine-week period of 2023. This was primarily due to $2.3 million related to lower hourly\nlabor and $1.5 million related to lower workers’ compensation, offset by $2.1 million related to increased management compensation costs and $0.7 million\nrelated to taxes and benefits. As a percentage of revenues, labor and benefit costs decreased to 36.7% for the current thirty-nine-week period from 37.0% for the\nprior year comparable period.

Occupancy and operating expenses decreased by $4.3 million, or 1.8%, to $236.7 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended\nOctober 1, 2024, from $241.1 million during the comparable thirty-nine-week period of 2023. This was primarily due to decreases of $4.1 million in restaurant\nfacilities expenses, $1.0 million related to equipment rental, $0.9 million in utilities, and $0.3 million in delivery-related fees and expenses, offset by a $1.0\nmillion increase in credit card processing fees and $1.3 million in marketing expenditures. As a percentage of revenues, occupancy and operating expenses\ndecreased to 23.4% for the current thirty-nine-week period from 23.9% for the prior year comparable period.

As a\npercentage of revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 6.4% for the current thirty-nine-week period from 6.0% for the prior year comparable\nperiod. This increase was primarily related to increased legal and corporate expenses arising in connection with our previously announced cooperation\nagreements and related matters with certain investors. Included in general and administrative costs was stock-based compensation expense of approximately\n$4.4 million and $6.2 million, or 0.4% and 0.6% of revenues for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024 and October 3, 2023, respectively.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased by $1.0 million, or 1.9%, to $54.2 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended October\n1, 2024, compared to $53.2 million during the comparable thirty-nine-week period of 2023. This increase was primarily related to depreciation expense related\nto our restaurants opened since the thirty-nine weeks ended October 3, 2023, partially offset by the impact of impairment and disposal charges taken in the prior\nyear, and the closure of two restaurants since the thirty-nine weeks ended October 3, 2023. As a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization increased\nto 5.4% for the current thirty-nine-week period from 5.3% for the prior year comparable period. This increase was primarily due to increased depreciation\nexpense.\nRestaurant Opening. Restaurant opening expense decreased by $0.6 million, or 22.9%, to $2.0 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024,\ncompared to $2.6 million during the comparable thirty-nine-week period of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to the timing of openings.\nLoss on Disposal and Impairment of Assets, Net. Loss on disposal and impairment of assets, net, was $3.0 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1,\n2024, and $4.7 million during the comparable thirty-nine-week period of 2023. For the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, the cost primarily related to the\nimpairment and reduction in the carrying value of the long-lived assets related to one of our restaurants, coupled with the disposals of assets in conjunction with\ninitiatives to keep our restaurants up to date. For the thirty-nine weeks ended October 3, 2023, these costs primarily relate to disposals of assets in conjunction\nwith initiatives to keep our restaurants up to date, including our restaurant remodel initiative and the removal of glass partitions in our dining rooms that were\ninstalled during the pandemic, as well as the closure of four under-performing restaurants.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, increased by $0.8 million to $4.0 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, compared to $3.2\nmillion during the comparable thirty-nine-week period of 2023. This increase was primarily due to the increase in weighted average interest rate year over year,\ncoupled with a higher average outstanding debt balance.\nOther Income, Net. Other income, net, increased by $3.4 million to $4.2 million of income during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, compared to\n$0.8 million during the comparable thirty-nine-week period of 2023. This increase was primarily related to a payroll tax credit.\n15\nIncome Tax Benefit. Our effective income tax rate for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, was a benefit of 15.0% compared to a benefit of 44.9% for\nthe comparable thirty-nine-week period of 2023. The effective tax rate for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024 and October 3, 2023, was different than\nthe statutory rate primarily due to FICA tax tip credits.\nLIQUIDITY AND MATERIAL CASH REQUIREMENTS\nThe following table provides, for the periods indicated, a summary of our key liquidity measurements (dollars in thousands):\nOctober 1, 2024 January 2, 2024\nCash and cash equivalents $ 18,422 $ 29,070\nNet working capital $ (118,672) $ (116,304)\nCurrent ratio 0.4:1.0 0.4:1.0\nOur capital requirements are driven by our fundamental financial objective to improve total shareholder return through a balanced approach of new restaurant\nexpansion plans, enhancements and initiatives focused on existing restaurants and return of capital to our shareholders through our share repurchase program. In\naddition, we want to maintain a flexible balance sheet to provide the financial resources necessary to manage the risks and uncertainties of conducting our\nbusiness operations in the restaurant industry. In order to achieve these objectives, we use a combination of operating cash flows, debt, landlord allowances and\nproceeds from stock option exercises.\nBased on current operations, we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, coupled with cash generated from operations and availability under our credit\nagreement will be adequate to meet our capital expenditure and working capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Our future operating performance will\nbe subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nSimilar to many restaurant chains, we typically utilize operating lease arrangements (principally ground leases) for our restaurant locations. We believe our\noperating lease arrangements provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner. However, we are not limited to the use of\nlease arrangements as our only method of opening new restaurants and from time to time have purchased the underlying land for new restaurants. We typically\nlease our restaurant locations for periods of 10 to 20 years under operating lease arrangements. Our rent structures vary from lease to lease, but generally provide\nfor the payment of both minimum and contingent (percentage) rent based on sales, as well as other expenses related to the leases (for example, our pro-rata share\nof common area maintenance, property tax and insurance expenses). Many of our lease arrangements include the opportunity to secure tenant improvement\nallowances to partially offset the cost of developing and opening the related restaurants. Generally, landlords recover the cost of such allowances from increased\nminimum rents. There can be no assurance that such allowances will be available to us on each project. From time to time, we may also decide to purchase the\nunderlying land for a new restaurant if that is the only way to secure a highly desirable site. Currently, we own the underlying land for our Texas brewpub\nlocations. We also own parcels of land adjacent to two of our restaurants. It is not our current strategy to own a large number of land parcels that underlie our\nrestaurants. Therefore, in many cases we have subsequently entered into sale-leaseback arrangements for land parcels that we previously purchased. We disburse\ncash for certain site-related work, buildings, leasehold improvements, furnishings, fixtures and equipment to build our leased and owned premises. We own\nsubstantially all of the equipment, furniture and trade fixtures in our restaurants and currently plan to do so in the future.\nCASH FLOWS\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities (in thousands):\nFor the Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended\nOctober 1, 2024 October 3, 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 69,842 $ 73,611\nNet cash used in investing activities (61,028) (81,964)\nNet cash used in financing activities (19,462) (4,555)\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (10,648) $ (12,908)\nOperating Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $69.8 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, representing a $3.8 million decrease from the\n$73.6 million provided during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 3, 2023. The decrease over prior year is\n16\nprimarily due to the timing of accounts receivable receipts coupled with the timing of accounts payable and accrued expense payments, offset by improved net\nincome.\nInvesting Cash Flows\nNet cash used in investing activities was $61.0 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, representing a $20.9 million decrease from the $82.0\nmillion used during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 3, 2023. The decrease over prior year is primarily due to the number of new restaurant openings\ncoupled with the timing of restaurant remodel activity.\nThe following table provides, for the periods indicated, the components of capital expenditures (in thousands):\nFor the Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended\nOctober 1, 2024 October 3, 2023\nNew restaurants $ 22,889 $ 34,382\nRestaurant maintenance and remodels, and key productivity initiatives 37,335 46,956\nRestaurant and corporate systems 804 630\nTotal capital expenditures $ 61,028 $ 81,968\nAs of November 4, 2024, we have opened three new restaurants and closed one restaurant this year. We currently anticipate our total capital expenditures for\nfiscal 2024 to be approximately $75 million. This estimate includes costs to open new restaurants and remodel existing locations and excludes anticipated\nproceeds from tenant improvement allowances. We expect to fund our net capital expenditures with our current cash balance on hand, cash flows from\noperations and our line of credit. Our future cash requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace of our expansion, conditions in the retail\nproperty development market, construction costs, the nature of the specific sites selected for new restaurants, and the nature of the specific leases and associated\ntenant improvement allowances available, if any, as negotiated with landlords.\nFinancing Cash Flows\nNet cash used in financing activities was $19.5 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, representing a $14.9 million increase from the $4.6\nmillion used during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 3, 2023. The increase over prior year is primarily due to an increase in shares repurchased.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as\nstructured finance or variable interest entities (“VIEs”), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or\nother contractually narrow limited purposes. As of October 1, 2024, we are not involved in any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION\nInflation has had an impact on our operations, new restaurant construction and corresponding return on invested capital. While we have been able to partially\noffset inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating inputs by gradually increasing menu prices, coupled with cost savings initiatives, more efficient\npurchasing practices, productivity improvements and greater economies of scale, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future.\nIncreases in inflation could have a severe impact on the United States and global economies, which will have an adverse impact on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. In addition, macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer discretionary spending for food away from home could make\nadditional menu price increases imprudent. Whether we are able to continue to offset the effects of inflation through menu price increases or cost savings will\ndetermine to what extent, if any, inflation affects our restaurant profitability in future periods.\nSEASONALITY AND ADVERSE WEATHER\nOur business is impacted by weather and other seasonal factors that typically impact other restaurant operations. Holidays (and shifts in the holiday calendar)\nand severe weather including hurricanes, tornados, thunderstorms, snow and ice storms, prolonged extreme temperatures and similar conditions may impact\nrestaurant sales volumes in some of the markets where we operate. Many of our restaurants are located in or near shopping centers and malls that typically\nexperience seasonal fluctuations in sales. Quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings\nand their associated restaurant opening expenses. As a result of these and other factors, our financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the\nresults that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.\n17\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets\nand liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses in the reporting period. We base our estimates and\nassumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form\nthe basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other\nsources. We continually review the estimates and underlying assumptions to ensure they are appropriate for the circumstances. Accounting assumptions and\nestimates are inherently uncertain and actual results may differ materially from our estimates.\nA summary of our other critical accounting policies is included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\ncontained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2024. During the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, there were no\nsignificant changes in our critical accounting policies.\nItem 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe following discussion of market risks contains “forward-looking” statements. Actual results may differ materially from the following discussion based on\ngeneral conditions in the financial and commodity markets.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe have a $215 million Credit Facility, of which $66.5 million is currently outstanding and carries interest at a floating rate. We utilize the Credit Facility\nprincipally for letters of credit that are required to support our self-insurance programs, to fund a portion of our announced share repurchase program, and for\nworking capital and construction requirements, as needed. We are exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations in interest rates on our obligations under the\nCredit Facility. Based on our current outstanding balance, a hypothetical 1% change in the interest rates under our Credit Facility would have an approximate\n$0.5 million annual impact on our net income.\nFood, Supplies and Commodity Price Risks\nWe purchase food, supplies and other commodities for use in our operations based upon market prices established with our suppliers. Our business is dependent\non frequent and consistent deliveries of these items. We may experience shortages, delays or interruptions due to inclement weather, natural disasters, labor\nissues or other operational disruptions or other conditions beyond our control such as cyber breaches or ransomware attacks at our suppliers, distributors or\ntransportation providers. Additionally, many of the commodities purchased by us can be subject to volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of\nour control, whether contracted for or not. Costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation. To manage this risk in part, we attempt to enter into fixed-price\npurchase commitments, with terms typically up to one year, for some of our commodity requirements. However, it may not be possible for us to enter into fixed-\nprice contracts for certain commodities or we may choose not to enter into fixed-price contracts for certain commodities. We believe that substantially all of our\nfood and supplies are available from several sources, which helps to diversify our overall commodity cost risk. We also believe that we have some flexibility and\nability to increase certain menu prices, or vary certain menu items offered or promoted, in response to food commodity price increases. Some of our commodity\npurchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing certain price floors or caps. We do not use financial instruments\nto hedge commodity prices, since our purchase arrangements with suppliers, to the extent that we can enter into such arrangements, help control the ultimate cost\nthat we pay.\nItem 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as\namended, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as\nof October 1, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to\ndisclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the\nSEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)\nduring our third fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 5. OTHER INFORMATION\n18\nNone.\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nSee Note 8 of Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report for a summary of legal proceedings.\nItem 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThere have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 2, 2024.\nItem 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nAs of October 1, 2024, we have cumulatively repurchased shares valued at approximately $506.0 million in accordance with our approved share repurchase plan\nsince its inception in 2014. During the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024, we repurchased and retired shares valued at approximately $17.1 million. Share\nrepurchases were executed through open market purchases, and future share repurchases may be completed through a combination of individually negotiated\ntransactions, accelerated share buyback, and/or open market purchases. In February 2024, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our share repurchase\nprogram by $50 million. As a result, we had approximately $44.0 million available under our authorized $550 million share repurchase program as of October 1,\n2024.\nThe following table sets forth information with respect to the repurchase of common shares during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 1, 2024:\nTotal\nNumber of Dollar Value\nShares of Shares that\nPurchased as Increase in May Yet Be\nTotal Average Part of the Dollars for Purchased\nNumber Price Publicly Share Under the\nof Shares Paid Per Announced Repurchase Plans or\nPeriod (1) Purchased Share Plans Authorization Programs\n01/03/24 - 01/30/24 — $ — — $ — $ 11,055,206\n01/31/24 - 02/27/24 — $ — — $ 50,000,000 $ 61,055,206\n02/28/24 - 04/02/24 — $ — — $ — $ 61,055,206\n04/03/24 - 04/30/24 — $ — — $ — $ 61,055,206\n05/01/24 - 05/28/24 86,960 $ 34.54 86,960 $ — $ 58,051,544\n05/29/24 - 07/02/24 167,665 $ 34.78 167,665 $ — $ 52,220,358\n07/03/24 - 07/30/24 — $ — — $ — $ 52,220,358\n07/31/24 - 08/27/24 — $ — — $ — $ 52,220,358\n08/28/24 - 10/01/24 268,312 $ 30.74 268,312 $ — $ 43,971,572\nTotal 522,937 522,937\n(1) Period information is presented in accordance with our fiscal months during fiscal 2024.\n19\nItem 6.

THE COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS\n2.01Committed Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender severally agrees to make loans (each such\nloan, a “Committed Loan”) to the Borrower from time to time, on any Business Day during the Availability Period, in an aggregate amount not to\nexceed at any time outstanding the amount of such Lender’s Commitment; provided, however, that after giving effect to any Committed\nBorrowing, (i) the Total Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate Commitments, and (ii) the Revolving Credit Exposure of any Lender shall\nnot exceed such Lender’s Commitment. Within the limits of each Lender’s Commitment, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the\nBorrower\n27\n151056736_7\nmay borrow under this Section 2.01, prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.01. Committed Loans may be Base Rate\nLoans or Term SOFR Loans, as further provided herein.\n2.02Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Committed Loans.\n(a)Each Committed Borrowing, each conversion of Committed Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Term SOFR\nLoans shall be made upon the Borrower’s irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by (A) telephone, or (B) a\nCommitted Loan Notice; provided that any telephonic notice must be confirmed immediately by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a\nCommitted Loan Notice. Each such Committed Loan Notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m. (i) two\nBusiness Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans or of any conversion of Term\nSOFR Loans to Base Rate Loans, and (ii) on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or\ncontinuation of Term SOFR Loans shall be in a principal amount of $100,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Except as\nprovided in Section 2.03(c), each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $100,000 or a whole multiple\nof $100,000 in excess thereof. Each Committed Loan Notice shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is requesting a Committed Borrowing, a\nconversion of Committed Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Term SOFR Loans, (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing,\nconversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Committed Loans to be borrowed,\nconverted or continued, (iv) the Type of Committed Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Committed Loans are to be converted, and (v) if\napplicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Committed Loan in a Committed\nLoan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Committed Loans shall be\nmade as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest\nPeriod then in effect with respect to the applicable Term SOFR Loans. If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of\nTerm SOFR Loans in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest\nPeriod of one month.\n(b)Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its\nApplicable Percentage of the applicable Committed Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower,\nthe Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans described in the preceding\nsubsection. In the case of a Committed Borrowing, each Lender shall make the amount of its Committed Loan available to the Administrative\nAgent in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agent’s Office not later than 12:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the\napplicable Committed Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (and, if such Borrowing is the initial\nCredit Extension, Section 4.01), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by\nthe Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of Bank of America with the amount of such funds or\n(ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent\nby the Borrower; provided, however, that if, on the date the Committed Loan Notice with respect to such Borrowing is given by the Borrower,\nthere are L/C Borrowings outstanding, then the proceeds of such Borrowing, first, shall be applied to the payment in full of any such L/C\nBorrowings, and second, shall be made available to the Borrower as provided above.\n(c)Except as otherwise provided herein, a Term SOFR Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period\nfor such Term SOFR Loan. During the existence of a Default, no Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Term SOFR Loans\nwithout the consent of the Required Lenders.\n28\n151056736_7\n(d)The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period\nfor Term SOFR Loans upon determination of such interest rate. At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall\nnotify the Borrower and the Lenders of any change in Bank of America’s prime rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following the\npublic announcement of such change.\n(e)After giving effect to all Committed Borrowings, all conversions of Committed Loans from one Type to the other, and all\ncontinuations of Committed Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than 10 Interest Periods in effect with respect to Committed Loans.\n(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Lender may exchange, continue or rollover all of the portion of its\nLoans in connection with any refinancing, extension, loan modification or similar transaction permitted by the terms of this Agreement, pursuant\nto a cashless settlement mechanism approved by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, and such Lender.\n(g)With respect to SOFR or Term SOFR, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time\nand, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes\nwill become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that, with\nrespect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to\nthe Borrower and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective.\n2.03Letters of Credit.\n(a)The Letter of Credit Commitment.\n(i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (A) each L/C Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the\nLenders set forth in this Section 2.03, (1) from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until the\nLetter of Credit Expiration Date, to issue Letters of Credit for the account of the Borrower, and to amend or extend Letters of Credit\npreviously issued by it, in accordance with subsection (b) below, and (2) to honor drawings under the Letters of Credit; and (B) the\nLenders severally agree to participate in Letters of Credit issued for the account of the Borrower and any drawings thereunder; provided\nthat after giving effect to any L/C Credit Extension with respect to any Letter of Credit, (x) the Total Outstandings shall not exceed the\nAggregate Commitments, (y) the Revolving Credit Exposure of any Lender shall not exceed such Lender’s Commitment, and (z) the\nOutstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit; provided, further, that after giving effect to\nall L/C Credit Extensions, the aggregate Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations of any L/C Issuer shall not exceed such L/C\nIssuer’s L/C Commitment. Each request by the Borrower for the issuance or amendment of a Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be a\nrepresentation by the Borrower that the L/C Credit Extension so requested complies with the conditions set forth in the proviso to the\npreceding sentence. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower’s ability to obtain Letters\nof Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the Borrower may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace\nLetters of Credit that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed. All Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to have\nbeen issued pursuant hereto by such L/C Issuer that issued them, and from and after the Closing Date shall be subject to and governed\nby the terms and conditions hereof.\n(ii) No L/C Issuer shall issue any Letter of Credit, if:\n29\n151056736_7\n(A)subject to Section 2.03(b)(iii), the expiry date of the requested Letter of Credit would occur more than twelve\nmonths after the date of issuance or last extension, unless the Required Lenders have approved such expiry date; or\n(B)the expiry date of the requested Letter of Credit would occur after the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, unless all\nthe Lenders have approved such expiry date.\n(iii) No L/C Issuer shall be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if:\n(A)any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or\nrestrain such L/C Issuer from issuing the Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to such L/C Issuer or any request or directive\n(whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such L/C Issuer shall\nprohibit, or request that such L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or the Letter of Credit in\nparticular or shall impose upon such L/C Issuer with respect to the Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital\nrequirement (for which such L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall\nimpose upon such L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which\nsuch L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it;\n(B)the issuance of the Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of such L/C Issuer applicable to letters of\ncredit generally;\n(C)except as otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and such L/C Issuer, the Letter of Credit is in an initial\nstated amount less than $75,000.00;\n(D)the Letter of Credit is to be denominated in a currency other than Dollars;\n(E)any Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless such L/C Issuer has entered into arrangements, including\nthe delivery of Cash Collateral, satisfactory to such L/C Issuer (in its sole discretion) with the Borrower or such Lender to\neliminate such L/C Issuer’s actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.16(a)(iv)) with respect to the\nDefaulting Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or that Letter of Credit and all other L/C\nObligations as to which such L/C Issuer has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion; or\n(F) the Letter of Credit contains any provisions for automatic reinstatement of the stated amount after any drawing\nthereunder.\n(iv) No L/C Issuer shall amend any Letter of Credit if such L/C Issuer would not be permitted at such time to issue the\nLetter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof.\n(v) No L/C Issuer shall be under any obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) such L/C Issuer would have no\nobligation at such time to issue the Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of the Letter of\nCredit does not accept the proposed amendment to the Letter of Credit.\n(vi) Each L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents\nassociated therewith, and each L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to the Administrative Agent in\nArticle IX with respect to\n30\n151056736_7\nany acts taken or omissions suffered by such L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it\nand Issuer Documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term “Administrative Agent” as used in Article IX included\nsuch L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (B) as additionally provided herein with respect to such L/C Issuer.\n(b)Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Extension Letters of Credit.\n(i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Borrower delivered to an\nL/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed\nby a Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Such Letter of Credit Application may be sent by facsimile, by United States mail, by\novernight courier, by electronic transmission using the system provided by such L/C Issuer, by personal delivery or by any other means\nacceptable to such L/C Issuer. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by such L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not\nlater than 11:00 a.m. at least two Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative Agent and such L/C Issuer may agree\nin a particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case\nof a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to\nsuch L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount\nthereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such\nbeneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any\ndrawing thereunder; (G) the purpose and nature of the requested Letter of Credit; and (H) such other matters as such L/C Issuer may\nrequire. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in\nform and detail satisfactory to such L/C Issuer (A) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the proposed date of amendment thereof\n(which shall be a Business Day); (C) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (D) such other matters as such L/C Issuer may require.\nAdditionally, the Borrower shall furnish to such L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent such other documents and information\npertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as such L/C Issuer or the\nAdministrative Agent may require.\n(ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the applicable L/C Issuer will confirm with the\nAdministrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit Application\nfrom the Borrower and, if not, such L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Unless such L/C Issuer has\nreceived written notice from any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, at least one Business Day prior to the requested\ndate of issuance or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in Article IV shall not\nthen be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, such L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit\nfor the account of the Borrower or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with such L/C\nIssuer’s usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed\nto, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from such L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in\nan amount equal to the product of such Lender’s Applicable Percentage times the amount of such Letter of Credit.\n(iii) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the applicable L/C Issuer may, in its sole\ndiscretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic\n31\n151056736_7\nextension provisions (each, an “Auto-Extension Letter of Credit”); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit\nsuch L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such\nLetter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the “Non-Extension Notice Date”) in each such\ntwelve‑month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by such L/C Issuer, the\nBorrower shall not be required to make a specific request to such L/C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of\nCredit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) such L/C Issuer to permit the extension of\nsuch Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided, however, that such L/C\nIssuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) such L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no\nobligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the\nprovisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of Section 2.03(a) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing)\non or before the day that is seven Business Days before the Non‑Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the\nRequired Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Borrower that one\nor more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing such L/C Issuer not to\npermit such extension.\n(iv) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the applicable L/C Issuer may, in its sole\ndiscretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that permits the automatic reinstatement of all or a portion of the stated amount thereof after\nany drawing thereunder (each, an “Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit”). Unless otherwise directed by such L/C Issuer, the Borrower\nshall not be required to make a specific request to such L/C Issuer to permit such reinstatement. Once an Auto-Reinstatement Letter of\nCredit has been issued, except as provided in the following sentence, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not\nrequire) such L/C Issuer to reinstate all or a portion of the stated amount thereof in accordance with the provisions of such Letter of\nCredit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit permits such L/C Issuer to decline to reinstate all or\nany portion of the stated amount thereof after a drawing thereunder by giving notice of such non-reinstatement within a specified\nnumber of days after such drawing (the “Non-Reinstatement Deadline”), such L/C Issuer shall not permit such reinstatement if it has\nreceived a notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven Business Days before the Non-\nReinstatement Deadline (A) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such reinstatement or\n(B) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is\nnot then satisfied (treating such reinstatement as an L/C Credit Extension for purposes of this clause) and, in each case, directing such\nL/C Issuer not to permit such reinstatement.\n(v) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with\nrespect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the applicable L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a\ntrue and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.\n(c)Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.\n(i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the\naffected L/C Issuer shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of any\npayment by the affected L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an “Honor Date”), the Borrower shall reimburse such L/C\n32\n151056736_7\nIssuer directly (in accordance with the terms of such L/C Issuer’s Letter of Credit documentation) in an amount equal to the amount of\nsuch drawing. If the Borrower fails to so reimburse such L/C Issuer by such time, such L/C Issuer shall promptly notify the\nAdministrative Agent of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the “Unreimbursed Amount”), and the\nAdministrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date, Unreimbursed Amount, and the amount of such Lender’s\nApplicable Percentage thereof.\nIn such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in\nan amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of\nBase Rate Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02\n(other than the delivery of a Committed Loan Notice). Any notice given by an L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section\n2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not\naffect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.\n(ii) Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available (and the Administrative Agent\nmay apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose) for the account of the affected L/C Issuer at the Administrative Agent’s Office in\nan amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later than 10:00 a.m. on the Business Day specified in\nsuch notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each Lender that so makes funds\navailable shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the\nfunds so received to the affected L/C Issuer.\n(iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans\nbecause the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have\nincurred from the affected L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which\nL/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event,\neach Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the affected L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be\ndeemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in\nsatisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03.\n(iv) Until each Lender funds its Committed Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the affected\nL/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of such amount\nshall be solely for the account of the affected L/C Issuer.\n(v) Each Lender’s obligation to make Committed Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse an L/C Issuer for amounts drawn\nunder Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any\ncircumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against such L/C\nIssuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) as to L/C Advances, the occurrence or continuance of a Default,\nor (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Lender’s\nobligation to make Committed Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than\ndelivery by the Borrower of a Committed Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the\nobligation of the Borrower to\n33\n151056736_7\nreimburse an L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by such L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as\nprovided herein.\n(vi) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of an L/C Issuer any amount required\nto be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii), then,\nwithout limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, such L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through\nthe Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the\ndate on which such payment is immediately available to such L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds\nRate and a rate determined by such L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any\nadministrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by such L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays\nsuch amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Committed Loan included in the\nrelevant Committed Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of an L/C\nIssuer submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (vi) shall be\nconclusive absent manifest error.\n(d)Repayment of Participations.\n(i) At any time after an L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such\nLender’s L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the\naccount of such L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the\nBorrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent\nwill distribute to such Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.\n(ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of an L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is\nrequired to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by\nsuch L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such L/C Issuer its Applicable\nPercentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount\nis returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the\nLenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.\n(e)Obligations Absolute.

The Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against such L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless\nsuch notice is given as aforesaid.\n(f) Role of L/C Issuer. Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the applicable L/C\nIssuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the\nLetter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or\ndelivering any such document. None of any L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent,\nparticipant or assignee of any L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or\nwith the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or\nwillful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of\nCredit or Issuer Document. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use\nof any Letter of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower’s pursuing such rights and\nremedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement.

In furtherance and not\nin limitation of the foregoing, an L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further\ninvestigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and such L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of\nany instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds\nthereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. An L/C Issuer may send a Letter of Credit or conduct\nany communication to or from the beneficiary via the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (“SWIFT”) message or\novernight courier, or any other commercially reasonable means of communicating with a beneficiary.\n(g)Applicability of ISP; Limitation of Liability. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the applicable L/C Issuer and the Borrower when\na Letter of Credit is issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), the rules of the ISP shall apply to each\nstandby Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an L/C Issuer shall not be responsible to the Borrower for, and such L/C Issuer’s rights\nand remedies against the Borrower shall not be impaired by, any action or inaction of such L/C Issuer required or permitted under any law, order,\nor practice that is required or permitted to be applied to any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, including the Law or any order of a jurisdiction\nwhere such L/C Issuer or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP or in the decisions, opinions, practice statements, or official\ncommentary of the ICC Banking Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade - International Financial Services Association\n(BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of International Banking Law & Practice, whether or not any Letter of Credit chooses such law or practice.\n(h)Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance, subject to\nSection 2.16, with its Applicable Percentage a Letter of Credit fee (the “Letter of Credit Fee”) for each Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable\nRate times the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn\nunder any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.06. Letter of Credit Fees shall be\n(i) due and payable on the first Business Day after the end of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to\noccur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand and (ii) computed on a\nquarterly basis in arrears. If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under each\nLetter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate\nwas in effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of Default\nexists, all Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default Rate.\n(i) Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall pay directly to each L/C Issuer for its own account\nthe customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of such L/C Issuer relating to\nletters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are\nnonrefundable. Any such customary fees and standard costs and charges not paid by the Borrower shall be reimbursed by the Lenders in an\namount equal to its Applicable Percentage of such customary fees and standard costs and charges.\n36\n151056736_7\n(j) Conflict with Issuer Documents. In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the\nterms hereof shall control.\n(k)L/C Issuer Reports to the Administrative Agent.

If a Person serving as an L/C Issuer is a Defaulting Lender, the Required Lenders may, to the extent\npermitted by Applicable Law, by notice in writing to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the other L/C Issuers and such Person remove such\nPerson as an L/C Issuer, and the Borrower (with the prior consent of the Administrative Agent) may replace such L/C Issuer with any Lender who\nis not a Defaulting Lender (provided that no Lender shall be required to become an L/C Issuer pursuant to this Paragraph without such Lender’s\nconsent). If no such successor shall have been so selected and shall have accepted such selections within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be\nagreed by the Required Lenders) (the “L/C Issuer Removal Effective Date”), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance\nwith such notice on the L/C Issuer Removal Effective Date.\n(m)Replacement of Any L/C Issuer. Any L/C Issuer may be replaced at any time by written agreement between the Borrower, the\nAdministrative Agent, the replaced L/C Issuer and the successor L/C Issuer. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such\nreplacement of an L/C Issuer. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the\naccount of the replaced L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(h). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor L/C\nIssuer shall have all the rights and obligations of an L/C Issuer under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued by it thereafter\nand (ii) references herein to the term “L/C Issuer” shall be deemed to include such successor or any previous L/C Issuer, or such successor and all\nprevious L/C Issuer, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an L/C Issuer hereunder, the replaced L/C Issuer shall remain a party\nhereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an L/C Issuer under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it\nprior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.\n2.04Intentionally Omitted.\n37\n151056736_7\n2.05Prepayments.\n(a)The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Notice of Loan\nPrepayment, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Committed Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that,\nunless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, (i) such notice must be in a form acceptable to the Administrative Agent and be received by\nthe Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m. (A) two Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Term SOFR Loans and (B) on the\ndate of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (ii) any prepayment of Term SOFR Loans shall be in a principal amount of $100,000 or a whole multiple\nof $100,000 in excess thereof; and (iii) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $100,000 or a whole multiple of\n$100,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding.

The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such\nLender’s Applicable Percentage of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the\npayment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of any Loan shall be\naccompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with, in the case of any Term SOFR Loan, any additional amounts required\npursuant to Section 3.05. Subject to Section 2.16, each such prepayment shall be applied to the Committed Loans of the Lenders in accordance\nwith their respective Applicable Percentages.\n(b)If for any reason the Total Outstandings at any time exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect, the Borrower shall\nimmediately prepay Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to such excess; provided, however, that\nthe Borrower shall not be required to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.05(B) unless after the prepayment in full of\nthe Committed Loans the Total Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect.\n2.06Termination or Reduction of Commitments.\n(a)The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Commitments, or from time to time\npermanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than\n10:00 a.m. five Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of\n$1,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (iii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Aggregate Commitments if,\nafter giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Outstandings would exceed the Aggregate Commitments, and\n(iv) if, after giving effect to any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments, the Letter of Credit Sublimit exceeds the amount of the Aggregate\nCommitments, the Letter of Credit Sublimit shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess.\n(b)The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate\nCommitments. Any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments shall be applied to the Commitment of each Lender according to its Applicable\nPercentage.

In addition to certain fees described in subsections (h) and (i) of Section 2.03:\n(a)Unused Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its\nApplicable Percentage, an unused commitment fee equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual daily amount by which (a) the Aggregate\nCommitments exceeds (b) the sum of (i) the Outstanding Amount of Committed Loans and (ii) the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations,\nsubject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.16. The unused commitment fee shall accrue at all times during the Availability Period, including\nat any time during which one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last\nBusiness Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the last\nday of the Availability Period. The commitment fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate\nduring any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such\nquarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.\n39\n151056736_7\n(b)Other Fees. (i) The Borrower shall pay to the Arranger and the Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the\namounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason\nwhatsoever.\n(ii) The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts\nand at the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.\n2.10Computation of Interest and Fees; Retroactive Adjustments of Applicable Rate.\n(a)All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to the Term SOFR) shall be\nmade on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be\nmade on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on\nthe basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any\nportion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made\nshall, subject to Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder\nshall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.\n(b)If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of the Borrower or for any other reason, the\nBorrower or the Lenders determine that (i) the Pricing Total Lease Adjusted Leverage Ratio (as defined in the definition of “Applicable Rate”) as\ncalculated by the Borrower as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Pricing Total Lease Adjusted Leverage\nRatio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the\nAdministrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuers, as the case may be, promptly on demand by the\nAdministrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under the\nBankruptcy Code of the United States, automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer), an\namount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees\nactually paid for such period. This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer, as the case may\nbe, under Section 2.03(c)(iii), 2.03(h) or 2.08(b) or under Article VIII. The Borrower’s obligations under this paragraph shall survive the\ntermination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment of all other Obligations hereunder.\n2.11Evidence of Debt.\n(a)The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender in\nthe ordinary course of business. The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register in accordance with Section 10.06(c). The accounts or\nrecords maintained by each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the\nBorrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the\nobligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts\nand records maintained by any Lender and the Register, the Register shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any\nLender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note,\nwhich shall evidence such Lender’s Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse\nthereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.\n40\n151056736_7\n(b)In addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (a) above, each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain\nin accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit.\nIn the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender\nin respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.\n2.12Payments Generally; Administrative Agent’s Clawback.\n(a)General. All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made free and clear of and without condition or deduction for any\ncounterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be\nmade to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent’s Office\nin Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly\ndistribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by\nwire transfer to such Lender’s Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 11:00 a.m. shall be deemed received on\nthe next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall\ncome due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be\nreflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.\n(b)(i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from\na Lender prior to the proposed date of any Committed Borrowing of Term SOFR Loans (or, in the case of any Committed Borrowing of Base Rate\nLoans, prior to 11:00 a.m. on the date of such Committed Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such\nLender’s share of such Committed Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date\nin accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in\naccordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a\ncorresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Committed Borrowing available to the\nAdministrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such\ncorresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made\navailable to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such\nLender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on\ninterbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with\nthe foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and\nsuch Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly\nremit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable\nCommitted Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Committed Loan included in such\nCommitted Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall\nhave failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.\n(ii) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received\nnotice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or\nthe L/C Issuers hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume\n41\n151056736_7\nthat the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to\nthe Lenders or the L/C Issuers, as the case may be, the amount due.\nWith respect to any payment that the Administrative Agent makes for the account of the Lenders or an L/C Issuer hereunder as\nto which the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that any of the following\napplies (such payment referred to as the “Rescindable Amount”): (1) the Borrower has not in fact made such payment; (2) the\nAdministrative Agent has made a payment in excess of the amount so paid by the Borrower (whether or not then owed); or (3) the\nAdministrative Agent has for any reason otherwise erroneously made such payment; then each of the Lenders or the applicable L/C\nIssuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the Rescindable Amount so\ndistributed to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the\ndate such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds\nRate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.\nA notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be\nconclusive, absent manifest error.\n(c)Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made\nby such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the\nAdministrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance\nwith the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without\ninterest.\n(d)Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Committed Loans, to fund participations in\nLetters of Credit and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Committed\nLoan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other\nLender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its\nCommitted Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c).\n(e)Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or\nmanner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.\n2.13Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain\npayment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Committed Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations held by it\nresulting in such Lender’s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Committed Loans or participations and accrued\ninterest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the\nAdministrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Committed Loans and subparticipations in L/C\nObligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by\nthe Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Committed Loans and other\namounts owing them, provided that:\n42\n151056736_7\n(i) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is\nrecovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery,\nwithout interest; and\n(ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of the Borrower\npursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of\na Defaulting Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in Section 2.15, or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as\nconsideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Committed Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations to\nany assignee or participant, other than an assignment to the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section\nshall apply).\nThe Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under Applicable Law, that any Lender\nacquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect\nto such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.\n2.14Increase in Commitments.\n(a)Request for Increase. Provided there exists no Default, upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the\nLenders), the Borrower may from time to time after the Closing Date request an increase in the Aggregate Commitments by an amount (for all\nsuch requests) not exceeding $100,000,000.00 (an “Incremental Facility”); provided that (i) any such request for an Incremental Facility shall be\nin a minimum amount of $25,000,000, and (ii) the Borrower may make a maximum of three such requests.

If (i) any L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and\nsuch drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, (ii) as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains\noutstanding, (iii) the Borrower shall be required to provide Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 8.02(c), or (iv) there shall exist a Defaulting\nLender, the Borrower shall immediately (in the case of clause (iii) above) or within one Business Day (in all other cases) following any request by\nthe Administrative Agent or the affected L/C Issuer, provide Cash Collateral in an amount not less than the applicable Minimum Collateral\nAmount (determined in the case of Cash Collateral provided pursuant to clause (iv) above, after giving effect to Section 2.16(a)(iv) and any Cash\nCollateral provided by the Defaulting Lender). If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that any funds held as Cash Collateral are\nsubject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent or that the total amount of such funds is less than the aggregate\nOutstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, the Borrower will, forthwith upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay to the Administrative\nAgent, as additional funds to be deposited as Cash Collateral, an amount equal to the excess of (x) such aggregate Outstanding Amount over (y)\nthe total amount of funds, if any, then held as Cash Collateral that the Administrative Agent determines to be free and clear of any such right and\nclaim. Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit as Cash Collateral, such funds shall be applied, to the extent\npermitted under Applicable Laws, to reimburse the L/C Issuers. Additionally, if the\n44\n151056736_7\nAdministrative Agent notifies the Borrower at any time that the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations at such time exceeds 105% of the\nLetter of Credit Sublimit then in effect, then, within two Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall provide Cash Collateral for\nthe Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations in an amount not less than the amount by which the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations\nexceeds the Letter of Credit Sublimit.\n(b)Grant of Security Interest.

If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of\nany Person other than the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuers as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than\nthe Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative\nAgent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency. All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not\nconstituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, non‑interest bearing deposit accounts at Bank of America. The Borrower\nshall pay on demand therefor from time to time all customary account opening, activity and other administrative fees and charges in connection\nwith the maintenance and disbursement of Cash Collateral.\n(c)Application.

Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or to secure other obligations\nshall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto (including by\nthe termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate, its assignee following compliance with Section 10.06(b)\n(vi))) or (ii) the determination by the Administrative Agent and the affected L/C Issuers that there exists excess Cash Collateral; provided,\nhowever, (x) any such release shall be without prejudice to, and any disbursement or other transfer of Cash Collateral shall be and remain subject\nto, any other Lien conferred under the Loan Documents and the other applicable provisions of the Loan Documents, and (y) the Person providing\nCash Collateral and the affected L/C Issuers may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated\nFronting Exposure or other obligations.\n2.16Defaulting Lenders.\n(a)Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender,\nthen, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law:\n(i) Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or\nconsent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of “Required Lenders” and Section 10.01.\n45\n151056736_7\n(ii) Defaulting Lender Waterfall.

Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts\nowed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.16(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by\nsuch Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.\n(iii) Certain Fees.\n(A)No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any fee payable under Section 2.09(a) for any period during\nwhich that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would\nhave been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).\n(B)Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive Letter of Credit Fees for any period during which that Lender\nis a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Applicable Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for\nwhich it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.15.\n(C)With respect to any fee payable under Section 2.09(a) or any Letter of Credit Fee not required to be paid to any\nDefaulting Lender pursuant to clause (A) or (B)\n46\n151056736_7\nabove, the Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such\nDefaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s participation in L/C Obligations that has been reallocated to such\nNon-Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (y) pay to the affected L/C Issuer the amount of any such fee otherwise\npayable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such L/C Issuer’s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender,\nand (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.\n(iv) Reallocation of Applicable Percentages to Reduce Fronting Exposure. All or any part of such Defaulting Lender’s\nparticipation in L/C Obligations shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable\nPercentages (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment) but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth\nin Section 4.02 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless the Borrower shall have otherwise notified the Administrative\nAgent at such time, the Borrower shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and\n(y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure of any Non‑Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non-\nDefaulting Lender’s Commitment. Subject to Section 10.20, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim\nof any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of\na Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such reallocation.\n(v) Cash Collateral.

So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, no L/C Issuer shall be required to issue, extend, increase,\nreinstate or renew any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.\nARTICLE III.

Unless required by Applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to\nfile for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender or an L/C Issuer, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender or any L/C Issuer, any refund of\nTaxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be. If any Recipient determines,\nin its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with\nrespect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such\nrefund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 3.01 with respect to\nthe Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other\nthan any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the\nRecipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant\nGovernmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to the\nBorrower pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such\nRecipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise\nimposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be\nconstrued to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the\nBorrower or any other Person.\n(g)Survival. Each party’s obligations under this Section 3.01 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent\nor any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender or\n51\n151056736_7\nan L/C Issuer, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.\n(h)Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section 3.01, the term “Applicable Law” includes FATCA.\n3.02Illegality. If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is\nunlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to SOFR or\nTerm SOFR, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR or Term SOFR, then, upon notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower\n(through the Administrative Agent), (a) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Term SOFR Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to\nTerm SOFR Loans shall be suspended, and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the\ninterest rate on which is determined by reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of\nsuch Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR\ncomponent of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise\nto such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the\nAdministrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Term SOFR Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base\nRate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term\nSOFR component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such\nTerm SOFR Loan to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loan and (ii) if such notice\nasserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon SOFR, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of\nsuch suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Term SOFR component thereof until the\nAdministrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based\nupon SOFR. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted,\ntogether with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05.\n3.03Inability to Determine Rates.\n(a)If in connection with any request for a Term SOFR Loan or a conversion of Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans or a continuation\nof any of such Loans, as applicable, (i) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that\n(A) no Successor Rate has been determined in accordance with Section 3.03(b), and the circumstances under clause (i) of Section 3.03(b) or the\nScheduled Unavailability Date has occurred, or (B) adequate and reasonable means do not otherwise exist for determining Term SOFR for any\nrequested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term SOFR Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (ii) the\nAdministrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that, for any reason, Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a\nproposed Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so\nnotify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Term SOFR Loans, or to convert Base\nRate Loans to Term SOFR Loans, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of a\ndetermination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Term SOFR\ncomponent in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a determination by the\nRequired Lenders described in clause (ii) of this Section 3.03(a), until the Administrative Agent upon instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes\nsuch notice. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, or conversion to, or\n52\n151056736_7\ncontinuation of Term SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have\nconverted such request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein and (ii) any outstanding\nTerm SOFR Loans shall be deemed to have been converted to Base Rate Loans immediately at the end of their respective applicable Interest\nPeriod.\n(b)Replacement of Term SOFR or Successor Rate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan\nDocuments, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Borrower or Required\nLenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to the Borrower) that the Borrower or Required\nLenders (as applicable) have determined, that:\n(a) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining one month, three month and six month interest periods of\nTerm SOFR, including, without limitation, because the Term SOFR Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis and\nsuch circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or\n(b) CME or any successor administrator of the Term SOFR Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction\nover the Administrative Agent or such administrator with respect to its publication of Term SOFR, in each case acting in such\ncapacity, has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which one month, three month and six month interest periods\nof Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate shall or will no longer be representative or made available, or permitted to be used for\ndetermining the interest rate of U.S. dollar denominated syndicated loans, or shall or will otherwise cease, provided that, at the time\nof such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that will continue to provide\nsuch representative interest periods of Term SOFR after such specific date (the latest date on which one month, three month and six\nmonth interest periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate are no longer representative or available permanently or\nindefinitely, the “Scheduled Unavailability Date”);\nthen, on a date and time determined by the Administrative Agent (any such date, the “Term SOFR Replacement Date”), which date shall be at the\nend of an Interest Period or on the relevant interest payment date, as applicable, for interest calculated and, solely with respect to clause (ii) above,\nno later than the Scheduled Unavailability Date, Term SOFR will be replaced hereunder and under any Loan Document with Daily Simple SOFR\nplus the SOFR Adjustment for any payment period for interest calculated that can be determined by the Administrative Agent, in each case,\nwithout any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document (the “Successor Rate”).\nIf the Successor Rate is Daily Simple SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment, all interest payments will be payable on a quarterly basis.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if the Administrative Agent determines that Daily Simple SOFR is not available on\nor prior to the Term SOFR Replacement Date, or (ii) if the events or circumstances of the type described in Section 3.03(b)(i) or (ii) have occurred\nwith respect to the Successor Rate then in effect, then in each case, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement solely\nfor the purpose of replacing Term SOFR or any then current Successor Rate in accordance with this Section 3.03 at the end of any Interest Period,\nrelevant interest payment date or payment period for interest calculated, as applicable, with an alternative benchmark rate giving due\nconsideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the\nUnited States for such alternative benchmark, and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due\nconsideration to any\n53\n151056736_7\nevolving or then existing convention for similar U.S. dollar denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such\nbenchmark. For the avoidance of doubt, any such proposed rate and adjustments shall constitute a “Successor Rate”. Any such amendment shall\nbecome effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders\nand the Borrower unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice\nthat such Required Lenders object to such amendment.\nThe Administrative Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the Borrower and each Lender of the implementation of any\nSuccessor Rate.\nAny Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided that to the extent such market practice is not\nadministratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by\nthe Administrative Agent.\nNotwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than zero, the\nSuccessor Rate will be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.\nIn connection with the implementation of a Successor Rate, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes\nfrom time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such\nConforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement; provided that, with respect\nto any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the\nBorrower and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective.\nFor purposes of this Section 3.03, those Lenders that either have not made, or do not have an obligation under this Agreement to make,\nthe relevant Loans in Dollars shall be excluded from any determination of Required Lenders.\n3.04Increased Costs.\n(a)Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:\n(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar\nrequirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender or any L/C Issuer;\n(ii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of\nthe definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other\nobligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or\n(iii) impose on any Lender or any L/C Issuer any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Term SOFR\nLoans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;\nand the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan\n(or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or such L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or\nmaintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount\n54\n151056736_7\nof any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon\nrequest of such Lender or such L/C Issuer, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or\namounts as will compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.\n(b)Capital Requirements. If any Lender or any L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or such L/C Issuer\nor any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements\nhas or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or such\nL/C Issuer’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or\nparticipations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender\nor such L/C Issuer or such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into\nconsideration such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s holding company with respect to\ncapital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or\namounts as will compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer or such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s holding company for any such reduction\nsuffered.\n(c)Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender or an L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to\ncompensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and\ndelivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and Administrative Agent will concurrently therewith deliver to the Borrower\ndocumentary evidence on which the Lender’s determination and such certificate are based. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or such L/C\nIssuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.\n(d)Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing\nprovisions of this Section 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s right to demand such compensation, provided\nthat the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any\nincreased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be,\nnotifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s or such L/C Issuer’s intention to\nclaim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-\nmonth period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).\n3.05Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower\nshall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:\n(a)any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of\nthe Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);\n(b)any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or\nconvert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or\n55\n151056736_7\n(c)any assignment of a Term SOFR Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the\nBorrower pursuant to Section 10.13;\nincluding any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain\nsuch Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary\nadministrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.\n3.06Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.\n(a)Designation of a Different Lending Office. Each Lender may make any Credit Extension to the Borrower through any Lending\nOffice, provided that the exercise of this option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Credit Extension in accordance with\nthe terms of this Agreement. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or requires the Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or\nadditional amounts to any Lender, any L/C Issuer, or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or any L/C Issuer pursuant to\nSection 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then at the request of the Borrower such Lender or such L/C Issuer shall, as\napplicable, use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and\nobligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender or such L/C Issuer, such designation or\nassignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the\nneed for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case\nmay be, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be.\nThe Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or any L/C Issuer in connection with any such\ndesignation or assignment.\n(b)Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or if the Borrower is required to pay any\nIndemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01\nand, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 3.06(a), the Borrower\nmay replace such Lender in accordance with Section 10.13.\n3.07Survival.

Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell\nparticipations to any Person (other than a natural Person, or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the\nprimary benefit of one or more natural Persons, a Defaulting Lender or the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a\n“Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment\nand/or the Loans (including such Lender’s participations in L/C Obligations) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this\nAgreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such\nobligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers shall continue to deal solely and directly with such\nLender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be\nresponsible for the indemnity under Section 10.04(c) without regard to the existence of any participation.\nAny agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole\nright to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such\nagreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other\nmodification described in the first proviso to Section 10.01 that affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be\nentitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment\npursuant to subsection (b) of this Section (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.01(e) shall be delivered to the\nLender who sells the participation) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b)\nof this Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 3.06 and 10.13 as if it were an assignee under\nparagraph (b) of this Section and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.01 or 3.04, with respect to any\nparticipation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such\nentitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each\nLender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower’s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to\neffectuate the provisions of Section 3.06 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to\nthe benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a\nLender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on\nwhich it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans\nor other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or\nany portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any\ncommitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is\nnecessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United\nStates Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each\nPerson whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding\nany notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no\nresponsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.\n94\n151056736_7\n(e)Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this\nAgreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a\nFederal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute\nany such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.\n(f) Resignation as L/C Issuer after Assignment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time any L/C\nIssuer assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, such L/C Issuer may, upon 30 days’ notice to the Borrower, the\nAdministrative Agent and the Lenders, resign as an L/C Issuer. In the event of any such resignation as an L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall be\nentitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any\nsuch successor shall affect the resignation of such Lender as an L/C Issuer. If any Lender resigns as an L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights,\npowers, privileges and duties of an L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit issued by it outstanding as of the effective date of its\nresignation as an L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or\nfund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c)).

To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a\nguarantee or otherwise, for any Swap Contract or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “QFC Credit Support”, and each\nsuch QFC, a “Supported QFC”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\n(together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “U.S. Special Resolution Regimes”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit\nSupport (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be\ngoverned by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):\n(a)In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered Party”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a\nU.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation\nin or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit\nSupport) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution\nRegime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws\nof the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a\nproceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported\nQFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such\nDefault Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by\nthe laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and\nremedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported\nQFC or any QFC Credit Support.\n(b)As used in this Section 10.21, the following terms have the following meanings:\n“BHC Act Affiliate” of a party means an “affiliate” (as such term is defined under, and interpreted in accordance\nwith, 12 U.S.C. 1841(k)) of such party.\n“Covered Entity” means any of the following: (i) a “covered entity” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in\naccordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 252.82(b); (ii) a “covered bank” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12\nC.F.R. § 47.3(b); or (iii) a “covered FSI” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 382.2(b).\n“Default Right” has the meaning assigned to that term in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. §§\n252.81, 47.2 or 382.1, as applicable.\n102\n151056736_7\n“QFC” has the meaning assigned to the term “qualified financial contract” in, and shall be interpreted in accordance\nwith, 12 U.S.C. 5390(c)(8)(D).\n10.22Customary Marketing Materials.
