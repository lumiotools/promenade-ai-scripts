(Nasdaq: KIRK) (\"Kirkland's\"), a specialty retailer focused on delivering \"Always Something New\" through its on-trend and seasonally relevant home decor at a great price, and Beyond, Inc. (NYSE: BYON) (\"Beyond\"), owner of Bed Bath & Beyond, Overstock, Zulily, and other online retail brands designed to unlock your home's potential, today announced that they have entered into a strategic partnership that will enable cohesive collaboration, leveraging the strengths of each business to drive sustainable profitable growth and value for all stakeholders.We believe each company will enhance the revenue and earnings potential for both businesses through the following initiatives: Kirkland's to become Beyond's exclusive brick-and-mortar operator and licensee for new, smaller format (up to 15k square feet) 'neighborhood' Bed Bath & Beyond locations nationwide, highlighting a curated assortment of iconic legacy vendor partners while also leveraging Kirkland's store operations expertise and its brick-and-mortar footprint to identify potential store conversion opportunities or new markets.Capitalizing on Kirkland's merchandising, product development and sourcing teams to expand the reach of Kirkland's Home product assortment, including furniture, rugs and textiles as well as its industry leading core décor business, across the expanded store network, Beyond's websites and other marketplaces.Leveraging an enhanced supply chain network to reduce costs, improve inventory management, and drive revenue growth.Kirkland's to participate in Beyond's consumer data collective, global loyalty program, financial services, and consumer protection products, with the expectation to drive traffic and revenue while increasing conversion and lower both customer acquisition and retention costs.Beyond to support Kirkland's digital transformation to drive improvements in e-commerce technology to improve customer experience and conversion driving profitable revenue growth in this channel.\"Having known the iconic Bed Bath & Beyond brand for years, we are thrilled to partner with Marcus and the entire Beyond team to bring the brick-and-mortar strategy back to life\", said Amy Sullivan, CEO of Kirkland's Inc. \"Kirkland's Home has a 58-year legacy in the home decor sector, and the core strength of our brand and this organization lies in merchandising and store operations. As we have demonstrated this year, we are a merchant-led organization focused on great product design and development with a strong and diverse sourcing strategy. We are also operators who leverage our brick-and-mortar footprint and channel expertise to create a memorable customer experience. We expect the investment from Beyond will not only enhance our financial performance but also provide meaningful opportunities to introduce Kirkland's to new customers in a cost-efficient manner while we continue to re-engage our core customer and extend our reach across multiple formats. We plan to leverage the core strengths of the Beyond team by accessing its digital and technical expertise.\"Ms. Sullivan continued, \"We believe all elements of this collaboration will drive value to both our brands and all of our stakeholders. We appreciate the support from John Lewis and Osmium Partners who have continued to champion Kirkland's and believe in the opportunities that this relationship provides as we continue to position Kirkland's for long term success. We thank them for supporting this transaction and for their vision, strategic insights, and shareholder advocacy.\"\"An omnichannel approach to Bed Bath & Beyond is quintessential to its success,\" said Marcus Lemonis, Executive Chairman of Beyond, Inc. \"We understand that retail is both an art and a science and have vetted the management team and infrastructure of Kirkland's Home as an ideal organization to help bring the iconic Bed Bath & Beyond brand back. The key to retail is efficiency in assortment, space management, sourcing, and merchandising, all while recognizing that smaller, tighter footprints with significantly lower fixed cost models is a winning recipe. We are very excited to work with the Kirkland's board and Amy, along with her entire management team, as we reinvigorate the Bed Bath & Beyond brand.\" We view this partnership as a meaningful step forward in our long-term vision of growing through asset-light collaboration with complementary businesses while monetizing both the intellectual property of our iconic brands as well as the suite of affinity products being developed.\"Transaction TermsOn October 21, 2024, Kirkland's entered into a $17 million Term Loan Credit Agreement with Beyond (the \"Beyond Term Loan\"), $8.5 million of which consists of a convertible note that will convert into Kirkland's common stock at a price of $1.85 per share (the \"Conversion Price\") upon the approval of Kirkland's shareholders.

In addition, on October 21, 2024, the parties entered into a subscription agreement (the \"Subscription Agreement\") pursuant to which Beyond will purchase an additional $8 million of Kirkland's common stock at the Conversion Price upon the approval of Kirkland's shareholders. The parties also entered into a seven-year collaboration agreement (the \"Collaboration Agreement\"), pursuant to which Beyond will earn a collaboration fee equal to 0.25% of Kirkland's quarterly retail and e-commerce revenue starting in Kirkland's first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2025 for the remaining term of the Collaboration Agreement and an incentive fee equal to 1.5% of Kirkland's incremental growth in e-commerce revenue during the term of the Collaboration Agreement.

(Nasdaq: KIRK) (\"Kirkland's Home\" or the \"Company\"), a specialty retailer of home décor and furnishings, announced financial results for the 13-week and 26-week periods ended August 3, 2024. [ ![Kirkland's Home \\(PRNewsfoto/Kirkland's, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1819100/Kirklands_Home_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1819100/Kirklands_Home_Logo.html) **Second Quarter 2024 Summary**\n\n  *  _Net sales of $86.3 million; Overall comparable sales decreased 1.7%, inclusive of 1.8% growth in comparable brick-and-mortar stores compared to Q2 2023._\n  * _Gross profit margin expanded 100 bps to 20.5% compared to Q2 2023._\n  * _Operating loss of $13.3 million, a $4.8 million improvement compared to Q2 2023._\n  * _Adjusted EBITDA loss of $10.2 million, a $3.3 million improvement compared to Q2 2023._\n  * _Closed 4 stores to end the quarter with 325 stores._\n  * _Ended the period with a cash balance of $4.5 million and $62.7 million in outstanding debt._\n\n**Management Commentary** Amy Sullivan, CEO of Kirkland's Home, said, \"Our second quarter comparable sales results reflect a sequential improvement from the first quarter and continued progress against our strategic initiatives. Our merchandising and marketing plans have continued to drive traffic to our stores resulting in positive comparable sales performance in the channel helping to offset the headwinds we are experiencing with our e-commerce business. Toward the end of the quarter, we began to introduce our fall and holiday assortment, and we are encouraged by our early reads, giving us further confidence in our plans for the second half of the year and our peak selling season. Through our ongoing efforts to re-engage our core customer, refocus our product assortment, and strengthen our omnichannel capabilities, we are positioning Kirkland's for improved financial performance and long-term success.\" **Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results** Net sales in the second quarter of 2024 were $86.3 million, compared to $89.5 million in the prior year quarter. Comparable sales decreased 1.7%, including a 10.6% decline in e-commerce sales and a 1.8% increase in comparable store sales. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in consolidated average ticket and e-commerce traffic, partially offset by an increase in store traffic and conversion. Gross profit in the second quarter of 2024 was $17.7 million, or 20.5% of net sales, compared to $17.4 million, or 19.5% of net sales in the prior year quarter. The improvement as a percentage of net sales was primarily a result of increased merchandise margin, largely due to favorable shrink results and lower outbound freight costs, partially offset by the deleverage of store occupancy costs. Operating expenses in the second quarter of 2024 were $31.0 million, or 35.9% of net sales, compared to $35.5 million, or 39.7% of net sales in the prior year quarter. The decline in operating expenses was driven by reduced advertising costs, asset impairment charges and corporate salaries and benefits expenses. In addition, we received a state tax refund due to a recent change in state tax law that offset operating expenses in the quarter. Operating loss in the second quarter of 2024 was $13.3 million compared to operating loss of $18.1 million in the prior year quarter. The improvement was primarily a result of the aforementioned lower operating expenses. Adjusted operating loss in the second quarter of 2024 was $12.7 million compared to adjusted operating loss of $16.6 million in the prior year quarter. EBITDA in the second quarter of 2024 was a loss of $10.8 million compared to a loss of $14.0 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2024 was a loss of $10.2 million compared to a loss of $13.5 million in the prior year quarter. Net loss in the second quarter of 2024 was $14.5 million, or a loss of $1.11 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $19.4 million, or a loss of $1.51 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. **Balance Sheet** As of August 3, 2024, inventory was $92.8 million, a 6.3% decrease compared to the prior year quarter, mainly due to a 4.4% decrease in store count as well as the closure of one e-commerce distribution location in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. As of August 3, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of $4.5 million, with $52.7 million of outstanding debt under its $90.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility and $10.0 million of outstanding debt under its $12.0 million \"first-in, last-out\" asset-based term loan. As of August 3, 2024, the Company had approximately $7.9 million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility and the term loan, after the minimum required excess availability covenant. The Company's inventories are typically at seasonal lows during the first quarter of the fiscal year and begin to build as the second quarter progresses. Availability under the Company's revolving credit facility and term loan fluctuates largely based on eligible inventory levels, and as eligible inventory increases in the second and third fiscal quarters in support of the Company's back-half sales plans, the Company's borrowing capacity increases correspondingly. The Company anticipates that cash flow from seasonal sales in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2024 will be used to reduce borrowing levels and increase liquidity. Subsequent to August 3, 2024, the Company borrowed an additional $5.7 million under the revolving credit facility, and as of September 5, 2024, the Company had $58.4 million of outstanding debt under its revolving credit facility and $10.0 million in borrowings under its term loan. **Cost Savings Initiatives and Review of Strategic Alternatives** As previously announced, during the second quarter, the Company implemented several cost savings initiatives to better align its cost structure with the current business environment. The Company believes these actions are necessary as part of improving its profitability and liquidity trajectory while minimizing disruption to the Company's focus on its strategic initiatives and the overall customer experience. The cost savings initiatives include a reduction in corporate overhead, store payroll, marketing and third-party technology expenses. In the second through fourth quarters of fiscal 2024, the Company expects to realize approximately $6 million of savings and estimates approximately $7 million in ongoing annual pre-tax savings from these initiatives. As previously disclosed, the Company is currently engaged in the pursuit and evaluation of potential strategic opportunities to support the Company and its initiatives. This process is ongoing. The Company has not set a deadline or definitive timetable for the completion of the strategic alternatives review process, and there can be no assurance that this process will result in any particular outcome. The Company does not intend to comment further regarding the review of strategic alternatives until it determines disclosure is necessary or advisable. **Conference Call** Kirkland's Home management will host a conference call to discuss its financial results for the second quarter ended August 3, 2024, followed by a question-and-answer period with President and CEO, Amy Sullivan, and EVP and CFO, Mike Madden.

(\"GAAP\"), this earnings release and the related earnings conference call contain certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating loss. These measures are not in accordance with, and are not intended as alternatives to, GAAP financial measures. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believes that they provide useful information to analysts and investors, as a supplement to GAAP financial measures, in evaluating the Company's operational performance.\n\nThe Company defines EBITDA as net loss before interest and the provision for income tax, which is equivalent to operating loss, adjusted for depreciation and asset impairment, adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA with non-GAAP adjustments and adjusted operating loss as adjusted EBITDA including depreciation.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meanings prescribed by GAAP. Use of these terms may differ from similar measures reported by other companies. Each non-GAAP financial measure has its limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP adjustments remove stock based compensation expense, due to the non-cash nature of this expense, and remove severance, as it fluctuates based on the needs of the business and does not represent a normal, recurring operating expense.\n\nThe following table shows an unaudited non-GAAP measure reconciliation of operating loss to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating loss (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\n\n**13-Week Period Ended** | **26-Week Period Ended**  \n---|---  \n**August 3, 2024** | **July 29, 2023** | **August 3, 2024** | **July 29, 2023**  \nOperating loss | $ | (13,322) | $ | (18,091) | $ | (20,830) | $ | (28,428)  \nDepreciation | 2,513 | 3,092 | 5,137 | 6,349  \nAsset impairment (1) | 20 | 1,001 | 31 | 1,226  \nEBITDA | (10,789) | (13,998) | (15,662) | (20,853)  \nNon-GAAP adjustments to operating expenses:  \nStock-based compensation expense(2) | 264 | 124 | 556 | 614  \nSeverance charges(3) | 317 | 378 | 390 | 907  \nTotal non-GAAP adjustments | 581 | 502 | 946 | 1,521  \nAdjusted EBITDA | (10,208) | (13,496) | (14,716) | (19,332)  \nDepreciation | 2,513 | 3,092 | 5,137 | 6,349  \nAdjusted operating loss | $ | (12,721) | $ | (16,588) | $ | (19,853) | $ | (25,681)  \n  \n(1) | Asset impairment charges are related to property and equipment, software costs and cloud computing implementation costs. Asset impairment was previously shown as a non-GAAP adjustment. The current presentation includes asset impairment as a reconciling item between operating loss and EBITDA. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.  \n---|---  \n(2) | Stock-based compensation expense includes amounts amortized to expense related to equity incentive plans.  \n(3) | Severance charges include expenses related to severance agreements and permanent store closure compensation costs.  \n  \n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CL98556&sd=2024-09-05) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kirklands-home-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302239304.html>\n\nSOURCE Kirkland's, Inc.  \n  \n**My Account****[My Account](#accountCollapse)**\n\n  * [My Profile](https://www.kirklands.com/user/personal_info.jsp?icid=footer_MyProfile)\n  * [Track My Order](https://www.kirklands.com/checkout/order_status.jsp?icid=footer_TrackMyOrder)\n  * [Order History](https://www.kirklands.com/user/orderhistory.jsp?icid=footer_OrderHistory)\n  * [Returns & Exchanges](https://www.kirklands.com/custserv/custserv.jsp?pageName=Returns&icid=footer_ReturnsAndExchanges)\n  * [Shipping & Delivery](https://www.kirklands.com/custserv/custserv.jsp?pageName=Shipping&icid=footer_ShippingAndDelivery)\n  * [Credit Card](https://www.kirklands.com/content.jsp?pageName=CreditCard&icid=footer_KCreditCard)\n  * [K Club](https://www.kirklands.com/content.jsp?pageName=KClubRewards&icid=footer_KClub)\n\n\n\n**About Kirkland's** **[About Kirkland's](#aboutCollapse)**\n\n  * [About Us](https://www.kirklands.com/custserv/custserv.jsp?pageName=About&icid=footer_AboutUs)\n  * [Careers](https://www.kirklands.com/content.jsp?pageName=careers&icid=footer_Careers)\n  * [Community](https://www.kirklands.com/content.jsp?pageName=Community_Page&icid=footer_Community)\n  * [Investor Relations](https://ir.kirklands.com/?icid=footer_InvestorAndMediaRelations)\n  * [Corporate Responsibility](https://www.kirklands.com/custserv/custserv.jsp?pageName=SocialCompliance&icid=footer_CorporateResponsibility)\n  * [Corporate Sales](https://www.kirklands.com/custserv/custserv.jsp?pageName=CorporateSales&icid=footer_CorporateSales)\n\n\n\n**Shop Kirkland's** **[Shop Kirkland's](#shopCollapse)**\n\n  * [Shop Collections](https://www.kirklands.com/category/Collections-New-Arrivals/Collections/pc/2384/3028.uts?icid=footer_Collections)\n  * [Store Locator](https://www.kirklands.com/custserv/locate_store.cmd?icid=footer_StoreLocator)\n  * [Ship to Store](https://www.kirklands.com/custserv/custserv.jsp?pageName=FAQShiptoStore&icid=footer_STSitems)\n  * [Pick up in Store](https://www.kirklands.com/custserv/custserv.jsp?pageName=FAQPickup&icid=footer_BOPISitems)\n  * [Gift Cards](https://www.kirklands.com/content.jsp?pageName=giftcard&icid=footer_GiftCards)\n  * [Blog](https://www.kirklands.com/blog/?icid=footer_Blog)\n\n\n\n**Customer Service****[Customer Service](#csCollapse)**\n\n  * [Read FAQs](https://www.kirklands.com/custserv/custserv.jsp?pageName=FAQs&icid=footer_FAQ)\n  * [Email Us](https://www.kirklands.com/custserv/contactus.jsp?icid=footer_EmailUs)\n  * Call 1-877-541-4855\n\n\n\n![Kirkland's](https://d36cz9elvz3vfp.cloudfront.net/2097/Kirklands-Logo-Black.svg)\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/Kirklands?icid=footer_Facebook \"Kirklands Facebook Page\") [](https://instagram.com/kirklands#%20?icid=footer_Instagram \"Kirklands instagram Page\") [](https://pinterest.com/kirklandshome/?icid=footer_Pinterest \"Kirklands Pinterest Page\") [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/40755?icid=footer_Linkedin \"Kirklands LinkedIn Page\") [](https://www.twitter.com/kirklands?icid=footer_Twitter \"Kirklands Twitter Page\")[](https://plus.google.com/115177918000184366554/posts?icid=footer_GooglePlus \"Kirklands Google+ Page\")\n\n© 2024 Kirkland's.

Fiscal 2023 was a transitional year\nfor our company, marked by significant strategic changes aimed at returning to our value heritage and\npositioning our brand to reignite growth. While macro challenges persisted, we made substantial\nprogress in key areas that have paved the way for stabilization and a return to long-term profitability.\nPutting the Customer First and Revitalizing our Product Assortment\nOur overarching priority throughout the year was to realign our value proposition and reestablish a deep\nconnection with our core customer. Through revitalized merchandising and marketing strategies, we\nemphasized faster-turning categories at great value that resonate with today's consumer. This focus and\nour re-commitment to our “Always Something New” mindset helped to support our efforts to reactivate\nlapsed customers and reignite their passion for our brand.\nStrengthening Our Omnichannel Presence\nWe aim to deliver an omni-channel experience that meets our customer whenever and wherever she\nwants to shop. In fiscal 2023, we made nice progress in driving improved traffic and conversion in our\nbrick-and-mortar stores in the latter part of the year, and plan to build on this momentum in the\nchannel going forward while evaluating longer-term opportunities for new store growth. In addition, we\nhave taken steps to enhance our e-commerce experience, including a planned replatforming in fiscal\n2025 to provide a modernized, user-friendly experience.\nOperational Excellence and Financial Discipline\nThroughout the year, we maintained a disciplined approach to operational effectiveness and financial\nstewardship. We streamlined our supply chain, reduced inventory levels, and optimized labor efficiency\nwithin our distribution network, resulting in significant gross margin improvement. Additionally, we\nimplemented strict expense control measures, positioning us to generate positive adjusted EBITDA in\nfiscal 2024.\nLooking Ahead with Confidence\nI want to thank Ann Joyce for her guidance and leadership over the past year as our Interim CEO. I am\nhonored to follow her and carry forward her commitment to our customers, associates, and\nshareholders. As we move forward, our strategic priorities remain focused on delivering curated, on-\ntrend, and seasonally relevant home décor at exceptional value and unlocking the true potential of the\nKirkland’s Home brand. I look forward to building a strong relationship with all of you.

Business\nGeneral\nWe are a specialty retailer of home décor and furnishings in the United States. As of February 3, 2024, we\noperated a total of 330 stores in 35 states as well as an e-commerce website, www.kirklands.com, under the Kirkland’s\nHome brand. We were founded in 1966, and our current parent corporation, Kirkland’s, Inc., was incorporated in\n1981. We provide our customers with an engaging shopping experience characterized by a curated, affordable\nselection of home décor and furnishings along with inspirational design ideas. This combination of quality and stylish\nmerchandise, value pricing and a stimulating in-store and online environment provides our customers with a unique\nbrand experience.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur mission is to make Kirkland’s the destination for seasonally relevant home décor, furnishings and gifts. We\nstrive to offer on-trend, curated product assortments at a great value. We are rebalancing our value proposition by\nmoderating the growth in high ticket categories and maximizing our position in value home accents, seasonal décor\nand gifts at amazing price points to appeal to our core value customer. We are focused on re-engaging our customer\nbase and extending the reach of our brand to new customers. We believe the following four components of our business\nstrategy are key to positioning our brand and our future growth and success.\nCustomer. We are committed to keeping the voice of the customer at the center of our brand; and we are resetting\nour brand voice and marketing tactics to acquire, reactivate and retain her.\nMerchandise. We are committed to being product obsessed, delivering a unique omni-channel product strategy\nof curated, on-trend and seasonally relevant home décor at a great price. We will be known for “always something\nnew” to drive demand in each quarter throughout the year.\nOmni-channel experience. We will deliver a channel strategy that meets our customers whenever and wherever\nthey want to shop while driving a path to profitable growth in both stores and e-commerce.

We are passionate about our color\nand design direction each season, while working with our partners around the globe to develop and source quality\nhome décor, furnishings and gifts. We maintain a strong pricing strategy with affordable prices representing a great\nvalue to our customers across all product categories. Our merchant team thoughtfully curates the assortment each\nseason to ensure we maintain a healthy SKU count and a cohesive style point of view.\nDaily review of sales and product margin information helps us to maximize the productivity of successful\nproducts and categories and minimize the accumulation of slow-moving inventory. We regularly monitor the sell-\nthrough of our merchandise; therefore, the number and make-up of our active items is continuously changing based\non changes in selling trends. The composition of our merchandise assortment is relatively consistent across our store\nbase with an extended assortment online.\nWe continually strive to increase the perceived value of Kirkland’s products to our customers through our\nthoughtfully curated assortments and inspirational visual presentations. Our shoppers regularly experience the\nsatisfaction of paying noticeably less for equally well-designed products compared to those sold by other specialty\nretailers. We use temporary promotions throughout the year featuring specific categories of merchandise along with\n4\nselect coupon discounts. We believe our great style and value-oriented pricing strategy, coupled with an adherence to\nhigh quality standards, is an important element in establishing our distinct brand identity and solidifying our\nconnection with our customers.\nOur merchandise categories include holiday décor, furniture, textiles, decorative accessories, art, home\nfragrance, ornamental wall décor, mirrors, housewares, lighting, floral, outdoor and gift. The following table presents\nthe percentage of net sales contributed by our merchandise categories based on our current category structure over the\nlast three fiscal years:\n% of Net Sales\nMerchandise Category Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2021\nHoliday Décor 20% 19% 19%\nFurniture 17 18 15\nTextiles 11 11 10\nDecorative Accessories 9 7 8\nArt 8 8 8\nHome Fragrance 7 7 6\nOrnamental Wall Décor 6 8 10\nMirrors 6 7 6\nHousewares 4 4 5\nLighting 4 4 5\nFloral 4 4 4\nOutdoor 3 3 3\nGift 1 0 1\nTotal 100% 100% 100%\nOur visual merchandising strategy is continuously evolving to meet the vision of our assortment. We strive to\ninspire our customers with a mix of inspirational lifestyle settings and impactful key item placement. Our visual\nmerchandising team creates thoughtful, cohesive guides for our stores, utilizing fresh, creative window displays and\nmaximizing the productivity of our fixtures.\nBuying and Inventory Management\nOur buying team approves the design of all of our products, negotiates with vendors and works with our\nmerchandise planning and allocation team to optimize merchandise quantity and mix by category in our stores and on\nour website. We purchase merchandise from approximately 180 vendors, with no vendor representing more than 10%\nof our purchases during fiscal 2023. Approximately 80 core vendors accounted for 90% of our merchandise purchases\nduring fiscal 2023.\nOur global sourcing team manages our sourcing strategies, and it has successfully diversified our purchases from\nprimarily Chinese vendors to suppliers in multiple countries. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, direct sourcing accounted for\napproximately 47% and 49% of our merchandise purchases, respectively. We partner with three sourcing agents that\nassist with sourcing activities in China, India, Southeast Asia and Europe. Our merchandise comes from numerous\nforeign and domestic manufacturers and importers. For fiscal 2023, the manufacturing countries of origin for our\nmerchandise receipts were approximately 73% China, 14% India, 8% United States, 3% Vietnam and 2% other\ncountries. Our strategy is to continue to diversify sourcing opportunities and minimize risks to gain competitive\nadvantages through a streamlined process.\nOur merchandise planning and allocation team manages inventory levels and the allocation between stores and\ne-commerce fulfillment locations to maximize sales, sell-through and margin. Our stores are classified internally for\nassortment purposes based on multiple criteria including sales volume, size, location and historical performance.\nAlthough our stores carry similar merchandise, the variety and depth of products in a given store may vary depending\non the store’s classification. Where applicable, inventory purchases and allocations are also tailored based on regional\nor demographic differences between stores in selected categories. On our website, we carry a larger selection of\nmerchandise than in our store locations, including online-exclusive items.\n5\nStore Operations\nOur stores are designed and managed to make shopping an inspiring experience and to maximize sales and\noperating efficiencies. Stores are strategically arranged to provide for optimal product placement and visual display\nthat can be changed for seasonal product and promotions. Store training is focused on increasing customer design\nassistance, having a selling mindset and operational efficiency.\nStore operations is managed by corporate personnel, two regional directors and 16 district managers, who have\nresponsibility for an average of 21 stores within a geographic district, and store managers. Store managers and assistant\nmanagers are responsible for the day-to-day operation of the store, including sales, customer service, merchandise\ndisplay, talent development and store security. A typical store operates seven days a week with an average of 8 to 15\nemployees, including a combination of full and part-time employees, depending on the volume of the store and the\nseason. Additional part-time employees are typically hired to assist with the increased traffic and sales volume in the\nfourth quarter of the calendar year.\nReal Estate\nOur store strategy emphasizes maintaining our store count, while still exiting under-performing stores and\nrelocating selected stores to better locations. We are prioritizing improvement in overall profitability and developing\na future state plan for infrastructure that complements our omni-channel concept and improves the customer\nexperience. Annually, we anticipate a small amount of store closures and limited store openings, as we execute our\nstore strategy over the next several years.\nAs of February 3, 2024, we operated 330 stores, including 284 “power” strip or “lifestyle” centers, 22\nfreestanding locations, 12 mall locations and 12 outlet centers.\nThe following table provides a history of our store openings and closings for the last five fiscal years:\nFiscal Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal\n2023 2022 2021 2020 2019\nStores open at beginning of period 346 361 373 432 428\nNew store openings — 1 4 — 5\nPermanent store closings (16) (16) (16) (59) (1)\nStores open at end of period 330 346 361 373 432\nDistribution and Logistics\nWe have a comprehensive approach to the management of our merchandise supply chain. We continuously\nevaluate the impact of our omni-channel strategies on our business, and frequently implement enhancements to our\nsupply chain infrastructure and warehouse management system to support store and e-commerce fulfillment.\nOur main retail distribution center in Jackson, Tennessee services approximately 65% of our stores and a third-\nparty operated retail fulfillment facility in Lancaster, Texas services the other 35% of our stores. Our main Jackson,\nTennessee retail distribution center also supports our e-commerce fulfillment. In 2023, we closed our North Las Vegas,\nNevada and Winchester, Virginia e-commerce order fulfillment centers to reduce fixed costs and consolidate our\noperations. We also have a third-party operated west coast distribution operation, which provides for the improved\nflow of merchandise through our supply chain network. By virtue of this operation, we gain control of merchandise\nwhen it enters the west coast port, which allows us to allocate and distribute inventory directly to any of our retail or\ne-commerce fulfillment distribution centers.\nOur internal warehouse management system provides functionality that supports store and e-commerce\nfulfillment. In early fiscal 2022, we upgraded our internal warehouse management system related to store fulfillment\nat our Jackson, Tennessee location.\n6\nWe currently utilize third-party carriers to transport merchandise from our Jackson, Tennessee and Lancaster,\nTexas distribution centers to our stores. Almost all of our stores utilize direct, full truckload deliveries, which results\nin lower distribution costs and allows our field personnel to better schedule store associates for the receiving process.\nInformation Technology\nWe invest in our information technology to manage the purchase, pricing and distribution of our merchandise,\nimprove our operating efficiencies and support omni-channel operations. Our key management information systems\ninclude a merchandise management system, point-of-sale system, an e-commerce platform, an e-commerce order\nmanagement system, a warehouse management system, a financial system and a labor management tool. Our\nmerchandise management system provides us with tools to manage aspects of our merchandise assortment and\nintegrates merchandising and inventory management applications, including inventory tracking, purchase order\nmanagement, inventory allocation and replenishment, sales audit and invoice matching, which interfaces with our\nwarehouse management and financial system.\nWe continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize their effectiveness as well as\nseek out best in class solutions to enhance operational efficiencies. Such efforts include ongoing hardware and\nsoftware evaluations, and refreshes and upgrades to support optimal software configurations and application\nperformance. We continue to strengthen the security of our information technology and invest in technology to support\nstores, e-commerce, distribution centers, omni-channel expansion and business intelligence tools. These efforts are\ndirected toward improving business processes, maintaining secure, efficient and stable systems, implementing new\nfeatures and enabling the continued growth and success of our business.\nMarketing\nOur brand positioning aligns to the evolution of our product assortment and clearly communicates our value\nproposition of, “Curated Design, Amazing Value.” Our marketing communicates that Kirkland’s Home is a shopping\ndestination that offers on trend, quality home merchandise at a value to our customers. We believe that just because\ncustomers are practical with their time and money does not mean that their passion for their home does not run deep.\nOur marketing showcases our products in a casual, surprising and approachable way that is both inspirational and\nattainable.\nOur marketing strategy includes customer retention, as well as new customer acquisition. Our overall marketing\nefforts encompass various tactics including digital marketing, paid search and social media initiatives. We manage a\ndatabase of customers and communicate with them via targeted emails featuring new products, marketing events and\nspecial offers.\nWe are focused on improving the customer experience through our loyalty program, K-club, and our private\nlabel credit card financing options. Our customer loyalty program rewards customers for shopping with us, as well as\ninteracting with Kirkland's across channels. This interaction allows us to foster stronger and lasting relationships with\nour customers. The key benefits of this program include points on every purchase to redeem for valuable rewards,\nbirthday surprises and special offers.\nOur private label Kirkland’s credit card through Wells Fargo offers financing options including \"6-months no\ninterest\" and \"12-months no interest\" financing for purchases over $250 and $500, respectively.\nOmni-Channel\nOur strategy is to meet our customers whenever and wherever they want to shop by creating meaningful content\nthat engages the customer and either converts them online or allows them to pre-shop for an in-store purchase. We are\nalso improving our website platform to provide an engaging shopping experience for our customers. We will do this\n7\nby developing an endless aisle experience through web marketing, site merchandising tactics and an extended product\nassortment.\nAs part of our omni-channel growth strategy, we are focused on improving comparable sales performance both\nin store and online. We are focused on improving the contribution of our store base, which is an integral part of our\nomni-channel strategy and supports improved profitability of our e-commerce business as a fulfillment channel.\nWe have multiple online fulfillment options, including delivery to the customer’s home directly from our\nwarehouses or from vendors, ship-to-store and buy online and pickup in-store programs.\nTrademarks\nAll of our stores operate under the names “Kirkland’s”, “Kirkland’s Home”, “Kirkland’s Home Outlet”,\n“Kirkland’s Outlet,” and “The Kirkland Collection.”\nWe have registered several trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on the Principal\nRegister that are used in connection with the Kirkland’s stores, including KIRKLAND’S® logo design,\nKIRKLAND’S®, THE KIRKLAND COLLECTION®, KIRKLAND’S OUTLET®, KIRKLAND’S HOME®,\nMARKET AND VINE™, SIMPLE THINGS BY KIRKLAND’S®, LOVE THE POSSIBILITIES and LOVE THE\nPRICE®. These trademarks have historically been important components in our merchandising and marketing\nstrategy. We are not aware of any claims of infringement or other challenges to our right to use our trademarks in the\nUnited States.\nCompetition\nThe retail market for home furnishings is highly competitive. Accordingly, we compete against a diverse group\nof retailers, including specialty stores, department stores, discount stores, catalog and internet-based retailers, which\nsell similar lines of merchandise to those carried by us. Some of our main competitors include HomeGoods,\nHomeSense, Walmart, World Market, Crate & Barrel, Williams-Sonoma, Inc., Hobby Lobby, At Home, Target, Ebay,\nAmazon and Wayfair. We believe that the principal competitive factors influencing our business are merchandise\nselection, price, customer service, visual appeal of our stores and our convenient store locations. We believe we\ncompete effectively with other retailers due to our experience in identifying a curated collection of quality and stylish\nmerchandise, pricing it to be attractive to our target customer, presenting it in a visually appealing manner and\nproviding an engaging shopping experience.\nIn addition to competing for customers, we compete with other retailers for suitable store locations and qualified\nmanagement personnel and sales associates. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater\nfinancial, marketing and other resources than we do. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K, under the sub-\ncaption “Risks Related to Competition” for further discussion of our competitive environment.\nHuman Capital\nOverview. We employed approximately 900 full-time and 3,200 part-time employees as of February 3, 2024.\nThe number of our employees fluctuates with seasonal needs. We generally experience our highest level of\nemployment during the fourth fiscal quarter. Of our 4,100 employees, approximately 3,750 work at stores, 150 work\nat our distribution centers and 200 work in corporate support functions. As of February 3, 2024, none of our employees\nare unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we maintain a positive relationship\nwith our employees.\nPhilosophy and culture. Our goal is to employ a highly engaged, high-performing workforce that is happy and\nempowered. Our people philosophy is based on creating a workplace culture where all employees feel respected,\nvalued and inspired. We actively engage employees in regular opportunities to feel connected to our goals and the\ncommunities in which we operate. We celebrate and prioritize diversity and inclusion and position employees for\nsuccess with the tools and resources they need to thrive.\n8\nPersonnel recruitment and training. We believe our continued success is dependent in part on our ability to\nattract, retain and motivate quality employees. In particular, our success depends on our ability to promote and recruit\nqualified corporate personnel, distribution center employees, district and store managers and full-time and part-time\nstore employees. District managers are primarily responsible for recruiting new store managers, while store managers\nare responsible for the hiring and training of store employees. We constantly look for motivated and talented people\nto promote from within the Company, in addition to recruiting outside of Kirkland’s. All store employees are trained\nutilizing the “K University” training program. Store managers train at a designated “training store” where they work\ndirectly with a qualified training store manager. District managers onboard at our corporate office in addition to\nspending time with designated district manager trainers. Corporate and distribution center employees receive training\nat their respective locations.\nCompensation and benefits. We are committed to providing competitive pay and benefits to our employees.\nCorporate management, distribution center leadership, regional directors, district managers and store managers are\ncompensated with base pay plus periodic bonuses based on performance. Store and distribution center non-\nmanagement employees are compensated on an hourly basis in addition to periodic contests and rewards. Many of our\nemployees participate in one of our various bonus incentive programs, which provide the opportunity to receive\nadditional compensation based upon department or Company performance. We also provide our eligible employees\nthe opportunity to participate in a 401(k) retirement savings plan, which includes a 100% Company match of the\nemployee’s elective bi-weekly contributions up to 4% of eligible compensation. We share in the cost of health\ninsurance provided to eligible employees, and we offer our employees a discount on merchandise purchased from our\nstores.\nSafety. Employee health and safety is continuously promoted through training and resources across our\noperations. We develop and administer Company-wide policies to ensure the safety of each employee and compliance\nwith Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards.\nDiversity. Our leadership team is comprised of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, two senior\nvice presidents and three vice presidents who, collectively, have management responsibility for our business areas\nincluding store operations, supply chain, e-commerce, finance, legal, merchandising, human resources, marketing and\ninformation technology. Our leadership team places significant focus and attention on matters concerning our human\ncapital assets including their capability development, succession planning and diversity. Accordingly, we regularly\nreview talent development and succession plans for each of our functions, to identify and develop a pipeline of talent\nto maintain business operations. We are also focused on engaging our existing workforce through policies and\nprograms promoting workplace diversity and inclusion. Currently, the majority of the members of our leadership team\nare women. We are committed to our continued efforts to promote diversity and foster an inclusive work environment\nthat supports the communities we serve. As part of this commitment, in 2021, we created an employee Diversity\nCouncil with cross-organizational representatives who advocate for and monitor our commitment to diversity and\ninclusion. We have executed training focused on driving inclusion and celebrated events spotlighting inclusion and\ndiversity within our organization. We recruit the best people for the job regardless of race, gender, ethnicity or other\nprotected traits, and it is our policy to fully comply with all laws applicable to discrimination in the workplace.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)\nWe have made ESG and diversity and inclusion a priority throughout our organization and the communities we\nserve. As our business evolves over time, sustainability will continue to increase in significance as we revise and\ndevelop our stores and e-commerce operations. However, as we note in “Item 2. Properties” of this Form 10-K, we\ncurrently lease all of our properties, so there are limited actions we can take with respect to environmental\nsustainability issues. Nevertheless, we seek to ensure that all future changes to our stores, including any possible real\nproperty acquisitions, are done in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. Our leadership team has worked\nwith our ESG Steering Committee and our Board to develop short-term and long-term ESG strategies. One of our\nsustainability pledges is to strengthen the local communities in which we operate, and our various corporate giving\ninitiatives have helped elevate our impact on these local communities.\nIn September 2021, we added an ESG section to our Investor Relations website at www.kirklands.com under\n“Investor and Media Relations – ESG.” The documents and materials published there highlight our ongoing ESG\ninitiatives. The information included in, referenced to, or otherwise accessible through our website, is not incorporated\n9\nby reference in, or considered to be part of, this Report on Form 10-K or any document unless expressly incorporated\nby reference therein.\nGovernmental Regulations\nWe must comply with various federal, state and local regulations, including regulations relating to consumer\nproducts and consumer protection, advertising and marketing, labor and employment, data protection and privacy,\nintellectual property, the environment and taxes. In addition, we must comply with United States customs laws and\nsimilar laws of other countries associated with the import of our merchandise. Ensuring our compliance with these\nvarious laws and regulations, and keeping abreast of changes to the legal and regulatory landscape present in our\nindustry, requires us to expend considerable resources. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors under\nthe sub-caption “Risks Related to New Legislation, Regulation, and Litigation.”\nSeasonality\nWe have historically experienced, and expect to continue to experience, substantial seasonal fluctuations in our\nnet sales and operating results. We believe this is the general pattern typical of our segment of the retail industry and\nexpect that this pattern will continue in the future. Due to the importance of the fall selling season, which includes\nThanksgiving and Christmas, the last quarter of our fiscal year has historically contributed, and is expected to continue\nto contribute, a disproportionate amount of our net sales, net income and cash flow for the entire fiscal year.\nAvailability of SEC Reports\nWe file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K with the\nSecurities Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information\nstatements and other information regarding issuers, including Kirkland’s, that file electronically with the SEC. The\naddress of that site is http://www.sec.gov.\nOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments\nto those documents filed by us with the SEC are available, without charge, on our internet website,\nwww.kirklands.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed electronically with the SEC. The\ninformation provided on our website is not part of this report, and is therefore not incorporated by reference unless\nsuch information is otherwise specifically referenced elsewhere in this report.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nThe following list describes our executive officers including their name, age and principal occupations and\nemployment during at least the past five years:\nAmy E. Sullivan, 45, was promoted to President, Chief Executive Officer and Director in February 2024.

Before her time with\nAeropostale, Ms. Joyce was the Vice President of Global Applications for Polo Ralph Lauren and prior to that she\nwas Director of Strategic Systems for Garan, Inc., a privately-owned manufacturer of casual clothing.\nNo family relationships exist among any of the above-listed executive officers, and there are no arrangements\nor understandings between any of the above-listed officers and any other person pursuant to which they serve as an\nofficer. All executive officers are elected to hold office for one year or until their successors are elected and qualified.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the\nother information contained in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the SEC, including\nour consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes before investing in our common stock. Any of the\nfollowing risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or\nliquidity. These risks are not the only risks we face. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity\ncould also be adversely affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally or by risks not currently\nknown to us or that we currently view to be immaterial. We can provide no assurance and make no representation\nthat our risk mitigation efforts, although we believe they are reasonable, will be successful.\nRisks Related to Liquidity\nInsufficient cash flows from operations could result in the substantial utilization of our secured revolving credit\nfacility and our term loan credit agreement, or similar financing, which may limit our ability to conduct certain\nactivities.\nWe are dependent upon generating sufficient cash flows from operations to fund our obligations and strategic\ninvestments. We maintain a secured revolving credit facility and a term loan credit agreement to enable us to acquire\nmerchandise, to fund working capital requirements and to support standby letters of credit. Borrowings under the\nsecured revolving credit facility and term loan credit agreement are subject to a borrowing base calculation consisting\nof a percentage of certain of our eligible assets and are subject to advance rates and commercially reasonable reserves.\nSubstantial utilization of the available borrowing base will result in various restrictions, including restrictions on the\nability to repurchase our common stock or pay dividends and an increase in the lender’s control over the Company’s\ncash accounts. Our revolving credit facility and term loan credit agreement contain a number of affirmative and\nrestrictive covenants that may also limit our actions. Continued negative cash flows from operations could result in\nincreased borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan credit agreement to fund operational needs,\nincreased utilization of letters of credit and greater dependence on the availability of the revolving credit facility and\nterm loan credit agreement. These actions could result in us being subject to increased restrictions, incurring increased\ninterest expense and increasing our leverage. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 4 –\nCredit Agreements” for additional discussion.\nWe could be required to refinance our debt before it matures and there is no assurance that we will be able to\nrefinance our debt on acceptable terms.\nOur ability to refinance each of our agreements governing our indebtedness on acceptable terms will be\ndependent upon a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our assets, borrowing restrictions\nwhich may be imposed by lenders and conditions in the credit markets at the time we refinance. Rising interest rates\nmay make future refinancing more difficult to obtain on favorable terms. In addition, although we have previously\nbeen successful in negotiating amendments to our revolving credit agreement and in securing our new term loan, we\nmay be unsuccessful in negotiating any further amendments or modifications to the agreements governing our\nindebtedness as we may deem necessary. To the extent we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms, we\nmay be forced to choose from a number of unfavorable options, including agreeing to otherwise unfavorable financing\nterms or defaulting and allowing our lenders to foreclose. Any one of these options could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our\nstockholders.\n11\nTo service our debt and pay other obligations, we will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be\navailable to us.\nOur ability to make payments on, repay or refinance our debt and any future debt we may incur, and to fund\nplanned capital expenditures will depend largely upon our future operating performance and our ability to generate\ncash from operations. Our future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial,\ncompetitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, our ability to borrow\nfunds in the future to make payments on our debt and other obligations will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants\nand financial ratios in our secured revolving credit facility and our other debt agreements, including other agreements\nwe may enter into in the future. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or we may not\nhave future borrowings available to us under our credit facility or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable\nus to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nIf we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, we may not be able to implement our strategic initiatives\nand fund our obligations.\nThe ability to execute our strategic initiatives, including our financial turnaround strategy, will depend on, among\nother factors, the availability of adequate capital, which in turn will depend in large part on cash flow generated by\nour business and the availability of equity and debt capital. The cost of improving our omni-channel capabilities\nincluding increasing our online sales capabilities, closing or relocating under-performing stores, remodeling existing\nstores and opening new stores will increase in the future compared to historical costs. There can be no assurance that\nour business will generate adequate cash flow or that we will be able to obtain equity or debt capital on acceptable\nterms, or at all. Moreover, our revolving credit facility and our term loan credit agreement contain provisions that\nrestrict the amount of debt we may incur in the future. If we are not successful in obtaining sufficient capital, we may\nbe unable to increase sales generated online and in stores, which may adversely affect our business strategy. There\ncan be no assurances that we will have sufficient cash flow from operations or adequate capital to achieve our plans\nfor omni-channel growth including growing in-store and online sales.\nRisks Related to Strategy and Strategy Execution\nIf we fail to identify, develop and successfully implement our short-term and long-term strategic initiatives, our\nfinancial performance could be negatively impacted.\nOur ability to execute our brand strategy and to deliver improved financial performance is dependent on\nsuccessfully identifying, developing and implementing plans and initiatives intended to drive sustainable, increased\nfinancial performance, including, but not limited to, our efforts to maintain existing and acquire new customers who\nfit our traditional customer profile, reintroduce more seasonal and impulse items with lower price points to attract\nprice conscious customers, increase our brand recognition, elevate our customer experience and invest in technology\nimprovements. If such plans and initiatives are not properly identified, developed and successfully executed, or if\nexecution or realization of positive results takes longer than expected, our financial condition and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected. The success of our plans and initiatives is subject to risks and uncertainties with respect\nto execution, market conditions and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ\nmaterially, and adversely, from our plans and expected results.\nIf we are unable to successfully maintain, improve and grow a best-in-class omni-channel experience for our\ncustomers, it could adversely affect our sales, results of operations and reputation.\nAs consumers continue to migrate online, we face pressures to stay relevant in retail’s ever-changing\nenvironment and to compete with other omni-channel retailers, online-only retailers and retailers with only stores. We\ncontinue to invest in our omni-channel capabilities to provide a seamless and engaging shopping experience between\nour store locations and our online and mobile environments. Insufficient, untimely or misguided investments in this\narea could significantly impact our profitability and growth and affect our ability to attract new customers, as well as\nmaintain our existing ones. In addition, declining customer store traffic and migration of sales from stores to digital\nplatforms could enhance these risks due to increased reliance on our omni-channel capabilities and could lead to\nrestructuring and other costs that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business has evolved from an in-store experience to interactions with customers across multiple channels\nincluding in-store, online, mobile and social media, among others. Our customers are using computers, tablets, mobile\nphones and other devices to shop on our website and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of\n12\nour business. Omni-channel retailing is rapidly evolving, and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations\nand new developments and technology investments by our competitors.\nSuccessful operation of our e-commerce initiatives are dependent on our ability to maintain uninterrupted\navailability of the Company’s website and supporting applications, adequate and accurate inventory levels, timely\nfulfillment of customer orders, accurate shipping of undamaged products, and coordination of those activities within\nour stores when appropriate. Maintenance of our website requires substantial development and maintenance efforts,\nand entails significant technical and business risks. To remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve\nthe responsiveness, functionality and features of our website. The sale of products through e-commerce is\ncharacterized by rapid technological change, the emergence of new industry standards and practices and changes in\ncustomer requirements and preferences. Therefore, we may be required to license emerging technologies, enhance our\nexisting website, develop new services and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of\nour current and prospective customers, and adapt to technological advances and emerging industry and regulatory\nstandards and practices in a cost-effective and timely manner. Our ability to remain technologically competitive may\nrequire substantial expenditures and lead time, and our failure to do so may harm our business and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain technical employees or contract with third parties having the specialized\nskills needed to support our omni-channel efforts, we might not be able to implement improvements to our customer-\nfacing technology in a timely manner or provide a convenient and consistent experience for our customers, which\ncould negatively affect our operations. In addition, if www.kirklands.com and our other customer-facing technology\nsystems do not appeal to our customers or reliably function as designed, we may experience a loss of customer\nconfidence, loss of sales or be exposed to fraudulent purchases, which, if significant, could adversely affect our\nreputation and results of operations. Moreover, to make available our omni-channel platform, we rely on various\ntechnology systems and services, some of which are provided and managed by third-party service providers. To the\nextent such third-party components do not perform or function as anticipated, such failure can significantly interfere\nin our ability to meet our customers’ changing expectations.\nIf we are unable to profitably operate our existing stores, we may not be able to execute our business strategy,\nresulting in a decrease in net sales and profitability.\nA key element of our strategy is to operate profitable stores, both in existing markets and in new geographic\nmarkets that we select based on customer data and demographics. Our ability to relocate under-performing stores\ndepends on a number of factors, including the prevailing conditions in the commercial real estate market, our ability\nto locate favorable store sites and negotiate acceptable lease terms, and hire and train skilled managers and personnel.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to relocate and/or open stores. Furthermore, there is no assurance that\nexisting stores will generate the net sales levels necessary to achieve store-level profitability. Also, any stores that we\nopen in our existing markets may draw customers away from our existing stores, resulting in lower net sales growth\ncompared to stores opened in new markets.\nOur stores face great competition and could have lower than anticipated net sales volumes. Traffic decline to our\nstores could negatively impact operating results. Stores located in areas where we are less well-known, and where we\nare less familiar with the target customer, may face different or additional risks and increased marketing and other\ncosts compared to stores operated in well-established existing markets. These factors may reduce our average store\ncontribution and operating margins. If we are unable to profitability operate our existing stores and relocate under-\nperforming stores, our net income could suffer.\nEvery year we decide to close certain stores based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, excessive\nrent or other operating cost increases, inadequate profitability, short term leases, or the landlord’s ability to replace us\nwith another tenant at more favorable terms to the landlord. Store closings have the effect of reducing net sales. We\nmay choose to close under-performing stores before lease expiration and incur termination costs associated with those\nclosings. If we are not able to increase online sales at a pace that exceeds the closing of existing under-performing\nstores, or transfer customers from closing stores to a nearby existing store, our revenue could decrease.\nIf our store strategy, including negotiating lease occupancy costs with landlords, does not go as planned and/or\nwe are unable to transfer these existing store customers to other nearby stores or to online sales, our revenue could\ndecrease and results of operations could suffer.\n13\nWe may not be able to successfully anticipate consumer trends, and our failure to do so may lead to loss of consumer\nacceptance of our products, resulting in reduced net sales, higher inventory and higher inventory markdowns.\nOur success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing merchandise trends and consumer\ndemands in a timely manner. While we devote considerable effort and resources to shape, analyze and respond to\nconsumer preferences, consumer spending patterns and preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and can change\nrapidly. Our product introductions and product improvements, along with our other marketplace initiatives, are\ndesigned to capitalize on consumer trends. In order to remain successful, we must anticipate and react to these trends\nand develop new products or processes to address them. If we fail to identify and respond to emerging trends, consumer\nacceptance of the merchandise in our stores and our image with our customers may be harmed, which could reduce\ncustomer traffic in our stores and materially adversely affect our net sales.\nAdditionally, if we misjudge market trends, we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced\nto take significant inventory markdowns, which would have a negative impact on our gross profit and cash flow.\nConversely, shortages of items that prove popular could result in missed sales. In addition, a major shift in consumer\ndemand away from home décor could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nOur success depends upon our marketing, advertising and promotional efforts, and customer loyalty programs. If\nwe are unable to implement them successfully, or if our competitors market, advertise or promote more effectively\nthan we do, our revenue may be adversely affected.\nWe use marketing, promotional and loyalty programs to attract customers to our stores and to encourage\npurchases by our customers online. We use various media for our promotional efforts, including customer-targeted\ndirect mail and email communications, as well as various digital and social media initiatives. If we fail to choose the\nappropriate medium for our efforts, or fail to implement and execute loyalty programs or marketing opportunities, our\ncompetitors may be able to attract some of our customers.\nIf our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions, if our advertising, media or marketing\nexpenses increase, if our loyalty program or advertising and promotions become less effective than those of our\ncompetitors, or if we do not adequately leverage technology and data analytic capabilities needed to generate concise\ncompetitive insight, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations. A failure to sufficiently\ninnovate, develop customer loyalty programs, or maintain adequate and effective advertising could inhibit our ability\nto maintain brand relevance and drive increased sales.\nOur loyalty program offers customer incentives, which include earning points that are converted to reward\ndollars that can be redeemed on future purchases, in addition to other bonus offers. If our customers do not respond\npositively to this program or if the program costs more than anticipated in reward redemptions, our financial results\ncould be adversely impacted.\nRisks Related to Competition\nWe face an extremely competitive specialty retail business market, and such competition could result in a reduction\nof our prices and a loss of our market share.\nThe retail market is a highly competitive market. Accordingly, we compete against a diverse group of retailers,\nincluding specialty stores, department stores, discount stores, and catalog and internet-based retailers, which sell\nsimilar lines of merchandise to those carried by us. The substantial sales growth in the e-commerce industry within\nthe last decade has encouraged the entry of many new competitors, including discount retailers selling similar products\nat reduced prices, new business models, and an increase in competition from established companies, many of whom\nare willing to spend significant funds and/or reduce pricing in order to gain market share. Our competitors, many of\nwhich are larger and have substantially greater financial and other resources than us, include HomeGoods,\nHomeSense, Walmart, World Market, Crate & Barrel, Williams-Sonoma, Inc., Hobby Lobby, At Home, Target, Ebay,\nAmazon and Wayfair. Our stores and our www.kirklands.com website also compete with the ever-increasing number\nof internet retail websites offering home décor merchandise. The availability of home décor merchandise from various\ncompetitors on the internet could result in increased price competition as our customers are more readily able to\ncomparison shop, which could reduce our sales, prices and margins and adversely affect our results of operations.\n14\nFurther, unanticipated changes in pricing or other practices of our competitors, including promotional activity, such\nas thresholds for free shipping and rapid price fluctuation enabled by technology, may adversely affect our\nperformance.\nSeveral of our competitors have greater financial, distribution, logistics, marketing and other resources available\nto them, and they may also be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly, devote greater\nresources to the design, sourcing, distribution, marketing and sale of their products, generate greater national brand\nrecognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Our competitors may also be able to increase sales in their new\nand existing markets faster than we do by emphasizing different distribution channels than we do.\nIf we are unable to overcome these potential competitive disadvantages, such factors could have an adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Reputation\nOur results could be negatively impacted if our merchandise offering suffers a substantial impediment to its\nreputation due to real or perceived quality issues.\nMaintaining, promoting and growing our merchandise offering will depend largely on the success of our design,\nmerchandising, and marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high-quality customer experience. If we\nfail to achieve these objectives, our public image and reputation could be tarnished by negative publicity.\nIf our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or customer expectations regarding safety,\nwe could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk. All of our vendors\nmust comply with applicable product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy\ncomply with all safety standards. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns with\nrespect to our products could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly\nproduct recalls and other liabilities. In addition, negative customer perceptions regarding the safety of the products we\nsell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs, resulting in lost sales. In those circumstances,\nit may be difficult and costly for us to regain customer confidence.\nIf we fail to maintain a positive social media brand perception, it could have a negative impact on our operations,\nfinancial results and reputation.\nMaintaining a good reputation is critical to our business. Social media has increased the risk that our reputation\ncould be negatively impacted in a short amount of time. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to\noccurrences of negative publicity through social media or otherwise, we may suffer declines in customer loyalty and\ntraffic, vendor relationship issues, diversion of management’s time to respond and other adverse effects, all of which\ncould negatively impact our operations, financial results and reputation.\nIf we fail to protect our brand name, competitors may adopt trade names that dilute the value of our brand name.\nWe may be unable or unwilling to strictly enforce our trademarks in each jurisdiction in which we do business.\nAlso, we may not always be able to successfully enforce our trademarks against competitors or against challenges by\nothers. Our failure to successfully protect our trademarks could diminish the value and efficacy of our brand\nrecognition, harm our rebranding efforts and could cause customer confusion, which could, in turn, adversely affect\nour sales and profitability.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by corporate citizenship and sustainability matters.\nThere is an increased focus from U.S. and foreign governmental and nongovernmental authorities and from\ncertain investors, customers, consumers, employees, and other stakeholders concerning corporate citizenship and\nsustainability matters. From time to time, we announce certain initiatives, including goals regarding our focus areas,\nwhich include environmental matters, packaging and waste, responsible sourcing, social investments and inclusion\nand diversity. We could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could fail\nin accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives and goals. Such failures could be due to changes in our business.\n15\nMoreover, the standards by which citizenship and sustainability efforts and related matters are measured are\ndeveloping and evolving, and certain areas are subject to assumptions, which could change over time. In addition, as\nthe result of such heightened public focus on sustainability matters, we may face increased pressure to provide\nexpanded disclosure, make or expand commitments, set targets, or establish additional goals and take actions to meet\nsuch goals, in connection with such matters. We could also be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals or\nperceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters. Any such matters, or related corporate citizenship\nand sustainability matters, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial\ncondition.\nRisks Related to New Legislation, Regulation and Litigation\nExisting and new legal requirements could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations. We routinely incur costs in\ncomplying with these laws and regulations. We are exposed to the risk that federal, state or local legislation may\nnegatively impact our operations. Changes in product regulations (including changes in labeling or disclosure\nrequirements), federal or state wage requirements including minimum wage requirements, employee rights (including\nchanges in the process for our employees to join a union), health care, social welfare or entitlement programs such as\nhealth insurance, paid leave programs, or other changes in workplace regulation or tax laws could adversely impact\nour ability to achieve our financial targets. Changes in other regulatory areas, such as consumer credit, privacy and\ninformation security, or environmental regulation may result in significant added expenses or may require extensive\nsystem and operating changes that may be difficult to implement and/or could materially increase our costs of doing\nbusiness. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations may subject us to legal risk,\nincluding government enforcement action, significant fines and penalties and class action litigation, as well as\nreputational damage, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nGreenhouse gases (“GHG”) may have an adverse effect on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the\nfrequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Global climate change could result in certain types\nof natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events could make it difficult or\nimpossible for us to deliver products to our customers by creating delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain.\nFollowing an interruption to our business, we could require substantial recovery time, experience significant\nexpenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Further, concern over climate change, including global\nwarming, has led to, and we expect will continue to lead to, legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting\nGHG emissions around the world. If domestic or international laws or regulations were expanded to require GHG\nemission reporting or reduction by us or our third-party manufacturers, or if we engage third-party contract\nmanufacturers in countries that have existing GHG emission reporting or reduction laws or regulations, we would\nneed to expend financial and other resources to comply with such regulations and/or to monitor our third-party\nmanufacturers’ compliance with such regulations. In addition, we cannot control the actions of our third-party\nmanufacturers or the public’s perceptions of them, nor can we assure that these manufacturers will conduct their\nbusinesses using climate change proactive or sustainable practices. Violations of climate change laws or regulations\nby third parties with whom we do business could result in negative public perception of us and/or delays in shipments\nand receipt of goods and could subject us to fines or other penalties, any of which could restrict our business activities,\nincrease our operating expenses or cause our sales to decline.\nAdditionally, our products are subject to regulation of and regulatory standards set by various governmental\nauthorities with respect to quality and safety. These regulations and standards may change from time to time. Our\ninability to comply on a timely basis with regulatory requirements could result in significant fines or penalties, which\ncould adversely affect our reputation and sales. Issues with the quality and safety of merchandise we sell, regardless\nof our culpability, or customer concerns about such issues, could result in damage to our reputation, lost sales,\nuninsured product liability claims or losses, merchandise recalls and increased costs.\nThe costs and other effects of new legal requirements or changes in existing legal requirements cannot be\ndetermined with certainty. Additional laws may directly or indirectly affect our production, distribution, packaging,\ncost of raw materials or fuel, any of which could impact our business and financial results. In addition, our efforts to\ncomply with existing or new legislation or regulations may increase our costs.\n16\nOur business could suffer if a manufacturer fails to use acceptable labor and environmental practices.\nWe do not control our vendors or the manufacturers that produce the products we buy from them, nor do we\ncontrol the labor and environmental practices of our vendors and these manufacturers. The violation of labor, safety,\nenvironmental and/or other laws and standards by any of our vendors or these manufacturers, or the divergence of the\nlabor and environmental practices followed by any of our vendors or these manufacturers from those generally\naccepted as ethical in the United States, could interrupt, or otherwise disrupt, the shipment of finished products to us\nor damage our reputation. Any of these, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial\ncondition and results of operations. In that regard, most of the products we sell are manufactured overseas, primarily\nin China, which may increase the risk that the labor and environmental practices followed by the manufacturers of\nthese products may differ from those considered acceptable in the United States.\nProduct liability claims could adversely affect our reputation.\nDespite our best efforts to ensure the quality and safety of the products we sell, we may be subject to product\nliability claims from customers or penalties from government agencies relating to allegations that the products sold\nby us are misbranded, contain contaminants or impermissible ingredients, provide inadequate instructions regarding\ntheir use or misuse, or include inadequate warnings concerning flammability or interactions with other substances.\nSuch claims may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including\nthe presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing,\nstorage, handling and transportation phases. All of our vendors and their products must comply with applicable product\nand safety laws. We generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our suppliers. However,\nif we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available, such claims could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. Our ability to obtain indemnification from\nforeign suppliers may be hindered by the manufacturer’s lack of understanding of United States product liability or\nother laws, which may make it more likely that we be required to respond to claims or complaints from customers as\nif we were the manufacturer of the products. Even with adequate insurance and indemnification, such claims could\nsignificantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in our products. Our litigation expenses could increase\nas well, which also could have a materially negative impact on our results of operations even if a product liability\nclaim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued.\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, consumers, vendors, competitors, intellectual\nproperty rights holders, shareholders, government agencies and others through private actions, class actions,\nadministrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation means. The outcome of litigation, particularly class\naction lawsuits, regulatory actions and intellectual property claims, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these\ntypes of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss\nrelating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, certain of these lawsuits,\nif decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our consolidated financial statements as\na whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required. The cost to\ndefend future litigation may be significant. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could\nnegatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we\nare ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of\noperations or liquidity.\nRisks Associated with Vendors and Distribution\nWe are dependent on foreign imports for a significant portion of our merchandise, and any changes in the trading\nrelations and conditions between the United States and the relevant foreign countries may lead to a decline in\ninventory resulting in a decline in net sales, or an increase in the cost of sales resulting in reduced gross profit.\nIn fiscal 2023, approximately 53% of our merchandise was purchased through vendors in the United States who\neither import merchandise from foreign countries or contract with domestic manufacturers, while approximately 47%\nof our merchandise was directly sourced by us from factories in foreign countries. We are subject to the risks involved\nwith relying on products manufactured abroad, particularly to the extent that their effects are passed through to us by\nour vendors or that those risks directly apply to us. These risks include changes in import duties, quotas, loss of “most\n17\nfavored nation” trading status with the United States for a particular foreign country, work stoppages, delays in\nshipments, first cost price increases, freight cost increases, exchange rate fluctuations, terrorism, public health crises,\nwar, economic uncertainties (including inflation, foreign government regulations and political unrest), trade\nrestrictions (including the United States imposing anti-dumping or countervailing duty orders, safeguards, remedies\nor compensation and retaliation due to illegal foreign trade practices) and other factors relating to foreign trade,\nincluding costs and uncertainties associated with efforts to identify and disclose sources of “conflict minerals” used\nin products that we cause to be manufactured and potential sell-through difficulties and reputational damage that may\nbe associated with our inability to determine that such products are classified as “DRC conflict-free.” If any of these\nor other factors were to cause a disruption of trade, from the countries in which the suppliers of our vendors or our\ndirect suppliers are located, our inventory levels may be reduced or the cost of our products may increase.\nWe cannot predict the effect that future changes in economic or political conditions in foreign countries may\nhave on our operations. Although we believe that we could access alternative sources in the event of disruptions or\ndelays in supply due to economic, political or health conditions in foreign countries, such disruptions or delays may\nadversely affect our results of operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements can be made. In addition,\nmerchandise purchased from alternative sources may be of lesser quality or more expensive than the merchandise we\ncurrently purchase abroad.\nCountries from which we or our vendors obtain these products may, from time to time, impose new or adjust\nprevailing quotas or other restrictions on exported products, and the United States may impose new duties, quotas and\nother restrictions on imported products. This could disrupt the supply of such products to us and adversely affect our\noperations. The United States Congress periodically considers other restrictions on the importation of products\nobtained for us. The cost of such products may increase for us if applicable duties are raised or import quotas with\nrespect to such products are imposed or made more restrictive.\nApproximately 73% of our fiscal 2023 merchandise purchases are products manufactured in China. We have\ndeveloped strategies to try to mitigate the impact of current and potential future tariffs, including collaborative efforts\nwith our vendor partners and raising retail prices. There can be no assurance that the imposed tariffs will not be\nincreased, expanded or extended, or that the issues that led the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to impose the\ntariffs will be resolved. The impact of these tariffs on current and future fiscal years could have a material adverse\neffect on our cost of goods sold and results of operations.\nWe depend on a number of vendors to supply our merchandise, and any delay in merchandise deliveries from\ncertain vendors may lead to a decline in inventory, which could result in a loss of net sales.\nAny disruption in the supply or increase in pricing of our merchandise could negatively impact our ability to\nachieve anticipated operating results. We purchase our products from approximately 180 vendors with which we have\nno long-term purchase commitments or exclusivity contracts. We have a core group of approximately 80 vendors that\nprovide approximately 90% of our merchandise. No vendor provides over 10% of our merchandise purchases. Any\ndisruption in the relationship with our core vendors could negatively impact our ability to achieve anticipated operating\nresults.\nHistorically, we have retained our vendors, and we have generally not experienced difficulty in obtaining desired\nmerchandise from vendors on acceptable terms. However, our arrangements with these vendors do not guarantee the\navailability of merchandise, establish guaranteed prices or provide for the continuation of particular pricing practices.\nOur current vendors may not continue to sell products to us on current terms or at all, and we may not be able to\nestablish relationships with new vendors to ensure delivery of products in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to\nus. In addition, a period of unfavorable financial performance may make it difficult for some of our vendors to arrange\nfor the financing or factoring of their orders with manufacturers, which could result in our inability to obtain desired\nmerchandise from those vendors.\nWe may not be able to acquire desired merchandise in sufficient quantities on terms acceptable to us in the\nfuture. Also, our business would be adversely affected if there were delays in product shipments to us due to shipping\ndifficulties, strikes or other difficulties at our principal transport providers or otherwise. We have from time to time\nexperienced delays of this nature. We are also dependent on vendors for assuring the quality of merchandise supplied\nto us. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise in the future or the loss of one or more of our vendors and our\nfailure to replace any one or more of them may harm our relationship with our customers resulting in a loss of net\nsales.\n18\nOur success is highly dependent on our planning and control processes and our supply chain, and any disruption\nin or failure to continue to improve these processes may result in a loss of net sales and net income.\nAn important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies, cost reductions and net sales growth is the continued\nidentification and implementation of improvements to our planning, logistical and distribution infrastructure and our\nsupply chain, including merchandise ordering, transportation and receipt processing. In addition, recent increases in\nenergy prices have resulted, and are expected to continue to result, in increased merchandise and freight costs, which\ncannot readily be offset through higher prices because of competitive factors.\nThe distribution of products to our stores and directly to our customers is coordinated through our third-party\nwest coast bypass operation, our distribution facility in Jackson, Tennessee and our third-party distribution center in\nLancaster, Texas. We depend on the orderly operation of these receiving and distribution facilities, which rely on\nadherence to shipping schedules and effective management. In 2023, we closed our North Las Vegas, Nevada and\nWinchester, Virginia e-commerce order fulfillment centers to reduce fixed costs and consolidate our operations.\nWe make significant upgrades to our warehouse management software. If these changes or upgrades do not go\nsmoothly or timely, then we could face significant disruptions with our distribution process and incur excess costs\nrelated to the upgrades.\nIn addition, we cannot assure that events beyond our control, such as disruptions due to fire or other catastrophic\nevents, adverse weather conditions, labor disagreements or shipping problems, will not result in delays in the delivery\nof merchandise to our stores or directly to our customers. We also cannot guarantee that our insurance will be\nsufficient, or that insurance proceeds will be timely paid to us, in the event that any of our distribution facilities are\nshut down for any reason.\nAny significant disruption in the operations of our distribution facilities would have a material adverse effect on\nour ability to maintain proper inventory levels in our stores and satisfy our online orders, which could result in a loss\nof net sales and net income.\nOur freight costs and thus our cost of goods sold are impacted by changes in fuel prices.\nOur freight cost is impacted by changes in fuel prices through surcharges. Fuel prices and surcharges affect\nfreight costs with respect to both inbound freight from vendors to our distribution centers and outbound freight from\nour distribution centers to our stores. Increased fuel prices or surcharges may increase freight costs and thereby\nincrease our cost of goods sold.\nRisks Related to Technology and Data Security\nFailure to protect the integrity and security of individually identifiable data of our customers and employees could\nexpose us to litigation and damage our reputation; the expansion of our e-commerce business has inherent\ncybersecurity risks that may result in business disruptions.\nWe receive and maintain certain personal information about our customers and employees in the ordinary course\nof business. Our use of this information is regulated at the international, federal and state levels, as well as by certain\nthird parties with whom we contract for such services. If our security and information systems are compromised or\nour business associates fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized\npersons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect our reputation, as well as operations, results of operations,\nand financial condition and could result in litigation or the imposition of penalties. As privacy and information security\nlaws and regulations change, we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance. Our business requires\ncollection of large volumes of internal and customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally\nidentifiable information of our customers in various information systems and those of our service providers. The\nintegrity and protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to us. If that data is inaccurate or\nincomplete, we or the store employees could make faulty decisions. Customers and employees also have a high\nexpectation that we and our service providers will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory\nenvironment surrounding information, security and privacy is also increasingly demanding. Our existing systems may\nbe unable to satisfy changing regulatory requirements and employee and customer expectations, or may require\nsignificant additional investments or time to do so. Despite implementation of various measures designed to protect\nour information systems and records, including those we maintain with our service providers, we may be subject to\n19\nsecurity breaches, system failures, viruses, operator error or inadvertent releases of data. A significant theft, loss, or\nfraudulent use of customer, employee, or company data maintained by us or by a service provider or failure to comply\nwith the various United States and international laws and regulations applicable to the protection of such data or with\nPayment Card Industry data security standards could adversely impact our reputation and could result in remedial and\nother expenses, fines, or litigation. A breach in the security of our information systems or those of our service providers\ncould lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems, resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits.\nCertain aspects of the business, particularly our website, heavily depend on consumers entrusting personal\nfinancial information to be transmitted securely over public networks, which increases our exposure to cybersecurity\nrisks. We invest considerable resources in protecting the personal information of our customers but are still subject to\nthe risks of security breaches and cyber incidents resulting in unauthorized access to stored personal information. Any\nbreach of our cybersecurity measures could result in violation of privacy laws, potential litigation, and a loss of\nconfidence in our security measures, all of which could have a negative impact on our financial results and our\nreputation. In addition, a privacy breach or other type of cybercrime or cybersecurity attack could cause us to incur\nsignificant costs to restore the integrity of our system, could require the devotion of significant management resources,\nand could result in significant costs in government penalties and private litigation.\nOur information technology is vulnerable to obsolescence, interruption and damage that could harm our business.\nWe rely upon our existing information systems for operating and monitoring all major aspects of our business,\nincluding sales, warehousing, distribution, purchasing, inventory control, merchandise planning and replenishment,\nas well as various financial functions. These systems and our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from\nfire, flood and other natural disasters, power loss, computer systems failures, internet and telecommunications or data\nnetwork failures, operator negligence, improper operation by or supervision of employees, physical and electronic\nloss of data, misappropriation, computer viruses, malicious attacks and security breaches.\nAny disruption in the operation of our information technology, the loss of employees knowledgeable about such\nsystems or our failure to continue to effectively modify such systems could interrupt our operations or interfere with\nour ability to monitor inventory or process customer transactions, which could result in reduced net sales and affect\nour operations and financial performance. We also need to ensure that our systems are consistently adequate to handle\nour anticipated growth and are upgraded, as necessary, to meet our needs. The cost of any such technology upgrades\nor enhancements could be significant. If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may incur substantial\ncosts to repair or replace them, and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to\nmanage inventories or process customer transactions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe also rely heavily on our information technology employees. Failure to meet these staffing needs may\nnegatively affect our ability to fulfill our technology initiatives, while impacting our ability to maintain our existing\nsystems. We rely on certain vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems. The software\nprograms supporting many of our systems were licensed to us by independent software developers. The inability of\nthese developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these systems and software programs could disrupt or\nreduce the efficiency of our operations if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely\nmanner. In addition, costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or\nupgraded systems and technology, or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems, could also disrupt or\nreduce the efficiency of our operations.\nRisks Related to Governance\nOur charter and bylaw provisions and certain provisions of Tennessee law may make it difficult in some respects\nto cause a change in control of Kirkland’s and replace incumbent management.\nOur charter authorizes the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock with such designations, rights and\npreferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, the Board of Directors\nis empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting\nor other rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common\nstock. Holders of our common stock do not have preemptive rights to subscribe for a pro rata portion of any capital\n20\nstock that may be issued by us. In the event of issuance, such preferred stock could be utilized, under certain\ncircumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of Kirkland’s.\nOur charter and bylaws contain certain corporate governance provisions that may make it more difficult to\nchallenge management, deter and inhibit unsolicited changes in control of Kirkland’s and have the effect of depriving\nour shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium over the prevailing market price of our common stock in the\nevent of an attempted hostile takeover. First, the charter provides for a classified Board of Directors, with directors\n(after the expiration of the terms of the initial classified board of directors) serving three-year terms from the year of\ntheir respective elections and being subject to removal only for cause and upon the vote of 80% of the voting power\nof all outstanding capital stock entitled to vote (the “Voting Power”). Second, our charter and bylaws do not generally\npermit shareholders to call, or require that the Board of Directors call, a special meeting of shareholders. The charter\nand bylaws also limit the business permitted to be conducted at any such special meeting. In addition, Tennessee law\npermits action to be taken by the shareholders by written consent only if the action is consented to by holders of the\nnumber of shares required to authorize shareholder action and if all shareholders entitled to vote are parties to the\nwritten consent. Third, the bylaws establish an advance notice procedure for shareholders to nominate candidates for\nelection as directors or to bring other business before meetings of the shareholders. Only those shareholder nominees\nwho are nominated in accordance with this procedure are eligible for election as directors of Kirkland’s, and only such\nshareholder proposals may be considered at a meeting of shareholders as have been presented to Kirkland’s in\naccordance with the procedure. Finally, the charter provides that the amendment or repeal of any of the foregoing\nprovisions of the charter mentioned previously in this paragraph requires the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the\nVoting Power. In addition, the bylaws provide that the amendment or repeal by shareholders of any bylaws made by\nour Board of Directors requires the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the Voting Power.\nFurthermore, Kirkland’s is subject to certain provisions of Tennessee law, including certain Tennessee corporate\ntakeover acts that are, or may be, applicable to us. These acts, which include the Investor Protection Act, the Business\nCombination Act and the Tennessee Greenmail Act, seek to limit the parameters in which certain business\ncombinations and share exchanges occur. The charter, bylaws and Tennessee law provisions may have an anti-\ntakeover effect, including possibly discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market\nprice for our common stock.\nRisks Related to Human Capital\nWe depend on key personnel, and, if we lose the services of any member of our senior management team, we may\nnot be able to run our business effectively.\nWe have benefited from the leadership and performance of our senior management team. Our success will\ndepend on our ability to retain our current senior management members and to attract and retain qualified personnel\nin the future. Competition for senior management personnel is intense, and there can be no assurances that we will be\nable to retain our personnel. Additionally, any failure by us to manage a successful leadership transition of an executive\nofficer and to timely identify a qualified permanent replacement could harm our business and have a material adverse\neffect on our results of operations. There can also be no assurance that a reduced or less qualified executive team can\nsuitably perform operational responsibilities.\nOur business depends upon hiring, training and retaining qualified employees.\nThe success of our strategic plans are dependent on our ability to promote and recruit a sufficient number of\nquality employees in our stores, distribution centers and corporate headquarters. Our workforce costs represent our\nlargest operating expense, and our business is subject to employment laws and regulations, including requirements\nrelated to minimum wage and benefits. In addition, the implementation of potential regulatory changes relating to\novertime exemptions and benefits for certain employees under federal and state laws could result in increased labor\ncosts to our business and negatively impact our operating results. We cannot be assured that we can continue to hire,\ntrain and retain qualified employees at current wage rates since we operate in a competitive labor market, and there is\na risk of market increases in compensation.\nThe success of our store strategy depends on our ability to hire, train and retain qualified district managers, store\nmanagers and sales associates to support our stores. In addition, the time and effort required to train and supervise a\n21\nlarge number of new managers and associates due to seasonal hiring practices or excessive turnover may divert\nresources from our existing stores and adversely affect our operating and financial performance.\nWe also depend on hiring qualified personnel at our distribution centers, especially during our peak season in\nthe third and fourth quarters leading up to the holiday selling season. Not being able to hire or find temporary qualified\nhelp during this season, could lead to bottlenecks in the supply chain and products not arriving timely in stores or\ndirectly to customer homes, which could negatively impact sales.\nLow unemployment rates in the United States, rising wages and competition for qualified talent could result in\nthe failure to attract, motivate and retain personnel. This has resulted in higher employee costs, increased attrition and\nsignificant shifts in the labor market and employee expectations. We may continue to face challenges in finding and\nretaining qualified personnel, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial\ncondition.\nRisks Related to Weather\nWeather conditions could adversely affect our sales and/or profitability by affecting consumer shopping patterns.\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by severe or unexpected weather conditions. Adverse weather\nconditions or other extreme changes in the weather, including resulting electrical and technological failures, may\ndisrupt our business and may adversely affect our ability to sell and distribute products. Frequent or unusual snow, ice\nor rain storms or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures in our markets could adversely affect our performance\nby affecting customer shopping patterns or diminishing demand for seasonal merchandise. For example, extended\nperiods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could\nreduce demand for a portion of our inventory and thereby reduce our sales and profitability.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomics\nWe are exposed to the risk of natural disasters, pandemic outbreaks, global political events, war and terrorism that\ncould disrupt our business and result in lower sales, increased operating costs and capital expenditures.\nOur headquarters, store locations, distribution centers and warehouses, as well as certain of our vendors and\ncustomers, are located in areas that have been and could be subject to natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes,\ntornadoes, fires or earthquakes. In addition, we operate in markets that may be susceptible to pandemic outbreaks\n(such as COVID-19), war, terrorist acts or disruptive global political events, such as civil unrest in countries in which\nour vendors are located or products are manufactured. Our business may be harmed if our ability to sell and distribute\nproducts is impacted by any such events, any of which could influence customer trends and purchases and may\nnegatively impact our net sales, properties or operations. Such events could result in physical damage to one or more\nof our properties, the temporary closure of some or all of our stores or distribution centers, the temporary lack of an\nadequate work force in a market, temporary or long-term disruption in the transport of goods, delay in the delivery of\ngoods to our distribution centers or stores, disruption of our technology support or information systems, or fuel\nshortages or dramatic increases in fuel prices and shipping costs, which increase the cost of doing business. These\nevents also can have indirect consequences such as increases in the costs of insurance if they result in significant loss\nof property or other insurable damage. Any of these factors, or a combination thereof, could adversely affect our\noperations.\nOur performance may be affected by general economic conditions.\nOur performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary\nconsumer spending. Some of the factors that have had, and may in the future have, an impact on discretionary\nconsumer spending include national or global economic downturns, an increase in consumer debt (and a corresponding\ndecrease in the availability of affordable consumer credit), reductions in net worth based on recent severe market\ndeclines, softness in the residential real estate and mortgage markets, changes in taxation, increases in fuel and energy\nprices, fluctuation in interest rates, low consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors.\nSpecialty retail is a cyclical industry that is heavily dependent upon the overall level of consumer spending.\nPurchases of home décor and furnishings tend to be highly correlated with cycles in consumers’ disposable income\nand trends in the housing market. A weak retail environment could impact customer traffic in our stores and also\n22\nadversely affect our net sales. Because of the seasonality of our business, economic downturns or increased sourcing\ncosts during the last quarter of our fiscal year could adversely affect us to a greater extent than if such downturns\noccurred at other times of the year. As purchases of home décor and furnishings may decline during recessionary\nperiods, a prolonged recession, including any related decrease in consumers’ disposable incomes, may have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nShould credit markets tighten or turmoil in the financial markets develop, our ability to access funds, refinance\nour existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of our\nsecurities would be adversely impacted.\nThe impact of any such credit crisis or market turmoil on our major suppliers cannot be accurately predicted.\nThe inability of key suppliers to access liquidity, or the insolvency of key suppliers, could lead to their failure to\ndeliver our merchandise. Worsening economic conditions could also result in difficulties for financial institutions\n(including bank failures) and other parties with whom we do business, which could potentially impair our ability to\naccess financing under existing arrangements or to otherwise recover amounts as they become due under our other\ncontractual arrangements.\nOur profitability is vulnerable to inflation and cost increases.\nFuture increases in costs such as the cost of merchandise, shipping rates, freight costs, fuel costs and store\noccupancy costs may reduce our profitability. These cost increases may be the result of inflationary pressures that\ncould further reduce our sales or profitability. Increases in other operating costs, including changes in energy prices,\nwage rates and lease and utility costs, may increase our cost of goods sold or operating expenses. Competitive\npressures in our industry may have the effect of inhibiting our ability to reflect these increased costs in the prices of\nour products and therefore reduce our profitability.\nThe market price for our common stock might be volatile and could result in a decline in the value of your\ninvestment.\nThe price at which our common stock trades has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile, and such\nvolatility could expose us to securities class action litigation. The market price of our common stock could be subject\nto significant fluctuations in response to our operating results, general trends and prospects for the retail industry,\nannouncements by our competitors, analyst recommendations, our ability to meet or exceed analysts’ or investors’\nexpectations, the condition of the financial markets and other factors. In addition, the stock market in recent years has\nexperienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating\nperformance of companies. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely\naffect the market price of our common stock, notwithstanding our actual operating performance.\nRisks Related to Business and Operations\nOur business is highly seasonal and our fourth quarter contributes to a disproportionate amount of our net sales,\nnet income and cash flow, and any factors negatively impacting us during our fourth quarter could reduce our net\nsales, net income and cash flow, leaving us with excess inventory and making it more difficult for us to finance our\ncapital requirements.\nWe have historically experienced, and expect to continue to experience, substantial seasonal fluctuations in our\nnet sales and operating results. We believe this is the general pattern typical of our segment of the retail industry and\nexpect that this pattern will continue in the future. Due to the importance of the fall selling season, which includes\nThanksgiving and Christmas, the last quarter of our fiscal year has historically contributed, and is expected to continue\nto contribute, a disproportionate amount of our net sales, net income and cash flow for the entire fiscal year. Any\nfactors negatively affecting us during the last quarter of our fiscal year, including unfavorable economic or weather\nconditions, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, reducing our cash\nflow, leaving us with excess inventory and making it more difficult for us to finance our capital requirements.\nOur quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors,\nincluding the timing of store closings and openings, customer traffic changes, shifts in the timing of certain holidays\n23\nand competition. Consequently, comparisons between quarters are not necessarily meaningful, and the results for any\nquarter are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nInventory loss and theft and the inability to anticipate inventory needs may result in reduced net sales.\nWe are subject to the risk of inventory loss and theft. We have experienced inventory shrinkage in the past, and\nwe cannot assure that incidences of inventory loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are\ntaking will effectively reduce the problem of inventory shrinkage. Although some level of inventory shrinkage is an\nunavoidable cost of doing business, if we were to experience higher rates of inventory shrinkage or incur increased\nsecurity costs to combat inventory theft, our financial condition could be affected adversely.\nEfficient inventory management is a key component of our business success and profitability. To be successful,\nwe must maintain sufficient inventory levels to meet our customers’ demands without allowing those levels to increase\nto such an extent that the costs to store and hold the goods unduly impacts our financial results. If our buying decisions\ndo not accurately predict customer trends or purchasing actions, we may have to take unanticipated markdowns to\ndispose of the excess inventory, which also can adversely impact our financial results. Though we attempt to reduce\nthese risks, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our inventory management, which may negatively\nimpact our cash flows and results of operations.\nFailure to control merchandise returns could negatively impact the business.\nWe have established a provision for estimated merchandise returns based upon historical experience and other\nknown factors. If actual returns are greater than those projected by management, additional reductions of revenue\ncould be recorded in the future. Also, to the extent that returned merchandise is damaged, we may not receive full\nretail value from the resale of the returned merchandise. Introductions of new merchandise, changes in merchandise\nmix, associate selling behavior, merchandise quality issues, changes to our return policy, e-commerce return behavior,\nchanges in consumer confidence, or other competitive and general economic conditions may cause actual returns to\nexceed the provision for estimated merchandise returns. An increase in merchandise returns that exceeds our current\nprovision could negatively impact the business and financial results.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nThe Company depends on the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information systems and data. We\nhave systems and processes in place to assess, identify and manage cybersecurity incidents and those systems and\nprocesses are integrated into our overall risk management system.\nInternal and third-party risks are reviewed, monitored and managed by the Company's IT ISC2, SANS,\nCompTIA certified security partners and external expert consultants. The Company annually engages third-party\nexperts to assess the effectiveness of system and network security. Periodically, an external independent consultancy\nteam conducts a comprehensive review of the Company's cybersecurity program using the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity Framework. Additionally, the Company is assessed annually by\nan independent third party for compliance with the PCI-DSS standard, for which the Company receives an attestation\nof compliance.\nThe Company’s security awareness program seeks to create a culture of shared responsibility for the security of\nsensitive data and systems. There is required annual security training and quarterly phishing campaigns for team\nmembers with access to Company email. Annually, members of the IT department are required to take IT specific\ntraining, and store employees take operations and security training. A third-party led social engineering campaign that\ntargets Kirkland’s employees is carried out on an annual basis. Key performance indicators and periodic testing of\ntraining materials ensure the program’s effectiveness.\nThe Company’s process for identifying and managing first and third-party risks from cybersecurity threats\nincludes proactive threat hunting, continuous monitoring of the Company’s systems and network for cybersecurity\n24\nevents, and regular testing of the Company’s Security Incident Response Plan, Business Continuity Plan, and Disaster\nRecovery Plan. An external managed security services provider and an industry-leading security tool continuously\nmonitors, detects, and responds to the Company’s systems and network for cybersecurity threats. The Company’s IT\nsecurity partners evaluate the escalated threats, and if necessary, take steps to contain and recover from pervasive\nthreats in accordance with the Company’s Security Incident Response Plan. A third-party with extensive experience\nin incident response and forensics is on retainer to assist with incidents. The Incident Response Plan includes reporting\nand escalation procedures to inform the Company’s executives, the Audit Committee, and full Board of Directors, as\nappropriate, to enable them to carry out their oversight responsibilities, and to ensure timely compliance with\napplicable reporting rules. The Company’s Incident Response Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan include procedures\nfor business recovery and are tested at least annually. The Company also maintains a cyber insurance policy that\nprovides coverage for material IT security incidents.\nNo risks from cybersecurity threats have materially affected, nor has the Company identified any specific risks\nfrom known cybersecurity threats that are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company, including our business\nstrategy, results of operations or financial condition. Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Technology\nand Data Security” for additional discussion of cybersecurity risks applicable to the Company.\nManagement Responsibilities\nOur cybersecurity program is managed by our Chief Technology Officer (“CTO”). Our CTO has 10 years of\nexperience in information technology and cybersecurity, having been at the Company since 2023. The CTO, along\nwith the Company’s IT security partners, is responsible for reducing cybersecurity risk by maintaining a proactive\nsecurity posture aligned with current threats, detecting cybersecurity events, responding quickly and building\nprocedures to rapidly recover, if needed.\nBoard Responsibilities\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee provides oversight of the Company’s management of\ncybersecurity risk. The Audit Committee quarterly reviews the Company’s cybersecurity risks, incidents, audits,\nassessments, crisis readiness, awareness activities and compliance with cybersecurity and privacy laws and\nregulations. The Company’s Chief Technology Officer briefs the Audit Committee quarterly on active and emerging\ncybersecurity threats and efforts to strengthen the Company’s defenses against these threats.\nItem 2. Properties\nWe lease all of our store locations and expect to continue our practice of leasing rather than owning stores. Our\nleases typically provide for five- to 10-year initial terms, many with the ability for us (or the landlord) to terminate the\nlease at specified points during the term if net sales at the leased premises do not reach a certain annual level. Many\nof our leases provide for payment of percentage rent (i.e., a percentage of net sales in excess of a specified level), and\nthe rate of increase in key ancillary charges is generally capped.\nAs current leases expire, we believe we have the option to obtain favorable lease renewals for present store\nlocations or obtain new leases for equivalent or better locations in the same general area. To date, we have not\nexperienced unusual difficulty in either renewing or extending leases for existing locations or securing leases for\nsuitable locations for new stores.\n25\nThe following table indicates the states where our stores are located and the number of stores within each state\nas of February 3, 2024:\nState Number of Stores State Number of Stores\nTexas 50 Mississippi 6\nFlorida 26 Oklahoma 6\nGeorgia 22 New Jersey 6\nNorth Carolina 19 Arkansas 5\nTennessee 18 Wisconsin 5\nCalifornia 17 Delaware 4\nAlabama 13 Kansas 4\nPennsylvania 12 Minnesota 4\nIndiana 11 Iowa 3\nIllinois 10 New York 3\nLouisiana 10 Maryland 2\nOhio 10 Colorado 2\nMichigan 10 North Dakota 2\nMissouri 10 Nebraska 2\nSouth Carolina 10 Nevada 2\nVirginia 9 West Virginia 1\nKentucky 8 South Dakota 1\nArizona 7 Total 330\nWe lease all of our distribution locations, and we lease additional overflow warehouse space as needed on a\nmonth-to-month basis. The following is a list of distribution locations including the approximate square footage as of\nFebruary 3, 2024:\nDistribution Facility Locations Type Approximate Square Footage\nJackson, Tennessee store and e-commerce fulfillment 771,000\nLancaster, Texas third-party operated store fulfillment 200,000\nWe closed our North Las Vegas, Nevada e-commerce fulfilment operation in March 2023 and our Winchester,\nVirginia e-commerce fulfillment operation in September 2023. We consolidated all e-commerce fulfilment into our\nJackson, Tennessee distribution facility.\nWe also lease approximately 49,000 square feet of office space in Brentwood, Tennessee.\nItem 3.

Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity\nSecurities\nOur common stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “KIRK”. We commenced trading on Nasdaq on July\n11, 2002. On March 18, 2024, there were approximately 31 holders of record and approximately 13,236 beneficial\nowners of our common stock.\n26\nDividend Policy\nThere have been no dividends declared on any class of our common stock since fiscal 2015. Our senior credit\nfacility and term loan credit agreement restrict our ability to pay cash dividends. See “Item 7. Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources” for\ndiscussion of our senior credit facility and our term loan credit agreement. Future cash dividends, if any, will be\ndetermined by our Board of Directors and will be based upon our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition,\ndebt covenants and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.\nIssuer Repurchases of Equity Securities\nOn January 6, 2022, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan\nproviding for the purchase in the aggregate of up to $30.0 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock.\nRepurchases of shares are made in accordance with applicable securities laws and may be made from time to time in\nthe open market or by negotiated transactions. The amount and timing of repurchases are based on a variety of factors,\nincluding stock price, regulatory limitations and other market and economic factors. The share repurchase plan does\nnot require us to repurchase any specific number of shares, and we may terminate the repurchase plan at any time. In\nfiscal 2023, we did not repurchase any shares of common stock under our share repurchase plan. As of February 3,\n2024, we had approximately $26.3 million remaining under the share repurchase plan.\nItem 6. Reserved\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to provide the reader with information that will assist in\nunderstanding the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity, and\ncapital resources during the two-year period ended February 3, 2024 (our fiscal years 2023 and 2022). Our fiscal year\nis comprised of the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. Accordingly, fiscal 2023\nrepresented the 53 weeks ended on February 3, 2024, and fiscal 2022 represented the 52 weeks ended on January 28,\n2023. For a comparison of our results of operations for the 52-week period ended January 28, 2023, compared to the\n52-week period ended January 29, 2022, see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023,\nfiled with the SEC on April 4, 2023. This discussion should be read with our consolidated financial statements and\nrelated notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nA number of the matters and subject areas discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations”, “Business” and elsewhere in this Form 10-K are not limited to historical or\ncurrent facts and deal with potential future circumstances and developments and are, accordingly, “forward-looking\nstatements.” You are cautioned that such forward-looking statements, which may be identified by words such as\n“anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “seek,” “may,” “could,” “strategy,” and similar\nexpressions, are only predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially.\nOverview\nWe are a specialty retailer of home décor and furnishings in the United States. As of February 3, 2024, we\noperated a total of 330 stores in 35 states as well as an e-commerce website, www.kirklands.com, under the Kirkland’s\nHome brand. We provide our customers with an engaging shopping experience characterized by a curated, affordable\nselection of home décor and furnishings along with inspirational design ideas. This combination of quality and stylish\nmerchandise, value pricing and a stimulating in-store and online environment provides our customers with a unique\nbrand experience.\n27\nExecutive Summary\nIn fiscal 2023, we closed 16 stores and relocated one store. In fiscal 2022, we opened one new store and closed\n16 stores. E-commerce sales, including shipping revenue, was 25.8% and 26.5% of net sales in fiscal 2023 and fiscal\n2022, respectively.\nOur net sales for fiscal 2023 decreased by 6.0% to $468.7 million from $498.8 million in fiscal 2022. The net\nsales decrease of $30.1 million in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to a consolidated comparable sales decrease of $23.1\nmillion and a non-comparable sales decrease of $13.6 million, primarily related to store closures, partially offset by\n$6.6 million in sales due to the extra week in fiscal 2023. Comparable sales decreased mainly due to a decrease in\ntraffic and average ticket in stores and online, partially offset by an increase in conversion. On a 52-week comparison,\nconsolidated comparable same-store sales, which includes e-commerce sales, decreased 4.8% for fiscal 2023. For\nfiscal 2023, gross profit increased 6.0% to $127.0 million from $119.8 million for fiscal 2022. Gross profit as a\npercentage of net sales improved 310 basis points to 27.1% of net sales for fiscal 2023 from 24.0% in fiscal 2022,\nwhich included approximately 270 basis points of improved merchandise margin, but a decline of $3.1 million in\nmerchandise margin dollars. We had an operating loss of $24.4 million in fiscal 2023 compared to an operating loss\nof $42.8 million in fiscal 2022, an improvement of $18.3 million, driven by the increase in gross profit dollars and\nlower operating costs. For fiscal 2023, net loss was $27.8 million, or $2.16 per diluted share, compared to a net loss\nof $44.7 million, or $3.52 per diluted share, in fiscal 2022.\nWe continue to monitor our liquidity position very closely as we focus on turning around our financial results\nby concentrating on our business strategy. We ended fiscal 2023 with $3.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and\n$34.0 million in outstanding debt. In fiscal 2023, we increased the capacity and extended the term of our existing\n$90.0 million asset-based credit facility through March 2028, and we entered into an additional $12.0 million asset-\nbased delay-draw term loan to provide additional liquidity. Both of these facilities are limited by a borrowing base\nformula, which consists of a percentage of eligible inventory and eligible credit card receivables, less reserves and an\nexcess required availability covenant, which limits the borrowing base formula by the greater of 10% of the combined\nborrowing base formula or $8.0 million. As of February 3, 2024, we had approximately $18.1 million available for\nborrowing under the agreements, after the minimum required excess availability covenant.\nKey Financial Measures\nNet sales and gross profit are the most significant drivers of our operating performance. Net sales consists of all\nmerchandise sales to customers, net of returns, shipping revenue associated with e-commerce sales, gift card breakage\nrevenue, revenue earned from our private label credit card program and excludes sales taxes. Gross profit is the\ndifference between net sales and cost of sales. Cost of sales has five distinct components: merchandise cost (including\nproduct costs, inbound freight expenses, inventory shrink and damages), store occupancy costs, outbound freight costs\n(including both store and e-commerce shipping expenses), central distribution costs and depreciation of store and\ndistribution center assets. Merchandise and outbound freight costs are variable, while occupancy and central\ndistribution costs are largely fixed. Accordingly, gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales can be influenced\nby many factors including overall sales performance.\nWe use comparable sales to measure sales increases and decreases from stores that have been open for at least\n13 full fiscal months, including our online sales. We remove closed stores from our comparable sales calculation the\nday after the stores close. Relocated stores remain in our comparable sales calculation. E-commerce sales, including\nshipping revenue, are included in comparable sales. Increases in comparable sales are an important factor in\nmaintaining or increasing our profitability.\nOperating expenses, including the costs of operating our stores and corporate headquarters, are also an important\ncomponent of our operating performance. Compensation and benefits comprise the majority of our operating expenses.\nOperating expenses contain fixed and variable costs, and managing the operating expense ratio (operating expenses\nexpressed as a percentage of net sales) is an important focus of management as we seek to increase our overall\nprofitability. Operating expenses include cash costs as well as non-cash costs, such as depreciation and amortization\nassociated with omni-channel technology, corporate property and equipment, and impairment of long-lived assets.\nBecause many operating expenses are fixed costs, and because operating costs tend to rise over time, increases in\ncomparable sales typically are necessary to prevent meaningful increases in the operating expense ratio. Operating\n28\nexpenses can also include certain costs that are of a one-time or non-recurring nature. While these costs must be\nconsidered to fully understand our operating performance, we typically identify such costs separately where significant\nin the consolidated statements of operations so that we can evaluate comparable expense data across different periods.\nStore Strategy\nOur store strategy emphasizes maintaining our store count, while still exiting under-performing stores and\nrelocating selected stores to better locations. We are prioritizing improvement in overall profitability and developing\na future state plan for infrastructure that complements our omni-channel concept and improves the customer\nexperience. Annually, we anticipate a small amount of store closures and limited store openings as we execute our\nstore strategy over the next several years.\nThe following table summarizes store information for the periods indicated:\n53 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended\nFebruary 3, 2024 January 28, 2023\nNew store openings — 1\nPermanent store closings 16 16\nStore relocations 1 —\nDecrease in store units (4.6)% (4.2)%\nDecrease in store square footage (4.0)% (3.5)%\nThe following table summarizes store information as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023:\nAs of As of\nFebruary 3, January 28,\n2024 2023\nNumber of stores 330 346\nSquare footage 2,677,439 2,790,128\nAverage square footage per store 8,113 8,064\nCash Flow\nOur cash and cash equivalents were $3.8 million and $5.2 million at February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023,\nrespectively, mainly reflecting our strategy to keep cash and cash equivalents at low levels in order to minimize the\namount of borrowings on our credit agreements. Our objective is to finance our operating activities for fiscal 2024\nwith borrowings available under our credit agreements and cash flows from operations. We anticipate minimal uses\nof cash from investing activities in fiscal 2024. Due to the seasonal nature of our product flow and our borrowing\ncapacity being limited by a percentage of eligible inventory and eligible credit card receivables, less reserves and an\nexcess required availability covenant, we anticipate a very disciplined approach to cash flow management throughout\nfiscal 2024, as we execute our financial turnaround strategy.\n29\nFiscal 2023 Compared to Fiscal 2022\nResults of operations. The table below sets forth selected results of our operations both in dollars (in thousands)\nand as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated:\nFiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022 Change\n$ % $ % $ %\nNet sales $468,690 100.0% $498,825 100.0% $ (30,135) (6.0)%\nCost of sales 341,700 72.9 379,036 76.0 (37,336) (9.9)\nGross profit 126,990 27.1 119,789 24.0 7,201 6.0\nOperating expenses:\nCompensation and benefits 82,152 17.5 85,231 17.1 (3,079) (3.6)\nOther operating expenses 62,863 13.4 69,183 13.9 (6,320) (9.1)\nDepreciation (exclusive of depreciation\nincluded in cost of sales) 4,522 1.0 6,055 1.2 (1,533) (25.3)\nAsset impairment 1,867 0.4 2,071 0.4 (204) (9.9)\nOperating loss (24,414 ) (5.2) (42,751) (8.6) 18,337 (42.9)\nInterest expense 3,317 0.7 1,735 0.4 1,582 91.2\nOther income (499 ) (0.1) (335) (0.1) (164) 49.0\nLoss before income taxes (27,232 ) (5.8) (44,151) (8.9) 16,919 (38.3)\nIncome tax expense 519 0.1 543 0.1 (24) (4.4)\nNet loss $ (27,751 ) (5.9)% $ (44,694) (9.0)% $ 16,943 (37.9)%\nNet sales. Net sales decreased 6.0% to $468.7 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $498.8 million in fiscal 2022.\nThe net sales decrease of $30.1 million in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to a consolidated comparable sales decrease\nof $23.1 million and a non-comparable sales decrease of $13.6 million, primarily related to store closures, partially\noffset by $6.6 million in sales due to the extra week in fiscal 2023. Comparable sales decreased mainly due to a\ndecrease in traffic and average ticket in stores and online, partially offset by an increase in conversion. On a 52-week\nbasis, comparable store sales decreased 2.9% and comparable e-commerce sales decreased 9.8%, for a consolidated\ncomparable sales decrease of 4.8%. In fiscal 2023, e-commerce sales were 25.8% of our net sales. Merchandise\ncategories performing below prior period levels include wall décor and furniture, while decorative accessories and gift\nperformed above prior period levels.\nGross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales improved 310 basis points from 24.0% in fiscal 2022 to\n27.1% in fiscal 2023. The overall improvement in gross profit margin was due to favorable merchandise margin,\ndepreciation expense, outbound freight costs and distribution center costs, partially offset by unfavorable store\noccupancy expense. Merchandise margin increased approximately 270 basis points from 51.4% in fiscal 2022 to\n54.1% in fiscal 2023 mainly due to the lower inbound freight costs and lower inventory levels, along with improved\nproduct flow. Depreciation of store and distribution center assets decreased approximately 50 basis points to 1.6% of\nnet sales in fiscal 2023 due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Outbound freight costs, including both store\nand e-commerce shipping expenses, decreased approximately 40 basis points to 7.6% of net sales primarily due to\nlower inventory levels and fewer shipping routes to the stores. Distribution center costs decreased approximately 40\nbasis points to 5.5% of net sales due to lower operating costs because of the lower inventory levels and the closure of\nour North Las Vegas, Nevada and Winchester, Virginia e-commerce order fulfillment centers to reduce fixed costs\nand consolidate our operations. Store occupancy costs increased approximately 90 basis points to 12.3% of net sales\ndue to the sales deleverage on these fixed costs.\nCompensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits as a percentage of net sales increased approximately 40\nbasis points from 17.1% in fiscal 2022 to 17.5% in fiscal 2023, primarily due to the deleverage of store payroll\nexpenses.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately 50\nbasis points from 13.9% in fiscal 2022 to 13.4% in fiscal 2023. The decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily\nrelated to a reduction in advertising expenses.\n30\nIncome tax expense. We recorded income tax expense of $0.5 million, or 1.9% of the loss before income taxes,\nduring fiscal 2023 compared to income tax expense of $0.5 million, or 1.2% of the loss before income taxes, during\nthe prior year period. We have a full valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets including federal and state net\noperating loss carry-forwards. Income tax expense in both periods is primarily related to current state income tax\nexpense. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 3 — Income Taxes” for further discussion.\nNet loss. As a result of the foregoing, we reported net loss of $27.8 million, or $2.16 per diluted share, for fiscal\n2023 compared to net loss of $44.7 million, or $3.52 per diluted share, for fiscal 2022.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our audited consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we provide certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA,\nadjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating loss. These measures are not in accordance with, and are not intended as\nalternatives to, GAAP financial measures. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our\nfinancial results and believe that they provide useful information to analysts and investors, as a supplement to GAAP\nfinancial measures, in evaluating our operational performance.\nWe define EBITDA as net loss before interest and the provision for income tax, which is equivalent to operating\nloss, adjusted for depreciation and asset impairment, adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA with non-GAAP adjustments and\nadjusted operating loss as adjusted EBITDA including depreciation.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard\nmeanings prescribed by GAAP. Use of these terms may differ from similar measures reported by other companies.\nEach non-GAAP financial measure has its limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in\nisolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. The Company’s non-GAAP\nadjustments remove stock-based compensation expense, due to the non-cash nature of this expense, and remove\nseverance and lease termination costs, as those expenses can fluctuate based on the needs of the business and do not\nrepresent a normal, recurring operating expense.\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of operating loss to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted\noperating loss for the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2024 and the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2023:\n53 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended\nFebruary 3, 2024 January 28, 2023\nOperating loss $ (24,414) $ (42,751)\nDepreciation 11,980 16,522\nAsset impairment(1) 1,867 2,071\nEBITDA (10,567) (24,158)\nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nTotal adjustments in cost of sales(2) — 46\nStock-based compensation expense(3) 1,186 1,961\nSeverance charges(4) 995 839\nTotal adjustments in operating expenses 2,181 2,800\nTotal non-GAAP adjustments 2,181 2,846\nAdjusted EBITDA (8,386) (21,312)\nDepreciation 11,980 16,522\nAdjusted operating loss $ (20,366) $ (37,834)\n(1) Asset impairment charges are related to property and equipment, software costs, cloud computing implementation\ncosts and other assets. Asset impairment was previously shown as a non-GAAP adjustment. The current\npresentation includes asset impairment as a reconciling item between operating loss and EBITDA. Prior periods\nhave been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\n(2) Costs associated with asset disposals, closed store and lease termination costs.\n(3) Stock-based compensation expense includes amounts expensed related to equity incentive plans.\n31\n(4) Severance charges include expenses related to severance agreements and permanent store closure compensation\ncosts.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal capital requirements are for working capital and capital expenditures. Working capital consists\nmainly of merchandise inventories offset by accounts payable, which typically reach their peak in the early portion of\nthe fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Capital expenditures primarily relate to technology and omni-channel projects,\ndistribution center and supply chain enhancements, new or relocated stores and existing store refreshes, remodels and\nmaintenance. Historically, we have funded our working capital and capital expenditure requirements with internally\ngenerated cash and borrowings under our asset-based revolving credit facility. In fiscal 2023, we entered into an\nadditional asset-based delay-draw term loan to provide additional liquidity, as internally generated cash and\nborrowings under our existing asset-based revolving credit facility will not provide enough liquidity to effectively\nexecute our financial turnaround strategy in fiscal 2024.\nCash flows from operating activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $14.5 million in fiscal 2023\ncompared to $18.2 million in fiscal 2022. Cash flows from operating activities depends heavily on operating\nperformance and changes in working capital. The decrease in the amount of cash flows used in operations in fiscal\n2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily due to improved operating performance, partially offset by changes in\nworking capital.\nCash flows from investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $4.6 million and\n$8.1 million for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe table below sets forth capital expenditures by category (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\n53 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended\nFebruary 3, 2024 January 28, 2023\nTechnology and omni-channel projects $ 1,896 $ 4,066\nExisting store refreshes, remodels and maintenance 1,671 2,134\nNew and relocated stores 829 404\nCorporate 269 399\nDistribution center and supply chain enhancements 114 1,117\nTotal capital expenditures $ 4,779 $ 8,120\nThe capital expenditures in fiscal 2023 related primarily to technology and omni-channel projects, existing store\nrefreshes, remodels and maintenance and new and relocated stores. The capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 related\nprimarily to technology and omni-channel projects, existing store refreshes, remodels and maintenance and\ndistribution center and supply chain enhancements. We expect minimal capital expenditures in fiscal 2024.\nCash flows from financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $17.7 million and $6.4\nmillion in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, we borrowed a net $19.0 million and $15.0\nmillion, respectively, under our revolving credit facility. During fiscal 2022, we repurchased and retired approximately\n$6.3 million shares of common stock, while we had no share repurchases in fiscal 2023.\nCredit agreements. On March 31, 2023, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the\n“2023 Credit Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, and lender. The\n2023 Credit Agreement amended the previous Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “2019 Credit\nAgreement”) from a $75.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility to a $90.0 million senior secured revolving\ncredit facility. The 2023 Credit Agreement contains substantially similar terms and conditions as the 2019 Credit\nAgreement including a swingline availability of $10.0 million, a $25.0 million incremental accordion feature and\nextended its maturity date to March 2028. The fee paid to the lenders on the unused portion of the 2023 Credit\nAgreement is 25 basis points when usage is greater than 50% of the facility amount; otherwise, the fee on the unused\nportion is 37.5 basis points per annum. Under the 2019 Credit Agreement, the fee on the unused portion was 25 basis\npoints per annum.\n32\nOn January 25, 2024, we entered into a First Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\nthat increased the advance rate and allowed us to enter into a new Term Loan Credit Agreement. Subsequent to January\n25, 2024, advances under the 2023 Credit Agreement accrue interest at an annual rate equal to the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (“SOFR”) plus a margin of 275 basis points with no SOFR floor. Upon the demonstration that our\nfixed charge coverage ratio is greater than 1.0 to 1.0 on a trailing twelve-month basis, the interest rate permanently\ndecreases on the 2023 Credit Agreement to SOFR plus a margin of 225 basis points. Prior to January 25, 2024,\nadvances under the 2023 Credit Agreement accrued interest at an annual rate equal to SOFR plus a margin ranging\nfrom 200 to 250 basis points with no SOFR floor. Advances under the 2019 Credit Agreement accrued interest at an\nannual rate equal to SOFR, or the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) through December 16, 2022, plus a\nmargin ranging from 125 to 175 basis points with no SOFR or LIBOR floor.\nWe are subject to a Second Amended and Restated Security Agreement (“Security Agreement”) with our lenders.\nPursuant to the Security Agreement, we pledged and granted to the administrative agent, for the benefit of itself and\nthe secured parties specified therein, a lien on and security interest in all of the rights, title and interest in substantially\nall of our assets to secure the payment and performance of the obligations under the 2023 and 2019 Credit Agreements.\nOn January 25, 2024, we entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement with Gordon Brothers Group (the “Term\nLoan Lender”), via an affiliate entity, 1903P Loan Agent, LLC, as administrative agent and lender. The Term Loan\nCredit Agreement provides for a $12.0 million, “first-in, last-out” delayed-draw asset-based term loan (the “Term\nLoan”). The indebtedness under the Term Loan is subordinated in most respects to the 2023 Credit Agreement. We\nare required to draw at least $5.0 million (“Tranche A Loan”) on or before April 1, 2024. If we make the initial draw\nof the Tranche A Loan on or before April 1, 2024, thereafter and through January 31, 2028, we will be permitted to\nmake additional draws of the Term Loan of up to $7.0 million, in increments of $1.0 million (the “Tranche B Loan”).\nThe Term Loan will mature in March 2028, coterminous with the 2023 Credit Agreement. From closing until the\napplicable adjustment date, the interest rate of the Term Loan will be one-month term SOFR, plus a margin of 9.50%.\nFollowing the applicable adjustment date, the interest rate will increase to one-month term SOFR, plus a margin of\n11.50%. The adjustment date shall be on the first anniversary of the closing, unless the parties enter into a lease\nrenegotiation services agreement with an affiliate of the Term Loan Lender within 90 days after closing, in which case\nthe adjustment date will be on the second anniversary of the closing.\nBorrowings under the 2023 Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Credit Agreement are subject to certain\nconditions and contain customary events of default, including, without limitation, failure to make payments, a cross-\ndefault to certain other debt, breaches of covenants, breaches of representations and warranties, a change in control,\ncertain monetary judgments and bankruptcy and ERISA events. Upon any such event of default, the principal amount\nof any unpaid loans and all other obligations under the 2023 Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Credit Agreement\nmay be declared immediately due and payable. The maximum availability under the 2023 Credit Agreement and the\nTerm Loan Credit Agreement is limited by a borrowing base formula, which consists of a percentage of eligible\ninventory and eligible credit card receivables, less reserves and an excess required availability covenant, which limits\nthe borrowing base formula by the greater of 10% of the combined borrowing base formula or $8.0 million.\nAs of February 3, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants in the 2023 Credit Agreement and the Term\nLoan Credit Agreement. As of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, there were $34.0 million and $15.0 million in\noutstanding borrowings under the 2023 or 2019 Credit Agreement, respectively. There were no borrowings under the\nTerm Loan Credit Agreement and no letters of credit outstanding at either February 3, 2024 or January 28, 2023. As\nof February 3, 2024, we had approximately $18.1 million available for borrowing under the 2023 Credit Agreement\nand the Term Loan Credit Agreement, after the minimum required excess availability covenant.\nSubsequent to February 3, 2024, we borrowed a net additional $6.0 million under the 2023 Credit Agreement\nand $5.0 million under the Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nWhile we anticipate that we will be managing cash flow tightly throughout fiscal 2024, as we execute our\nfinancial turnaround strategy, we believe that the combination of availability under our 2023 Credit Agreement and\nour Term Loan Credit Agreement, our cash balances, cash flow from operations, including reductions in operating\nexpenses, will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months.\nShare repurchase plans. On December 3, 2020, September 2, 2021 and January 6, 2022, we announced that our\nBoard of Directors authorized share repurchase plans providing for the purchase in the aggregate of up to $20.0\n33\nmillion, $20.0 million and $30.0 million, respectively, of our outstanding common stock. Repurchases of shares are\nmade in accordance with applicable securities laws and may be made from time to time in the open market or by\nnegotiated transactions. The amount and timing of repurchases are based on a variety of factors, including stock price,\nregulatory limitations and other market and economic factors. The share repurchase plans do not require us to\nrepurchase any specific number of shares, and we may terminate the repurchase plans at any time. As of February 3,\n2024, we had approximately $26.3 million remaining under the January 6, 2022 share repurchase plan.\nThe table below sets forth selected share repurchase plan information (in thousands, except share amounts) for\nthe periods indicated:\n53 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended\nFebruary 3, 2024 January 28, 2023\nShares repurchased and retired — 479,966\nShare repurchase cost $ — $ 6,253\nSeasonality and Quarterly Results\nWe have historically experienced, and expect to continue to experience, substantial seasonal fluctuations in our\nnet sales and operating results. We believe this is the general pattern typical of our segment of the retail industry and\nexpect that this pattern will continue in the future. Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly\nas a result of a variety of other factors, including the timing of store closings and openings, customer traffic changes,\nshifts in the timing of certain holidays and competition. Consequently, comparisons between quarters are not\nnecessarily meaningful, and the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nOur strongest sales period is the fourth quarter of our fiscal year when we generally realize a disproportionate\namount of our net sales and a substantial majority of our operating and net income. In anticipation of the increased\nsales activity during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, we purchase large amounts of inventory and hire temporary\nemployees for our stores. Our operating performance could suffer if net sales were below seasonal norms during the\nfourth quarter of our fiscal year.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of our operations are based upon our\nconsolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect\nthe reported amounts contained in the financial statements and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical\nexperience and on various other assumptions, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual\nresults may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies are discussed in the notes to our consolidated\nfinancial statements. Certain judgments and estimates utilized in implementing these accounting policies are likewise\ndiscussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion aggregates the various critical\naccounting policies addressed throughout the financial statements, the judgments and uncertainties affecting the\napplication of these policies and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under varying\nconditions and assumptions.\nInventory valuation — Our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, net of reserves and\nallowances, with cost determined using the average cost method, with average cost approximating current cost.\nInventory cost consists of the direct cost of merchandise including freight. The carrying value of our inventory is\naffected by reserves for shrinkage, damages and obsolescence.\nWe estimate as a percentage of sales the amount of inventory shrinkage that has occurred between the most\nrecently completed physical inventory count and the end of the financial reporting period based upon historical\nphysical inventory count results. Management adjusts these estimates based on changes, if any, in the trends yielded\nby our physical inventory counts, which occur during the fiscal year. Historically, the variation between our recorded\nestimates and observed results has been insignificant, and although possible, significant future variation is not\nexpected. If our estimated shrinkage reserve varied by 10% from the amount recorded, the carrying value of inventory\nwould have changed approximately $210,000 as of February 3, 2024.\n34\nWe also evaluate the cost of our inventory by category and class of merchandise in relation to the estimated sales\nprice. This evaluation is performed to ensure that we do not carry inventory at a value in excess of the amount we\nexpect to realize upon the sale of the merchandise. Our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory reduce merchandise\ninventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value based upon our historical experience of selling goods below cost.\nHistorically, the variation between our estimates to account for excess and obsolete inventory and actual results has\nbeen insignificant. As of February 3, 2024, our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was approximately $929,000.\nImpairment of long-lived assets — We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of long-lived assets,\nincluding lease right-of-use assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may\nnot be recoverable. This review includes the evaluation of individual under-performing retail stores and assessing the\nrecoverability of the carrying value of the assets related to the stores. Future cash flows are projected for the remaining\nlease life. If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, we record an impairment\ncharge equal to the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value. The fair value is estimated using a\ndiscounted cash flow approach considering such factors as future sales levels, gross margins, changes in rent and other\nexpenses as well as the overall operating environment specific to that store. The amount of the impairment charge is\nallocated proportionately to all assets in the asset group with no asset written down below its individual fair value. We\nestimate the individual fair value of long-lived fixed assets based on orderly liquidation value and the individual fair\nvalue of lease right-of-use assets based on market participant rents.\nOur asset impairment charges were $1.9 million and $2.1 million for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. If our\nestimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values change or our operating results\ndeteriorate, we may be exposed to additional losses that could be material.\nInsurance reserves — Workers’ compensation and general liability insurance programs are predominately self-\ninsured. It is our policy to record a self-insurance liability using estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported or\npaid, based on historical claims experience and actuarial methods. The assumptions made by management in\nestimating our self-insurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience and judgments about the\npresent and expected levels of cost per claim. As we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding\nthe assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred, we will adjust our reserves accordingly. As of\nFebruary 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, our self-insurance reserve estimates, net of estimated stop-loss insurance\nreceivables, related to workers’ compensation and general liability insurance programs were $4.2 million and $3.8\nmillion, respectively.\nActuarial methods are used to develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred\nas of the balance sheet dates. Management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods\nused to determine our self-insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that\nmanagement uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks. Arriving at these estimates, however,\nrequires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management; and, as a result, these estimates are uncertain\nand our actual exposure may be different from our estimates. For example, changes in our assumptions about health\ncare costs, the severity of accidents, the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary\nmaterially from our assumptions and estimates, causing our reserves to be understated or overstated. For instance, a\n10% change in our self-insurance liabilities would have affected pre-tax loss by approximately $417,000 for fiscal\n2023.\nIncome taxes — Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial\nstatement and the tax law treatment of certain items. Realization of certain components of deferred tax assets is\ndependent upon the occurrence of future events. We record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to\nthe amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. These valuation allowances can be impacted by changes\nin tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates, and future taxable income levels and are based on our judgment, estimates\nand assumptions regarding those future events. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize\nall or a portion of the net deferred tax assets in the future, we would increase the valuation allowance through a charge\nto income tax expense in the period that such determination is made. Conversely, if we were to determine that we\nwould be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future, in excess of the net carrying amounts, then we would\ndecrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease to income tax expense in the period that such\ndetermination is made. Due to changes in facts and circumstances and the estimates and judgments that are involved\nin determining the proper valuation allowance, differences between actual events and prior estimates and judgments\n35\ncould result in adjustments to this valuation allowance. As of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, we have a full\nvaluation allowance against deferred tax assets, as we have a three-year cumulative loss before income taxes.\nOur income tax returns are subject to audit by local, state and federal tax authorities, which include questions\nregarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among\nvarious tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax exposures associated with our filing positions, we record reserves for\nprobable exposures. We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual\nresults of a settlement with tax authorities differ from our established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the\nrelevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our tax contingencies\nreserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate\nthe exposures associated with our various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for\nrecognition of tax benefits have been met. We do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a\nmaterial change in the reserves established for tax benefits not recognized. Although we believe our judgments and\nestimates are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.\nWe have no unrecognized tax benefit reserve as of February 3, 2024.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate changes, primarily as a result of borrowings under our 2023 and 2019 Credit\nAgreements and our Term Loan Credit Agreement, as discussed in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary\nData – Note 4 — Credit Agreements and Note 12 — Subsequent Events,” which bear interest based on variable rates.\nAs of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, we had $34.0 million and $15.0 million, respectively, of outstanding\nborrowings under our 2023 and 2019 Credit Agreements. We had no borrowings under our Term Loan Credit\nAgreement at February 3, 2024. We incurred interest expense of approximately $3.3 million and $1.7 million in fiscal\n2023 and 2022, respectively, due to rising interest rates and higher borrowings. Subsequent to February 3, 2024, we\nborrowed a net additional $6.0 million under our 2023 Credit Agreement and $5.0 million under our Term Loan Credit\nAgreement.\nWe manage cash and cash equivalents in various institutions at levels beyond federally insured limits per\ninstitution, and we may purchase investments not guaranteed by the FDIC. Accordingly, there is a risk that we will\nnot recover the full principal of our investments or that their liquidity may be diminished.\nWe were not engaged in any foreign exchange contracts, hedges, interest rate swaps, derivatives or other similar\nfinancial instruments as of February 3, 2024.\nPurchase Price Volatility\nAlthough we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales\nand results of operations are affected by both. We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain\nproducts and services, as well as duties, tariffs, diesel fuel and transportation services. Therefore, we may experience\nboth inflationary and deflationary pressure on product costs, which may affect consumer demand and, as a result, sales\nand gross margin. Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effect of purchase price volatility by taking advantage of\neconomies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most\ncompetitive vendors without sacrificing quality.\n36\nItem 8.

(the Company) as of February 3,\n2024 and January 28, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for\neach of the three fiscal years in the period ended February 3, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as\nthe “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the financial position of the Company at February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, and the results of\nits operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended February 3, 2024, in conformity\nwith U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,\nan audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding\nof internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis\nfor our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion\non the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter\nbelow, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n38\nEstimate of Workers' Compensation Self-Insurance Reserves\nDescription of the At February 3, 2024, the Company’s reserve for workers’ compensation self-insurance\nMatter risks was $4.2 million. As discussed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, the\nCompany retains a significant portion of risk for its workers’ compensation exposure.\nAccordingly, provisions are recorded based upon periodic estimates of such losses, as\ndetermined by management. The future claims costs for the workers’ compensation\nexposure are estimated using actuarial methods that consider assumptions for a number of\nfactors including, but not limited to, historical claims experience and loss development\nfactors.\nAuditing management’s estimate of the recorded workers’ compensation reserve was\ncomplex and judgmental due to the significant assumptions and judgments required by\nmanagement to project the exposure for incurred claims that remain unresolved, including\nthose which have been incurred but not yet reported to the Company.\nHow We Addressed To test the Company’s estimate of the workers’ compensation reserve, we performed audit\nthe Matter in Our procedures that included, among others, assessing the actuarial valuation methodologies\nAudit utilized by management, testing the significant assumptions described above, testing the\nrelated underlying data used by the Company in its evaluation for completeness and\naccuracy, and testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculations. Our audit procedures\nalso included, among others, comparing the significant assumptions used by management\nto industry accepted actuarial assumptions and reassessing the accuracy of management’s\nhistorical estimates utilized in prior period evaluations. We involved our actuarial\nvaluation specialists to assist in assessing the valuation methodologies and significant\nassumptions noted above and to develop an independent range of estimates for the\nworkers’ compensation reserve which we then compared to management’s estimates.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2006.\nNashville, Tennessee\nMarch 29,

business — Kirkland’s is a specialty retailer of home décor and furnishings in the United States\noperating 330 stores in 35 states as of February 3, 2024, as well as an e-commerce website, www.kirklands.com, under\nthe Kirkland’s Home brand.\nPrinciples of consolidation — The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of\nKirkland’s, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Kirkland’s Stores, Inc., Kirkland’s DC, Inc. and Kirkland’s Texas,\nLLC. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of estimates — The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ\nfrom the estimates and assumptions used.\nChanges in estimates are recognized in the period when new information becomes available to management.\nAreas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from\namounts estimated include, but are not limited to, impairment assessments on long-lived assets, inventory reserves,\nself-insurance reserves and deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\nFiscal year — The Company’s fiscal year is comprised of the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Saturday\nclosest to January 31. Accordingly, fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 represented the 53 weeks ended on February 3, 2024,\nthe 52 weeks ended on January 28, 2023 and the 52 weeks ended on January 29, 2022, respectively.\nReclassifications — Certain amounts in the fiscal 2022 and 2021 consolidated statement of cash flows in the\ncash flows from operating activities section have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2023 presentation. Income\ntaxes refundable is no longer material to be presented as a separate line item and has been reclassified into either\nprepaid and other current assets or accrued expenses.\nCash and cash equivalents — Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit in banks and payments due\nfrom banks for customer credit cards, as they generally settle within 24-48 hours.\nInventory — The Company’s inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, net of reserves and\nallowances, with cost determined using the average cost method, with average cost approximating current cost.\nInventory cost consists of the direct cost of merchandise including freight. The carrying value of our inventory is\naffected by reserves for shrinkage, damages and obsolescence.\nThe Company incurs various types of warehousing, transportation and delivery costs in connection with\ninventory purchases and distribution. Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories and\nrecognized as a component of cost of sales as the related inventory is sold. As of February 3, 2024 and January 28,\n2023, there were $5.7 million and $6.3 million, respectively, of distribution center costs included in inventory on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company estimates as a percentage of sales the amount of inventory shrinkage that has occurred between\nthe most recently completed physical inventory count and the end of the financial reporting period based upon\nhistorical physical inventory count results. The Company adjusts these estimates based on changes, if any, in the trends\nyielded by its physical inventory counts, which occur during the fiscal year. The reserve for estimated inventory\nshrinkage was $2.1 million and $1.6 million as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively.\nThe Company estimates a reserve for unknown damaged inventory based on historical damage data.\nManagement adjusts these estimates based on any changes in actual damage results. The reserve for estimated\n44\ndamaged inventory was approximately $775,000 and $1.0 million as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023,\nrespectively.\nThe Company also evaluates the cost of inventory by category and class of merchandise in relation to the\nestimated sales price. This evaluation is performed to ensure that inventory is not carried at a value in excess of the\namount expected to be realized upon the sale of the merchandise. As of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, the\nreserve for excess and obsolescence was approximately $929,000 and $181,000, respectively.\nThe Company receives various payments and allowances from vendors, including rebates and other credits. The\namounts received are subject to the terms of vendor agreements, which generally do not state an expiration date, but\nare subject to ongoing negotiations that may be impacted in the future based on changes in market conditions and\nchanges in the profitability, quality or sell-through of the related merchandise. For all such vendor allowances, the\nCompany records the vendor funds as a reduction of inventories. As the related inventory is sold, such allowances and\ncredits are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales.\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets — The Company recognizes assets for expenses paid but not yet\nincurred, as well as other items such as miscellaneous receivables. As of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023,\nprepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets included receivables of approximately\n$2.6 million and $842,000, respectively.\nProperty and equipment — Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.\nDepreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Furniture,\nfixtures and equipment are generally depreciated over five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the\nshorter of the useful life of the asset or the expected lease term, typically ranging from five to 10 years. Maintenance\nand repairs are expensed as incurred, and improvements are capitalized. Gains or losses on the disposition of fixed\nassets are recorded upon disposal of the related asset.\nCost of internal use software — The Company capitalizes the cost of computer software developed or obtained\nfor internal use. Capitalized computer software costs consist primarily of payroll-related and consulting costs incurred\nduring the application development stage. The Company expenses costs related to preliminary project assessments,\nresearch and development, re-engineering, training and application maintenance as they are incurred. Capitalized\nsoftware costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated life of three to 10 years. For fiscal years 2023,\n2022 and 2021, the Company recorded approximately $4.8 million, $6.4 million and $7.1 million, respectively, for\ndepreciation of capitalized software. The net book value of these assets totaled $11.3 million and $15.5 million at the\nend of fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Property and equipment included capitalized computer software\ncurrently under development of approximately $49,000 and $400,000 as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023,\nrespectively.\nAsset retirement obligations — The Company recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement\nobligations (“ARO”) when such obligations are incurred. The Company’s AROs are primarily associated with\nleasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, the Company is contractually obligated to remove in order to\ncomply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, the Company records an ARO\nliability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. The liability\nis estimated based on various assumptions requiring management’s judgment and is accreted to its projected future\nvalue over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the convention for depreciation of leasehold improvement\nassets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual\nretirement costs incurred is recognized as an operating gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations. As of\nFebruary 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, the liability for asset retirement obligations was approximately $663,000 and\n$724,000, respectively, and the asset was approximately $86,000 and $115,000, respectively.\nLeases — Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date. Operating lease\nliabilities represent the present value of future lease payments. Operating lease assets represent the Company’s right\nto use an underlying asset and are based upon the operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepayments or accrued lease\npayments, initial direct costs, lease incentives, and impairment, if any, of operating lease assets. To determine the\npresent value of lease payments not yet paid at lease commencement or modification, the Company uses the\ncollateralized incremental borrowing rate corresponding to the reasonably certain lease term. The Company estimates\n45\nits collateralized incremental borrowing rate based upon a synthetic credit rating and yield curve analysis. See “Note\n5 — Leases” for further discussion.\nImpairment of long-lived assets — The Company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amounts of long-\nlived assets, including lease right-of-use assets, when events or changes in circumstances dictate that their carrying\nvalues may not be recoverable. This review includes the evaluation of individual under-performing retail stores and\nassessing the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets related to the stores. Future cash flows are projected for\nthe remaining lease life. If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, the Company\nrecords an impairment charge equal to the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value. The fair value\nis estimated using a discounted cash flow approach considering such factors as future sales levels, gross margins,\nchanges in rent and other expenses as well as the overall operating environment specific to that store. The amount of\nthe impairment charge is allocated proportionately to all assets in the asset group, with no asset written down below\nits individual fair value. The Company estimates the individual fair value of long-lived fixed assets based on orderly\nliquidation value and the individual fair value of lease right-of-use assets based on market participant rents. See “Note\n10 — Impairment” for further discussion.\nInsurance reserves — Workers’ compensation, general liability and employee medical insurance programs are\npredominately self-insured. It is the Company’s policy to record a self-insurance liability using estimates of claims\nincurred but not yet reported or paid, based on historical claims experience and actuarial methods. Actual results can\nvary from estimates for many reasons, including, changes in our assumptions about health care costs, the severity of\naccidents, the average size of claims and other factors. The Company monitors its claims experience in light of these\nfactors and revises its estimates of insurance reserves accordingly. The level of insurance reserves may increase or\ndecrease as a result of these changing circumstances or trends. As of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, the\nCompany’s self-insurance reserve estimates, net of estimated stop-loss insurance receivables, related to workers’\ncompensation and general liability were $4.2 million and $3.8 million, respectively. As of February 3, 2024 and\nJanuary 28, 2023, the Company’s self-insurance reserve estimates, net of estimated stop-loss insurance receivables,\nrelated to employee medical insurance were approximately $456,000 and $701,000, respectively.\nNet sales — The Company recognizes revenue at the time of sale of merchandise to customers in its stores. E-\ncommerce revenue is recorded at the estimated time of delivery to the customer. Net sales includes the sale of\nmerchandise, net of returns, shipping revenue, gift card breakage revenue and revenue earned from our private label\ncredit card program and excludes sales taxes.\nSales returns reserve — The Company reduces net sales and estimates a liability for sales returns based on\nhistorical return trends, and the Company believes that its estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future\nreturns associated with past sales. However, as with any estimate, refund activity may vary from estimated amounts.\nThe Company had a liability of approximately $1.5 million reserved for sales returns at both February 3, 2024 and\nJanuary 28, 2023, included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets. The related sales return reserve\nproducts recovery asset included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets was\napproximately $710,000 and $705,000 at February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively.\nDeferred e-commerce revenue — E-commerce revenue is deferred until the customer takes possession of the\nmerchandise and the sale is complete, as the Company receives payment before completion of its customer obligations.\nDeferred revenue related to e-commerce orders that have been shipped but not estimated to be received by customers\nincluded in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets was approximately $750,000 and $685,000 at\nFebruary 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively. The related contract assets, reflected in inventory on the\nconsolidated balance sheets, totaled approximately $387,000 and $359,000 at February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023,\nrespectively. E-commerce shipping expenses are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in the consolidated\nstatements of operations as a component of cost of sales.\nGift cards — Gift card sales are recognized as revenue when tendered for payment. While the Company honors\nall gift cards presented for payment, the Company determines the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain\ngift card balances due to long periods of inactivity. The Company uses the redemption recognition method to account\nfor breakage for unused gift card amounts where breakage is recognized as gift cards are redeemed for the purchase\nof goods based upon a historical breakage rate. In these circumstances, to the extent the Company determines there is\n46\nno requirement for remitting unredeemed card balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, such\namounts are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of net sales.\nThe table below sets forth selected gift card liability information (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\nFebruary 3, January 28, January 29,\n2024 2023 2022\nGift card liability, net of estimated breakage (included in accrued\nexpenses) $ 12,008 $ 14,077 $ 14,761\nThe table below sets forth selected gift card breakage and redemption information (in thousands) for the periods\nindicated:\n53 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended\nFebruary 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022\nGift card breakage revenue (included in net sales) $ 2,195 $ 1,419 $ 1,425\nGift card redemptions recognized in the current period related\nto amounts included in the gift card contract liability balance\nas of the prior period 4,800 5,321 5,129\nCustomer loyalty program — The Company has established a loyalty program called the K-club, whereby\nmembers receive access to coupons, birthday rewards, monthly sweepstakes, sneak peeks, exclusive deals and more.\nThe Company’s loyalty program offers points to members on qualifying purchases that are converted into certificates\nthat may be redeemed on future purchases. This customer option is a material right and, accordingly, represents a\nseparate performance obligation to the customer under ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. The\nallocated consideration for the points earned by loyalty program members is deferred based on the standalone selling\nprice of the points and recorded within accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet. The measurement of\nstandalone selling prices takes into consideration the estimated points that will be converted to certificates and\ncertificates that are expected to be redeemed, based on historical redemption patterns. This measurement is applied to\nthe Company’s portfolio of performance obligations for points earned, as all obligations have similar economic\ncharacteristics. The Company believes the impact to its consolidated financial statements would not be materially\ndifferent if this measurement was applied to each individual performance obligation. Revenue is recognized for these\nperformance obligations at a point in time when certificates are redeemed by the customer. These obligations generally\nrelate to contracts with terms less than one year, as points generally expire on a rolling 12-month basis and certificates\ngenerally expire within two months from issuance. The related loyalty program deferred revenue included in accrued\nexpenses on the consolidated balance sheets was approximately $1.4 million and $1.2 million as of February 3, 2024\nand January 28, 2023, respectively.\nPrivate label credit card — The Company has a private label credit card program for its customers. Each private\nlabel credit card bears the logo for the Kirkland’s brand and can only be used at the Company’s store locations and e-\ncommerce channel. The card program is operated and managed by a third-party bank, Wells Fargo, that assumes all\nof the losses associated with non-payment by the private label card holders and a portion of any fraudulent usage of\nthe accounts.\nPursuant to the private-label credit card program, the Company receives cash incentives in exchange for\npromised services, such as licensing our brand names and marketing the credit card program to customers. The\nCompany can receive incentive payments for the achievement of certain private label credit card volumes and is also\nreimbursed for certain costs associated with the private label credit card. Funds received related to the Company’s\nprivate label credit card program are recorded as net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Services\npromised under these agreements are separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized as the Company fulfills\nits performance obligations throughout the contract term.\nCost of sales — Cost of sales includes the cost of product purchased from vendors, inbound freight, receiving\ncosts, inspection costs, warehousing costs, outbound freight, inventory damage and shrinkage, payroll and overhead\nassociated with our distribution facility and its network, store occupancy costs and depreciation of leasehold\nimprovements, equipment, and other property in the stores and distribution centers. Distribution facility costs,\n47\nexcluding depreciation, included in cost of sales were approximately $25.9 million, $29.5 million and $23.2 million\nfor fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCompensation and benefits — Compensation and benefits includes all store and corporate office salaries, wages\nand incentive pay as well as stock compensation, employee health benefits, 401(k) plan benefits, social security and\nunemployment taxes.\nStock-based compensation — Stock-based compensation includes expenses associated with restricted stock unit\ngrants, performance stock unit grants, stock option grants, and other transactions under the Company’s stock plans.\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for its stock-based payments based on the fair value of the awards\non the grant date. The expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the vesting period within compensation and\nbenefits in the consolidated statements of operations. See “Note 6 — Stock-Based Compensation” for further\ndiscussion.\nOther operating expenses — Other operating expenses consist of such items as advertising, credit card\nprocessing costs, bank fees, utilities, professional fees, software maintenance costs, supplies, workers’ compensation\nand general liability insurance, trash removal, maintenance and repairs, travel and various other store and corporate\nexpenses.\nAdvertising expenses — Advertising costs are expensed in the period in which the related activity first takes\nplace. These expenses include costs associated with specific marketing campaigns, direct mail, email communications,\npaid search, digital advertising, social media, public relations and in-store signage. Total advertising expense was\n$13.6 million, $18.3 million and $22.0 million for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Prepaid advertising costs\nwere approximately $7,000 and $17,000 as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively.\nIncome taxes — Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial\nstatement and the tax law treatment of certain items. Realization of certain components of deferred tax assets is\ndependent upon the occurrence of future events. The Company records valuation allowances to reduce its deferred tax\nassets to the amount it believes is more likely than not to be realized. These valuation allowances can be impacted by\nchanges in tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates, and future taxable income levels and are based on the Company’s\njudgment, estimates and assumptions regarding those future events. In the event the Company was to determine that\nit would not be able to realize all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets in the future, the Company would increase\nthe valuation allowance through a charge to income tax expense in the period that such determination is made.\nConversely, if the Company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future, in\nexcess of the net carrying amounts, the Company would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease\nto income tax expense in the period that such determination is made. As of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023,\nthe Company has a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, as the Company has a three-year cumulative\nloss before income taxes.\nThe Company provides for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties, if any, based upon\nmanagement’s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax\nauthorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax\nexpense. To the extent the Company prevails in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is\nestablished or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability, the Company’s effective tax rate in a given financial\nstatement period may be affected.\nThe Company’s income tax returns are subject to audit by local, state and federal tax authorities, and the\nCompany is typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time. Tax contingencies often arise due to\nuncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which the\nCompany operates. The contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits, changes in tax laws, litigation,\nappeals and experience with previous similar tax positions. The Company regularly reviews its tax reserves for these\nitems and assesses the adequacy of the amount recorded. The Company evaluates potential exposures associated with\nits various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is\nto evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more\nlikely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation\n48\nprocesses, if any. The second step requires estimation and measurement of the tax benefit as the largest amount that\nis more than 50% likely to be recognized upon settlement. See “Note 3 — Income Taxes” for further discussion.\nSales and use taxes — Governmental authorities assess sales and use taxes on the sale and purchase of goods\nand services. The Company excludes taxes collected from customers in its reported net sales results. Such amounts\nare reflected as accrued expenses until remitted to the taxing authorities.\nConcentrations of risk — The Company has risk of geographic concentration with respect to the sourcing of its\ninventory purchases. Approximately 73% of the Company’s inventory purchases in fiscal 2023 were from China.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash and\ncash equivalents. The Company’s cash balances are primarily on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions.\nFair value measurements — Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The\nCompany uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers\ninclude: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other\nthan quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as\nunobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own\nassumptions.\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair\nvalue because of their short maturities. The revolving line of credit approximates fair value due to the one, three or\nsix-month interest terms. The Company also has a non-depleting collateral trust with the Company’s workers’\ncompensation and general liability insurance provider named as beneficiary. The assets in this trust are invested in\nfinancial instruments that would fall within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, and they are included in other assets\non the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company measures certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis, including the evaluation of long-\nlived assets for impairment using Company-specific assumptions, including forecasts of projected financial\ninformation that would fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company uses market participant rents\n(Level 2 input) to calculate the fair value of right-of-use assets and discounted future cash flows of the asset or asset\ngroup using a discount rate that approximates the cost of capital of a market participant (Level 2 input) to quantify\nfair value for other long-lived assets. See “Note 10 — Impairment” for further discussion.\n(Loss) earnings per share — Basic (loss) earnings per share is computed by dividing net (loss) income by the\nweighted average number of shares outstanding during each period presented. Diluted (loss) earnings per share is\ncomputed by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect\nof stock equivalents outstanding during the applicable periods using the treasury stock method. Diluted (loss) earnings\nper share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if options to purchase stock were exercised into common stock\nand if outstanding grants of restricted stock were vested. Stock options and restricted stock units that were not included\nin the computation of diluted earnings per share, because to do so would have been antidilutive, were approximately\n689,000 shares, 571,000 shares and 134,000 shares for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nComprehensive (loss) income — Comprehensive (loss) income does not differ from the consolidated net (loss)\nincome presented in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOperating segments — The Company is a specialty retailer of home décor that offers its products in its stores\nand on its website. The Company has determined that each of its stores and its e-commerce operations is an operating\nsegment. The operating performance of all stores and e-commerce has been aggregated into one reportable segment.\nThe Company’s operating segments are aggregated for financial reporting purposes because they are similar in each\nof the following areas: economic characteristics, class of consumer, nature of products and distribution methods.\nRevenues from external customers are derived from merchandise sales, and the Company does not rely on any major\ncustomers as a source of revenue. Across its store base, the Company operates one store format under the Kirkland’s\nHome brand name in which each store offers the same general mix of merchandise with similar categories and similar\ncustomers.

Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are as follows (in thousands):\nFebruary 3, January 28,\n2024 2023\nDeferred tax assets:\nOperating lease liabilities $ 36,406 $ 39,661\nAccruals 2,090 1,327\nInventory valuation 277 346\nFederal and state tax credit carryforwards 192 148\nFederal and state net operating loss carryforwards 15,794 11,169\nImpairment 1,321 1,321\nOther 3,989 3,583\nTotal deferred tax assets 60,069 57,555\nValuation allowance for deferred tax assets (21,206) (14,690)\nNet deferred tax assets 38,863 42,865\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nProperty and equipment (5,974) (7,737)\nOperating lease right-of-use assets (32,194) (34,435)\nPrepaid assets (695) (693)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (38,863) (42,865)\nNet deferred tax assets $ — $ —\nAs of February 3, 2024, the Company has a $61.9 million federal net operating loss carry-forward and $51.3\nmillion of state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future taxable income. The federal net operating\nloss carry-forward does not expire and the state net operating loss carry-forwards expire in years 2037 through 2042.\nAs of February 3, 2024, the Company has a federal tax credit carry-forward of approximately $135,000 that expires\nin year 2044 and state tax credit carry-forwards of approximately $72,000 that expire in years 2024 through 2025.\nFuture utilization of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by the Company, and any valuation allowance is adjusted\naccordingly. The Company has a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets due to uncertainty regarding\ntheir realization. Accordingly, the Company has established a valuation allowance of $21.2 million and $14.7 million\nwith respect to deferred tax assets as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively. Adjustments could be\nrequired in the future if the Company estimates that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized is more or less\nthan the net amount the Company has recorded. Any change in the valuation allowance would have the effect of\nincreasing or decreasing the income tax provision based on the nature of the deferred tax asset deemed realizable in\nthe period in which such a determination is made.\nThe Company and one or more of its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and\nvarious state and local jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by\nauthorities for years prior to 2020. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to state and local income\ntax examinations for years prior to 2018. The Company is not currently engaged in any U.S. federal, state or local\nincome tax examinations.\nThe Company had no unrecognized tax benefits as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023. The Company\naccrues interest on unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Penalties, if incurred, would be\nrecognized as a component of income tax expense. The Company had no amounts accrued for the payment of interest\nand penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits as of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023.\nNote 4 — Credit Agreements\nOn March 31, 2023, the Company entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “2023\nCredit Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, and lender. The 2023\nCredit Agreement amended the previous Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “2019 Credit\nAgreement”) from a $75.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility to a $90.0 million senior secured revolving\n51\ncredit facility. The 2023 Credit Agreement contains substantially similar terms and conditions as the 2019 Credit\nAgreement including a swingline availability of $10.0 million, a $25.0 million incremental accordion feature and\nextended its maturity date to March 2028. The fee paid to the lenders on the unused portion of the 2023 Credit\nAgreement is 25 basis points when usage is greater than 50% of the facility amount; otherwise, the fee on the unused\nportion is 37.5 basis points per annum. Under the 2019 Credit Agreement, the fee on the unused portion was 25 basis\npoints per annum.\nOn January 25, 2024, the Company entered into a First Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit\nAgreement that increased the advance rate and allowed the Company to enter into a new Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nSubsequent to January 25, 2024, advances under the 2023 Credit Agreement accrue interest at an annual rate equal to\nthe Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus a margin of 275 basis points with no SOFR floor. Upon the\ndemonstration that the Company’s fixed charge coverage ratio is greater than 1.0 to 1.0 on a trailing twelve-month\nbasis, the interest rate permanently decreases on the 2023 Credit Agreement to SOFR plus a margin of 225 basis\npoints. Prior to January 25, 2024, advances under the 2023 Credit Agreement accrued interest at an annual rate equal\nto SOFR plus a margin ranging from 200 to 250 basis points with no SOFR floor. Advances under the 2019 Credit\nAgreement accrued interest at an annual rate equal to SOFR, or the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)\nthrough December 16, 2022, plus a margin ranging from 125 to 175 basis points with no SOFR or LIBOR floor.\nThe Company is subject to a Second Amended and Restated Security Agreement (“Security Agreement”) with\nits lenders. Pursuant to the Security Agreement, the Company pledged and granted to the administrative agent, for the\nbenefit of itself and the secured parties specified therein, a lien on and security interest in all of the rights, title and\ninterest in substantially all of the Company’s assets to secure the payment and performance of the obligations under\nthe 2023 and 2019 Credit Agreements.\nOn January 25, 2024, the Company entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement with Gordon Brothers Group\n(the “Term Loan Lender”), via an affiliate entity, 1903P Loan Agent, LLC, as administrative agent and lender. The\nTerm Loan Credit Agreement provides for a $12.0 million, “first-in, last-out” delayed-draw asset-based term loan (the\n“Term Loan”). The indebtedness under the Term Loan is subordinated in most respects to the 2023 Credit Agreement.\nThe Company is required to draw at least $5.0 million (“Tranche A Loan”) on or before April 1, 2024. If the Company\nmakes the initial draw of the Tranche A Loan on or before April 1, 2024, thereafter and through January 31, 2028, the\nCompany will be permitted to make additional draws of the Term Loan of up to $7.0 million, in increments of $1.0\nmillion (the “Tranche B Loan”). The Term Loan will mature in March 2028, coterminous with the 2023 Credit\nAgreement. From closing until the applicable adjustment date, the interest rate of the Term Loan will be one-month\nterm SOFR, plus a margin of 9.50%. Following the applicable adjustment date, the interest rate will increase to one-\nmonth term SOFR, plus a margin of 11.50%. The adjustment date shall be on the first anniversary of the closing,\nunless the parties enter into a lease renegotiation services agreement with an affiliate of the Term Loan Lender within\n90 days after closing, in which case the adjustment date will be on the second anniversary of the closing.\nBorrowings under the 2023 Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Credit Agreement are subject to certain\nconditions and contain customary events of default, including, without limitation, failure to make payments, a cross-\ndefault to certain other debt, breaches of covenants, breaches of representations and warranties, a change in control,\ncertain monetary judgments and bankruptcy and ERISA events. Upon any such event of default, the principal amount\nof any unpaid loans and all other obligations under the 2023 Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Credit Agreement\nmay be declared immediately due and payable. The maximum availability under the 2023 Credit Agreement and the\nTerm Loan Credit Agreement is limited by a borrowing base formula, which consists of a percentage of eligible\ninventory and eligible credit card receivables, less reserves and an excess required availability covenant, which limits\nthe borrowing base formula by the greater of 10% of the combined borrowing base formula or $8.0 million.\nAs of February 3, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the covenants in the 2023 Credit Agreement and\nthe Term Loan Credit Agreement. As of February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, there were $34.0 million and $15.0\nmillion in outstanding borrowings under the 2023 or 2019 Credit Agreement, respectively. There were no borrowings\nunder the Term Loan Credit Agreement and no letters of credit outstanding at either February 3, 2024 or January 28,\n2023. As of February 3, 2024, the Company had approximately $18.1 million available for borrowing under the 2023\nCredit Agreement and the Term Loan Credit Agreement, after the minimum required excess availability covenant.\n52\nNote 5 — Leases\nThe Company leases retail store facilities, corporate office space, warehouse facilities and certain vehicles and\nequipment under operating leases with terms generally ranging up to 10 years and expiring at various dates through\nfiscal 2033. Most of the retail store agreements include an initial term with renewal options and provide for minimum\nfixed rental payments. The Company does not include lease renewal options in the lease term for calculations of its\nright-of-use assets and liabilities until it is reasonably certain that the Company plans to renew these leases. A few\nretail store lease agreements have only variable lease payments based on a percentage of sales, while other store leases\ncontain contingent rentals based on sales performance in excess of specified minimums in addition to minimum fixed\nrentals.\nThe majority of the Company’s leases have monthly fixed rent with additional costs that are not components of\nthe lease (e.g., real estate taxes and insurance costs) and non-lease components (e.g., common area maintenance) either\nof which can be variable or fixed. These additional non-lease components are excluded from the calculation of the\nlease liability and right-of-use asset. The Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, so the incremental\nborrowing rate, based on the information available at commencement or modification date, is used in determining the\npresent value of lease payments. The Company has elected not to recognize leases with an original term of one year\nor less on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company's classification of lease cost on the Company's consolidated statements of operations is as follows\n(in thousands):\n53 Week Period 52 Week Period 52 Week Period\nEnded (1) Ended (1) Ended (1)\nFebruary 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022\nCost of sales (2)\nOperating lease cost $ 46,066 $ 44,960 $ 37,241\nShort-term lease cost 1,308 2,662 1,144\nVariable lease cost 1,226 1,367 2,102\nTotal lease cost in cost of sales 48,600 48,989 40,487\nOther operating expenses\nOperating lease cost 1,651 1,657 1,701\nShort-term lease cost 66 67 53\nTotal lease cost in other operating expenses 1,717 1,724 1,754\nTotal lease cost $ 50,317 $ 50,713 $ 42,241\n(1) Total lease cost excludes expense for non-lease components including common area maintenance and excludes costs that are\nnot a component of the lease including real estate taxes, insurance, sales taxes and utilities for the Company’s leases.\n(2) Cost of sales includes all distribution center lease costs and store occupancy-related lease costs.\nAs of February 3, 2024, future minimum payments, by year and in the aggregate, under all operating leases with\ninitial terms of one year or more consist of the following (in thousands):\nOperating\nLeases\n2024 $ 45,082\n2025 40,685\n2026 31,490\n2027 22,721\n2028 13,605\nThereafter 13,163\nTotal lease payments 166,746\nLess: interest (26,956)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 139,790\n53\nThe Company’s lease term and discount rate is as follows:\nFebruary 3, 2024\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years) 4.5\nWeighted-average discount rate 8.1%\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities is as follows (in thousands):\n53 Weeks 52 Weeks 52 Weeks\nEnded Ended Ended\nFebruary 3, January 28, January 29,\n2024 2023 2022\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 51,515 $ 53,415 $ 53,220\nNote 6 — Stock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation — Stock-based compensation includes restricted stock unit grants, performance-\nbased restricted stock unit grants, stock option grants and other transactions under the Company’s equity plans. Total\nstock-based compensation expense is included as a component of compensation and benefits on the consolidated\nstatements of operations and was approximately $1.2 million, $2.0 million and $1.7 million for fiscal years 2023, 2022\nand 2021, respectively.\nOn June 4, 2013, the Company adopted the Kirkland’s, Inc. Amended and Restated 2002 Equity Incentive Plan\n(the “2002 Plan”), replacing the plan adopted in July 2002. The 2002 Plan provides for the award of restricted stock,\nrestricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance-based awards, incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options and\nstock appreciation rights with respect to shares of the Company’s common stock to employees, directors, consultants\nand other individuals who perform services for the Company. The 2002 Plan is authorized to provide awards for up\nto a maximum of 4,500,000 shares of common stock.\nAs of February 3, 2024, options to purchase 259,222 shares of common stock were outstanding under the 2002\nPlan at exercise prices ranging from $3.53 to $25.52 per share. As of February 3, 2024, there were 397,682 RSUs\noutstanding under the 2002 Plan with fair value grant prices ranging from $2.82 to $24.68 per share. The number of\nshares reserved for future stock-based grants under the 2002 Plan was 1,043,553 at February 3, 2024.\nRestricted stock units — The Company grants restricted stock units for a fixed number of shares to various\nemployees and directors. The restriction is removed when the shares vest and shares of common stock are given to\nthe employee or director. The RSUs granted to directors become 100% vested on the first anniversary of the grant\ndate. The RSUs granted to employees in fiscal 2021, 2022 and 2023 vest 33% annually on the anniversary of the grant\ndate over three years, except for one grant to the interim CEO in fiscal 2023, which vests 100% on the first anniversary\nof the grant date and one grant to the CFO in fiscal 2022, which vests 100% on the third anniversary of the grant date.\nThe fair values of the RSUs are equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant.\nCompensation expense related to RSUs is recognized ratably over the requisite service period. The Company accounts\nfor forfeiture of RSUs as they occur. As of February 3, 2024, there was approximately $859,000 of unrecognized\ncompensation expense related to RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.8\nyears.\nRSU activity for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024, was as follows:\nWeighted\nAverage\nGrant Date\nShares Fair Value\nNon-Vested at January 28, 2023 399,987 $ 9.84\nGranted 374,440 2.83\nVested (202,967) 8.49\nForfeited (173,778) 9.52\nNon-Vested at February 3, 2024 397,682 $ 4.07\n54\nOther information related to RSU activity during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:\n53 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended\nFebruary 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022\nWeighted average grant date fair value of RSUs (per share) $ 2.83 $ 8.35 $ 24.23\nTotal fair value of restricted stock units vested (in thousands) $ 560 $ 8,596 $ 2,846\nPerformance-based restricted stock units — During fiscal 2022 and 2021, the Company granted 42,225 and\n51,892 performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”), respectively, with a weighted average grant date fair value\nof $11.17 and $26.72, respectively, per share, that are subject to the achievement of specified performance goals over\na specified performance period. The performance metrics for the PSUs are EBITDA compared to budgeted EBITDA\nand a relative shareholder return modifier. The number of PSUs granted represent the shares that could have been\nachieved had the target-level of achievement been met for the applicable performance metrics. The actual number of\nshares issued under the PSU awards was determined by the level of achievement of the performance goals and the\ntotal shareholder return modifier. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, the Company did not record compensation expense\nrelated to the PSUs, as the performance metric based on EBITDA for fiscal 2022 and 2021 was not achieved and, as\nsuch, no shares were issued with respect to these PSUs.\nStock options — The Company allows for the settlement of vested stock options on a net share basis (“net share\nsettled stock options”) or on a gross basis with the holder providing cash to cover the option exercise price and the\nminimum statutory tax withholdings. With net share settled stock options, the employee does not surrender any cash\nor shares upon exercise. Rather, the Company withholds the number of shares to cover the option exercise price and\nthe minimum statutory tax withholding obligations from the shares that would otherwise be issued upon exercise. The\nsettlement of vested stock options on a net share basis results in fewer shares issued by the Company. Options issued\nto employees under the 2002 Plan have maximum contractual terms of 10 years. Options granted in fiscal 2022 and\n2023 vest 33% annually on the anniversary of the grant date over three years, except for one grant to the interim CEO\nin fiscal 2023, which vests 100% on the first anniversary of the grant date.\nStock option activity for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024 was as follows:\nWeighted Weighted Average\nNumber of Average Remaining Contractual Aggregate Intrinsic\nOptions Exercise Price Term (in years) Value (in thousands)\nBalance at January 28, 2023 97,641 $ 11.00\nOptions granted 237,675 3.53\nOptions forfeited (67,344) 5.36\nOptions expired (8,750) 14.87\nBalance at February 3, 2024 259,222 $ 5.49 8.1 $ —\nOptions Exercisable As of:\nFebruary 3, 2024 51,103 $ 13.17 4.1 $ —\nThe aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represent the total difference between the Company’s closing\nstock price at year-end and the option exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options at fiscal year-\nend. As of February 3, 2024, there were no outstanding in-the-money options. The fair value of each option is recorded\nas compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the applicable vesting period. At February 3, 2024, unrecognized\nstock compensation expense related to the unvested portion of outstanding stock options was approximately $281,000,\nwhich is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.0 years.\n55\nOther information related to option activity during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:\n53 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended\nFebruary 3, 2024 January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022\nWeighted average grant date fair value of options granted (per\nshare) $ 2.06 $ 3.11 $ —\nTotal fair value of stock options vested (in thousands) $ 57 $ 49 $ 84\nIntrinsic value of stock options exercised (in thousands) $ — $ 8 $ 945\nThe Company has estimated the fair value of all stock option awards as of the date of the grant by applying the\nBlack-Scholes option pricing model. The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental\nand highly subjective in the determination of compensation expense. The Company granted 237,675 stock options in\nfiscal 2023 and 40,000 stock options in fiscal 2022. The Company did not grant any stock options in fiscal 2021. The\nweighted averages for key assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted in fiscal 2023 and 2022,\nand a summary of the methodology applied to develop each assumption are as follows:\n53 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended\nFebruary 3, 2024 January 28, 2023\nExpected price volatility 92.4% 91.4%\nRisk-free interest rate 3.3% 3.4%\nExpected life 6 years 6 years\nDividend yield 0% 0%\nExpected price volatility — The expected price volatility is a measure of the amount by which the stock price\nhas fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate. The Company uses actual historical changes in the market value of its stock\nto calculate the volatility assumption as it is management’s belief that this is the best indicator of future volatility. The\nCompany calculates daily market value changes using the historical volatility of returns for the six years prior to the\ngrant. An increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense.\nRisk-free interest rate — The risk-free interest rate is the U.S. Treasury rate for the week of the grant having a\nterm equal to the expected life of the option. An increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase compensation\nexpense.\nExpected life — The expected life is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain\noutstanding. The Company uses the “simplified” method found in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff\nAccounting Bulletin No. 107 to estimate the expected life of stock option grants. Options granted have a maximum\nterm of 10 years. An increase in the expected life will increase compensation expense.\nForfeiture rate — The forfeiture rate is the percentage of options granted that were forfeited or canceled before\nbecoming fully vested. The Company accounts for forfeitures of options as they occur. An increase in the forfeiture\nrate will decrease compensation expense.\nNote 7 — Retirement Benefit Plan\n401(k) savings plan — The Company maintains a defined contribution 401(k) employee benefit plan, which\nprovides retirement benefits for eligible employees. The Company matches 100% of the employee’s elective\ncontributions up to 4% of eligible compensation. The Company’s matching contributions were approximately $1.1\nmillion in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. The Company has the option to make additional contributions to the 401(k)\nemployee benefit plan on behalf of covered employees; however, no such contributions were made in fiscal 2023,\n2022 or 2021.\nNote 8 — Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company was named as a defendant in a putative class action filed in May 2018 in the Superior Court of\nCalifornia, Miles v. Kirkland’s Stores, Inc. The case has been removed to United States District Court for the Central\nDistrict of California. The complaint alleges, on behalf of Miles and all other hourly Kirkland’s employees in\n56\nCalifornia, various wage and hour violations and seeks unpaid wages, statutory and civil penalties, monetary damages\nand injunctive relief. Kirkland’s denies the material allegations in the complaint and believes that its employment\npolicies are generally compliant with California law. On March 22, 2022, the District Court denied the plaintiff’s\nmotion to certify in its entirety, and on May 26, 2022, the Ninth Circuit granted the plaintiff’s petition for permission\nto appeal. The appeal was argued before the Ninth Circuit on November 13, 2023, and on January 8, 2024, the Court\nissued its opinion affirming the District Court in part and reversing in part. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the denial of\ncertification as to the subclasses related to the security bag check and reversed as to the rest break claim. The Ninth\nCircuit did not find that there is liability nor that the rest break claim is certified. The Company continues to believe\nthe case is without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations.\nThe Company was named as a defendant in a putative class action filed in August 2022 in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York, Sicard v. Kirkland’s Stores, Inc. The complaint alleges, on behalf\nof Sicard and all other hourly store employees based in New York, that Kirkland’s violated New York Labor Law\nSection 191 by failing to pay him and the putative class members their wages within seven calendar days after the end\nof the week in which those wages were earned, rather paying wages on a bi-weekly basis. Plaintiff claims the putative\nclass is entitled to recover from the Company the amount of their untimely paid wages as liquidated damages,\nreasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. The Company believes the case is without merit and intends to vigorously defend\nitself against the allegations.\nThe Company is also party to other pending legal proceedings and claims that arise in the normal course of\nbusiness. Although the outcome of such proceedings and claims cannot be determined with certainty, the Company’s\nmanagement is of the opinion that it is unlikely that such proceedings and any claims in excess of insurance coverage\nwill have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition, operating results or cash flows.\nNote 9 — Share Repurchase Plans\nOn December 3, 2020, September 2, 2021 and January 6, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of\nDirectors authorized a share repurchase plan providing for the purchase in the aggregate of up to $20.0 million, $20.0\nmillion and $30.0 million, respectively, of the Company’s outstanding common stock. Repurchases of shares are made\nin accordance with applicable securities laws and may be made from time to time in the open market or by negotiated\ntransactions.

The amendments in this ASU\nare required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual\nfinancial statements that have not yet been issued.
