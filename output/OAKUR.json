You or your proxyholder will be able to attend the virtual extraordinary general meeting online, vote, view the list of shareholders entitled to vote at the extraordinary general meeting and submit questions during the extraordinary general meeting by visiting https://www.cstproxy.com/oakwoodsacquisition/2024 and using a control number assigned by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, our Transfer Agent, where you will be able to listen to the meeting live and vote during the meeting. Additionally, you have the option to listen to the extraordinary general meeting by dialing +1 800-450-7155 (toll-free within the U.S. and Canada) or +1- 857-999-9155 (outside of the U.S. and Canada, standard rates apply). Please note that you cannot vote or ask questions if you choose to participate telephonically. Please note that you will only be able to access the extraordinary general meeting by means of remote communication. To register and receive access to the virtual meeting, registered shareholders and beneficial shareholders (those holding shares through a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other holder of record) will need to follow the instructions applicable to them provided in this proxy statement/prospectus. The record date for the extraordinary general meeting is September 4, 2024 (the “Record Date”). Only shareholders of record at the close of business on that date may attend and vote at the extraordinary general meeting or any adjournment thereof. A complete list of our shareholders of record entitled to attend and vote at the extraordinary general meeting will be available for ten days before the extraordinary general meeting at our principal executive offices for inspection by shareholders during ordinary business hours for any purpose germane to the extraordinary general meeting.\n\nEven if you plan to attend the Meeting, it is strongly recommended you complete and return your proxy card before the Meeting date, to ensure that your shares will be represented at the Meeting if you are unable to attend. You will not be required to attend the Meeting in person in order to vote.\n\nThe accompanying proxy statement (the “Proxy Statement”) is dated September 13, 2024, and was first posted to the Company’s website on September16, 2024 and also and also mailed to shareholders of the Company. The accompanying Proxy Statement describes the business the Company will conduct at the Meeting and provides information about the Company that you should consider when you vote your shares. The Meeting will be held for the purpose of considering and voting on the following proposals (the “Proposals”):\n\n1.Proposal No. 1 — The Extension Proposal as a special resolution, to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the “Charter”) pursuant to an amendment to the Charter in the form set forth in Annex A of the accompanying proxy statement to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination (a “business combination”) from September 28, 2024 (the “Current Outside Date”) to December 28, 2024 (the “Extended Date”) and to allow the Company, without another shareholder vote, by resolution of the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”), to elect to further extend the Extended Date in three-month increments up to 1 additional time, or a total of up to 6 months after the Current Outside Date, until up to March 28, 2025 (each, an “Additional Extended Date”), (the “Extension,” and such proposal, the “Extension Proposal”);\n\n2.Proposal No. 2 — The Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal as a special resolution, to amend the Charter pursuant to an amendment to the Charter in the form set forth in Annex B of the accompanying proxy statement to eliminate (i) the limitation that the Company may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause the Company’s net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and \n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\n(ii) the limitation that the Company shall not consummate a business combination unless the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately prior to, or upon consummation of, or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement that may be contained in the agreement relating to, such business combination (collectively, the “Redemption Limitation”) (the “Redemption Limitation Amendment,” and such proposal the “Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal”);\n\n3.Proposal No. 3 — The Founder Share Amendment Proposal as a special resolution, to amend the Charter pursuant to an amendment to the Charter in the form set forth in Annex C of the accompanying proxy statement to provide for the right of a holder of the Company’s Class B Ordinary Shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class B Ordinary Shares”), to convert into Class A Ordinary Shares, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the “Class A Ordinary Shares” or “public shares”) on a one-for-one basis at any time and from time to time prior to the closing of a business combination at the election of the holder (the “Founder Share Amendment,” and such proposal, the “Founder Share Amendment Proposal”); and\n\n4.Proposal No. 4 — The Adjournment Proposal as an ordinary resolution, to approve the adjournment of the Extraordinary General Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or convenient, (i) to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies in the event that there are insufficient votes for, or otherwise in connection with, the approval of the Extension Proposal, the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal or the Founder Share Amendment Proposal, or if we otherwise determine that additional time is necessary to effectuate the Extension, which will only be presented at the Extraordinary General Meeting if, based on the tabulated votes, there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Extraordinary General Meeting to approve the Extension Proposal, the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal or the Founder Share Amendment Proposal, in which case the Adjournment Proposal will be the only proposal presented at the Extraordinary General Meeting or (ii) if the Board determines before the Extraordinary General Meeting that it is not necessary or no longer desirable to proceed with the proposals (the “Adjournment Proposal”).\n\nEach of the Extension Proposal, the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal, the Founder Share Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal is more fully described in the accompanying proxy statement, which you are encouraged to read carefully. The Founder Share Amendment Proposal and Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal are cross-conditioned on the approval of the Extension Proposal. The Extension Proposal and Adjournment Proposal are not conditioned on the approval of any other proposal.\n\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE “FOR” THE EXTENSION PROPOSAL, THE REDEMPTION LIMITATION AMENDMENT PROPOSAL, THE FOUNDER SHARE AMENDMENT PROPOSAL AND, IF PRESENTED, THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL.\n\nThe sole purpose of the Extension Proposal is to provide the Company with sufficient time to complete a business combination. The Company’s prospectus for its initial public offering (the “IPO”) and its Charter initially provided that the Company had until September 28, 2024, or 18 months after the closing date of its IPO, to complete a business combination. The Board currently believes that there may not be sufficient time for the Company to consummate a business combination by the Current Outside Date. Accordingly, the Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company’s shareholders to extend the date by which the Company has to complete a business combination to the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable.\n\nThe purpose of the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal is to eliminate from the Charter the Redemption Limitation. Unless the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal is approved, we will not proceed with the Extension if redemptions of the public shares would cause the Company to exceed the Redemption Limitation. Further, if the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal is not approved and there are significant requests for redemption such that the Redemption Limitation would be exceeded, the Redemption Limitation would prevent the Company from being able to consummate a business combination. The Company believes that the Redemption Limitation is not needed. The purpose of such limitation was initially to ensure that the Company did not become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules. Because the public shares would not be deemed to be “penny stock” as such securities are listed on a national securities exchange, the Company is presenting the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal to facilitate the consummation of the Extension and a business combination. The Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders for the Company to be allowed to effect redemptions and a business combination irrespective of the Redemption Limitation.\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nThe purpose of the Founder Share Amendment Proposal is to provide the holders of the Class B Ordinary Shares with the flexibility to assist the Company in meeting the listing requirements of its Class A Ordinary Shares if necessary or desirable in connection with the Extension and the consummation of the Company’s business combination. This flexibility may also aid the Company in retaining investors. If the Extension Proposal and the Founder Share Amendment Proposal are approved, Whale Bay International Company Limited, the Company’s sponsor (the “Sponsor”) has informed the Company that it expects to convert all of the Class B Ordinary Shares into Class A Ordinary Shares prior to any redemption described below. Notwithstanding the conversion, the Sponsor will not be entitled to receive any monies held in the Trust Account (as defined below) as a result of its ownership of any shares of Class A Ordinary Shares.\n\nThe purpose of the Adjournment Proposal is to allow the Company to adjourn the Extraordinary General Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or convenient, if we determine that additional time is necessary to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies in the event that there are insufficient votes to approve the Extension Proposal, the Founder Share Amendment Proposal or the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal, or if we determine that additional time is necessary to effectuate the Extension, or if the Board determines before the Extraordinary General Meeting that it is not necessary or no longer desirable to proceed with the proposals.\n\nIn connection with the Extension, public shareholders may elect to redeem their shares for a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account established in connection with the IPO (the “Trust Account”), including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes, divided by the number of then-issued and outstanding public shares, regardless of how such public shareholders vote on the Extension Proposal or if they vote at all and regardless of whether they hold public shares on the Record Date established for the Extraordinary General Meeting. If the Extension is approved by the requisite vote of shareholders, the remaining public shareholders will retain their right to redeem their public shares upon consummation of our business combination, subject to any limitations set forth in the Charter, as amended. In addition, public shareholders will be entitled to have their shares redeemed for cash if the Company has not completed a business combination by the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable.\n\nIf the Extension Proposal is approved and the Extension is implemented, our Sponsor, or its designees will deposit into the Trust Account as a loan (a “Contribution,” and the Sponsor or its designee making such Contribution, a “Contributor”), (i) on or before September28, 2024, and (ii) one business day following the public announcement by the Company disclosing that the Board has determined to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination for an additional month, with respect to the extension to each such Additional Extended Date, an amount equal to $230,000, in each case in accordance with the Extension (each date on which a Contribution is to be deposited into the Trust Account, a “Contribution Date”). The maximum aggregate amount of Contributions will be $460,000. The Contributions will be evidenced by a non-interest bearing, unsecured convertible promissory note to the Contributor (the “Contribution Note”) and will be repayable by the Company upon consummation of a business combination (the “Maturity Date”). Such loans may be converted into warrants of the post-business combination entity, which shall have terms identical to the private placement warrants sold concurrently with the IPO, each exercisable for one Class A Ordinary Share at a purchase price of $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the Contributor. If the Company does not consummate a business combination by the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable, any such promissory notes will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. Any Contribution is conditioned on the approval of the Extension Proposal and the implementation of the Extension. No Contribution will occur if the Extension Proposal is not approved or the Extension is not implemented. If the Company has consummated a business combination or announced its intention to wind up prior to any Contribution Date, any obligation to make Contributions will terminate.\n\nBased upon the amount held in the Trust Account as of the Record Date (as defined below), which was $63,495,783.48 (including interest not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes), the Company estimates that the per-share price at which public shares may be redeemed from cash held in the Trust Account will be approximately $11.04 at the time of the Extraordinary General Meeting. The closing price of one Class A Ordinary Share on the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) on the Record Date was $11.03. Accordingly, if the market price were to remain the same until the date of the Extraordinary General Meeting, exercising redemption rights would result \n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nin a public shareholder receiving approximately $0.01 more per share than if such shareholder sold its public shares in the open market. The Company cannot assure shareholders that they will be able to sell their Class A Ordinary Shares in the open market, even if the market price per share is higher than the redemption price stated above, as there may not be sufficient liquidity in its securities when such shareholders wish to sell their shares.\n\nPursuant to the Charter, a public shareholder may request that the Company redeem all or a portion of such public shareholder’s public shares for cash if the Extension Proposal or Founder Share Amendment Proposal is approved. You will be entitled to receive cash for any public shares to be redeemed only if you:\n\n(i)(a) hold public shares or (b) hold public shares as part of units and elect to separate such units into the underlying public shares, public rights and public warrants prior to exercising your redemption rights with respect to the public shares; and\n\n(ii)prior to 12:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on September 23, 2024 (two business days prior to the vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting), (a) submit a written request to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company’s transfer agent, that the Company redeem your public shares for cash and (b) tender or deliver your public shares (and share certificates (if any) and other redemption forms) to the transfer agent, physically or electronically through The Depository Trust Company.\n\nHolders of units of the Company must elect to separate the underlying public shares, public rights and public warrants prior to exercising redemption rights with respect to the public shares. If holders hold their units in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, holders must notify their broker or bank that they elect to separate the units into the underlying public shares, public rights, and public warrants, or if a holder holds units registered in its, his or her own name, the holder must contact the transfer agent directly and instruct it to do so. Public shareholders may elect to redeem all or a portion of their public shares regardless of whether they vote for or against the Extension Proposal and the Founder Share Amendment Proposal, or do not vote at all, and regardless of whether they hold their public shares on the Record Date.\n\nIf the Extension is not approved and we do not consummate a business combination by September 28, 2024, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable and up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Board, liquidate and dissolve, subject to the approval of the remaining public shareholders and the Board, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in each case, to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, and rights which will expire worthless if we fail to complete a business combination by September 28, 2024 or by the applicable deadline as may be extended.\n\nApproval of each of the Extension Proposal, Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal and the Founder Share Amendment Proposal requires a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares (together, the “Ordinary Shares”) which are represented in person or by proxy and are voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\n\nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal requires an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of a majority of the Ordinary Shares which are represented in person or by proxy, or by corporate representative, and are voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\n\nThe Board has fixed the close of business on September 4, 2024, as the record date for the Extraordinary General Meeting (the “Record Date”). Only shareholders of record on September 4, 2024, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting or any adjournments and/or postponements thereof. Further information regarding voting rights and the matters to be voted upon is presented in the accompanying proxy statement.\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nYou are not being asked to vote on a business combination at this time. If the Extension is implemented and you do not elect to redeem your public shares in connection with the Extension, you will retain the right to vote on a business combination if and when such transaction is submitted to shareholders and the right to redeem your public shares for cash from the Trust Account in the event a proposed business combination is approved and completed or the Company has not consummated a business combination by the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable. If a business combination is not consummated by the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable, assuming the Extension is implemented, and the Company does not obtain an additional extension, the Company will redeem its public shares.\n\nTo ensure your representation at the Extraordinary General Meeting, you are urged to complete, sign, date and return your proxy card as soon as possible. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you must instruct your broker or bank on how to vote your shares. You may revoke your proxy card at any time prior to the Extraordinary General Meeting.\n\nA shareholder’s failure to vote in person or by proxy will not be counted towards the number of Ordinary Shares required to validly establish a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted in connection with the determination of whether a valid quorum is established.\n\nYOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT. Please sign, date and return your proxy card as soon as possible. You are requested to carefully read the proxy statement and accompanying Notice of Extraordinary General Meeting for a more complete statement of matters to be considered at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\n\nOn behalf of our board of directors, we would like to thank you for your support of Oak Woods Acquisition Corporation.\n\nSeptember16, 2024  \n---  \nBy Order of the Board,  \n/s/ Lixin Zheng  \nLixin Zheng  \nChief Executive Officer  \n  \nIf you return your proxy card signed and without an indication of how you wish to vote, your shares will be voted “FOR” each of the proposals.\n\nTO EXERCISE YOUR REDEMPTION RIGHTS, YOU MUST (1) IF YOU HOLD PUBLIC SHARES AS PART OF UNITS, ELECT TO SEPARATE YOUR UNITS INTO THE UNDERLYING PUBLIC SHARES, PUBLIC RIGHTS, AND PUBLIC WARRANTS PRIOR TO EXERCISING YOUR REDEMPTION RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE PUBLIC SHARES, (2)(A) SUBMIT A WRITTEN REQUEST TO THE TRANSFER AGENT AT LEAST TWO BUSINESS DAYS PRIOR TO THE VOTE AT THE EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING THAT YOUR PUBLIC SHARES BE REDEEMED FOR CASH AND (B) TENDER OR DELIVER YOUR PUBLIC SHARES (AND SHARE CERTIFICATES (IF ANY) AND OTHER REDEMPTION FORMS) TO THE TRANSFER AGENT, PHYSICALLY OR ELECTRONICALLY USING THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY’S DWAC (DEPOSIT WITHDRAWAL AT CUSTODIAN) SYSTEM, IN EACH CASE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROCEDURES AND DEADLINES DESCRIBED IN THE ACCOMPANYING PROXY STATEMENT.

The accompanying Proxy Statement describes the business the Company will conduct at the Meeting and provides information about the Company that you should consider when you vote your shares. The Meeting will be held for the purpose of considering and voting on the following proposals (the “Proposals”):\n\n1.Proposal No. 1 — The Extension Proposal as a special resolution, to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the “Charter”) pursuant to an amendment to the Charter in the form set forth in Annex A of the accompanying proxy statement to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination (a “business combination”) from September 28, 2024 (the “Current Outside Date”) to December 28, 2024 (the “Extended Date”) and to allow the Company, without another shareholder vote, by resolution of the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”), to elect to further extend the Extended Date in one-month increments up to 2 additional times, or a total of up to 6 months after the Current Outside Date, until up to March 28, 2025 (each, an “Additional Extended Date”), (the “Extension,” and such proposal, the “Extension Proposal”);\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\n2.Proposal No. 2 — The Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal as a special resolution, to amend the Charter pursuant to an amendment to the Charter in the form set forth in Annex B of the accompanying proxy statement to eliminate (i) the limitation that the Company may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause the Company’s net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and (ii) the limitation that the Company shall not consummate a business combination unless the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately prior to, or upon consummation of, or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement that may be contained in the agreement relating to, such business combination (collectively, the “Redemption Limitation”) (the “Redemption Limitation Amendment,” and such proposal the “Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal”);\n\n3.Proposal No. 3 — The Founder Share Amendment Proposal as a special resolution, to amend the Charter pursuant to an amendment to the Charter in the form set forth in Annex C of the accompanying proxy statement to provide for the right of a holder of the Company’s Class B Ordinary Shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class B Ordinary Shares”), to convert into Class A Ordinary Shares, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the “Class A Ordinary Shares” or “public shares”) on a one-for-one basis at any time and from time to time prior to the closing of a business combination at the election of the holder (the “Founder Share Amendment,” and such proposal, the “Founder Share Amendment Proposal”); and\n\n4.Proposal No. 4 — The Adjournment Proposal as an ordinary resolution, to approve the adjournment of the Extraordinary General Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or convenient, (i) to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies in the event that there are insufficient votes for, or otherwise in connection with, the approval of the Extension Proposal, the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal or the Founder Share Amendment Proposal, or if we otherwise determine that additional time is necessary to effectuate the Extension, which will only be presented at the Extraordinary General Meeting if, based on the tabulated votes, there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Extraordinary General Meeting to approve the Extension Proposal, the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal or the Founder Share Amendment Proposal, in which case the Adjournment Proposal will be the only proposal presented at the Extraordinary General Meeting or (ii) if the Board determines before the Extraordinary General Meeting that it is not necessary or no longer desirable to proceed with the proposals (the “Adjournment Proposal”).\n\nThe above matters are more fully described in the accompanying proxy statement. We urge you to read carefully the accompanying proxy statement in its entirety.\n\nThe sole purpose of the Extension Proposal is to provide the Company with sufficient time to complete a business combination. The Company’s prospectus for its initial public offering (the “IPO”) and its Charter initially provided that the Company had until September 28, 2024, or 18 months after the closing date of its IPO, to complete a business combination. The Board currently believes that there will not be sufficient time for the Company to consummate a business combination by the Current Outside Date. Accordingly, the Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company’s shareholders to extend the date by which the Company has to complete a business combination to the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable.\n\nThe purpose of the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal is to eliminate from the Charter the Redemption Limitation. Unless the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal is approved, we will not proceed with the Extension if redemptions of the public shares would cause the Company to exceed the Redemption Limitation. Further, if the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal is not approved and there are significant requests for redemption such that the Redemption Limitation would be exceeded, the Redemption Limitation would prevent the Company from being able to consummate a business combination. The Company believes that the Redemption Limitation is not needed. The purpose of such limitation was initially to ensure that the Company did not become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules. Because the public shares would not be deemed to be “penny stock” as such securities are listed on a national securities exchange, the Company is presenting the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal to facilitate the consummation of the Extension and a business combination. The Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders for the Company to be allowed to effect redemptions and a business combination irrespective of the Redemption Limitation.\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nThe purpose of the Founder Share Amendment Proposal is to provide the holders of the Class B Ordinary Shares with the flexibility to assist the Company in retaining investors and meeting the listing requirements of its Class A Ordinary Shares if necessary or desirable in connection with the Extension and the consummation of the Company’s business combination. This flexibility may also aid the Company in retaining investors. If the Extension Proposal and the Founder Share Amendment Proposal are approved, the Sponsor has informed the Company that it expects to convert all of the Class B Ordinary Shares into Class A Ordinary Shares prior to any redemption described below. Notwithstanding the conversion, the Sponsor will not be entitled to receive any monies held in the Trust Account (as defined below) as a result of its ownership of any shares of Class A Ordinary Shares.\n\nThe purpose of the Adjournment Proposal is to allow the Company to adjourn the Extraordinary General Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or convenient, if we determine that additional time is necessary to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies in the event that there are insufficient votes to approve the Extension Proposal, the Founder Share Amendment Proposal or the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal, or if we determine that additional time is necessary to effectuate the Extension, or if the Board determines before the Extraordinary General Meeting that it is not necessary or no longer desirable to proceed with the proposals.\n\nIf the Extension Proposal is approved and the Extension is implemented, Whale Bay International Company Limited, the Company’s sponsor (the “Sponsor”) or its designees will deposit into the Trust Account (as defined below) as a loan (a “Contribution,” and the Sponsor or its designee making such Contribution, a “Contributor”), (i) on or before September 28, 2024, with respect to the extension to the Extended Date, an amount equal to $230,000, and (ii) one business day following the public announcement by the Company disclosing that the Board has determined to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination for an additional month, with respect to the extension to each such Additional Extended Date, an amount equal to $230,000, in accordance with the Extension (each date on which a Contribution is to be deposited into the Trust Account, a “Contribution Date”). The maximum aggregate amount of Contributions will be $460,000. The Contributions will be evidenced by a non-interest bearing, unsecured convertible promissory note to the Contributor (the “Contribution Note”) and will be repayable by the Company upon consummation of a business combination (the “Maturity Date”). Such loans may be converted into warrants of the post-business combination entity, which shall have terms identical to the private placement warrants sold concurrently with the IPO, each exercisable for one Class A Ordinary Share at a purchase price of $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the Contributor. If the Company does not consummate a business combination by the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable, any such promissory notes will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. Any Contribution is conditioned on the approval of the Extension Proposal and the implementation of the Extension. No Contribution will occur if the Extension Proposal is not approved or the Extension is not implemented. If the Company has consummated a business combination or announced its intention to wind up prior to any Contribution Date, any obligation to make Contributions will terminate. Approval of the Extension Proposal is a condition to the implementation of the Extension. The Adjournment Proposal is not subject to these, or any other, conditions.\n\nApproval of each of the Extension Proposal, the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal and the Founder Share Amendment Proposal requires a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the Ordinary Shares which are represented in person or by proxy, or by corporate representative, or by corporate representative, and are voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\n\nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal requires an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of a majority of the Ordinary Shares which are represented in person or by proxy, or by corporate representative, or by corporate representative, and are voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\n\nIn connection with the Extension, public shareholders may elect to redeem their shares for a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account established in connection with the IPO (the “Trust Account”), including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes, divided by the number of then-issued and outstanding Class A Ordinary Shares, regardless of how such public shareholders vote on the Extension Proposal, or if they vote at all. If the Extension is approved by the requisite vote of shareholders, the remaining public shareholders will retain their right to redeem their Class A Ordinary Shares upon consummation of a business combination when it is submitted to a vote of the \n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nshareholders, subject to any limitations set forth in the Charter, as amended. In addition, public shareholders will be entitled to have their shares redeemed for cash if the Company has not completed a business combination by the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable.\n\nPursuant to the Charter, a public shareholder may request that the Company redeem all or a portion of such public shareholder’s public shares for cash if the Extension Proposal or the Founder Share Amendment Proposal is approved. You will be entitled to receive cash for any public shares to be redeemed only if you:\n\n(i)(a) hold public shares or (b) hold public shares as part of units and elect to separate such units into the underlying public shares, public rights, and public warrants prior to exercising your redemption rights with respect to the public shares; and\n\n(ii)prior to 12:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on September23, 2024 (two business days prior to the vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting), (a) submit a written request to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company’s transfer agent, that the Company redeem your public shares for cash and (b) tender or deliver your public shares (and share certificates (if any) and other redemption forms) to the transfer agent, physically or electronically through The Depository Trust Company.\n\nHolders of units must elect to separate the underlying public shares, public rights, and public warrants prior to exercising redemption rights with respect to the public shares. If holders hold their units in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, holders must notify their broker or bank that they elect to separate the units into the underlying public shares, public rights, and public warrants, or if a holder holds units registered in its, his or her own name, the holder must contact the transfer agent directly and instruct it to do so. Public shareholders may elect to redeem all or a portion of their public shares regardless of whether they vote for or against the Extension Proposal and the Founder Share Amendment Proposal, or do not vote at all, and regardless of whether they hold their public shares on the Record Date.\n\nIf the Extension is not approved and we do not consummate a business combination by September 28, 2024, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable and up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Board, liquidate and dissolve, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Board, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in each case, to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law.\n\nIf the Extension Proposal is approved, such approval will constitute consent for the Company to (i) remove from the Trust Account an amount (the “Withdrawal Amount”) equal to the number of public shares properly redeemed multiplied by the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares and (ii) deliver to the holders of such redeemed public shares their portion of the Withdrawal Amount. The funds remaining in the Trust Account after the removal of such Withdrawal Amount shall be available for use by the Company to complete a business combination on or before the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable. Holders of public shares who do not redeem their public shares now will retain their redemption rights and their ability to vote on a business combination through the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable, if the Extension Proposal is approved.\n\nThe withdrawal of the Withdrawal Amount will reduce the amount held in the Trust Account, and the amount remaining in the Trust Account may be significantly less than the $63,495,783.48 that was in the Trust Account as of the Record Date. In such an event, the Company may need to obtain additional funds to complete its business combination, and there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on terms acceptable to the parties or at all.\n\nOnly shareholders of record of the Company as of the close of business on September 4, 2024 (the “Record Date”), are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Extraordinary General Meeting or any adjournments and/or postponements thereof. Each Ordinary Share entitles the holder thereof to one vote. On the Record Date, there \n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nwere 6,093,125 Class A Ordinary Shares, par value $0.0001 per share, and 1,437,500 Class B Ordinary Shares, par value $0.0001 per share, issued and outstanding, respectively. The Company’s warrants and rights do not have voting rights in connection with the proposals.\n\nYour vote is important. Proxy voting permits shareholders unable to attend the Extraordinary General Meeting in person to vote their shares through a proxy. By appointing a proxy, your shares will be represented and voted in accordance with your instructions.

Please note that you cannot vote or ask questions if you choose to participate telephonically. This proxy statement summarizes the information that you need to make an informed decision on the proposals to be considered at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\n\nThe Company is a Cayman Islands exempted company incorporated on March 11, 2022 as a blank check company for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities.\n\nOn March 28, 2023, the Company consummated its IPO of 5,750,000 units (the “Public Units”), which includes the full exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option of 750,000 Public Units. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A Ordinary Share (“Class A Ordinary Share”), one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”) entitling its holder to purchase one share of Class A Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per share, and one right (“Right”) to receive one-sixth (1/6) of a share of Class A Ordinary Share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Public Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Public Unit, generating gross proceeds of $57,500,000. As of March 28, 2023, a total of $58,506,250 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement (as defined below) were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (“Continental”) acting as trustee. Our Charter provides for the return of the IPO proceeds held in the Trust Account to the holders of public shares if we do not complete a business combination by September 28, 2024.\n\nSimultaneously with the closing of the IPO on March 28, 2023, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with Whale Bay International Company Limited, our sponsor (the “Sponsor,”) purchasing units (the “Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $3,431,810.\n\nOn October 25, 2022, we issued an aggregate of 2,156,250 founder shares to our initial shareholders for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000 in cash, or approximately $0.012 per share. On February 10, 2023, our Sponsor surrendered, and we cancelled, an aggregate of 718,750 Class B Ordinary Shares held by our Sponsor pursuant to a share surrender agreement dated January 13, 2023. As a result, as of February 10, 2023 there were 1,437,500 founders shares issued and outstanding, resulting in an aggregate purchase price per share of approximately $0.017. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding Ordinary Shares upon completion of our IPO. The founder shares (including the Class A Ordinary Shares issuable upon conversion thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder.\n\nWhile the Company is currently proceeding with the filing of its preliminary and definitive proxy solicitation statements concerning the acquisition of Huajin (China) Holdings Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted holding company (“Huajin”), as described further in its third amended preliminary prospectus and proxy statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 20, 2024, the Board has determined that there may not be sufficient time before the Current Outside Date to complete a business \n\n2\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\ncombination. Accordingly, the Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company’s shareholders to extend the date by which the Company has to complete a business combination to the Extended Date or the Additional Extended Date, as applicable.\n\nIf the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal is not approved and there are significant requests for redemption such that the Company’s net tangible assets would be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of a business combination, the Charter would prevent the Company from being able to consummate the Extension or a business combination even if all other conditions to closing are met. The Company believes that the Redemption Limitation is not needed. The purpose of such limitation was initially to ensure that the Company would not be subject to the “penny stock” rules of the SEC, and therefore not a “blank check company” as defined under Rule 419 of the Securities Act because it complied with Rule 3a51-1(g)(1) (the “NTA Rule”). The NTA Rule is one of several exclusions from the “penny stock” rules of the SEC and it believes that it may rely on another exclusion, which relates to the Company being listed on Nasdaq (“Nasdaq”) (Rule 3a51-1(a)(2)) (the “Exchange Rule”). Therefore, the Company intends to rely on the Exchange Rule to not be deemed a penny stock issuer. The purpose of the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal is to eliminate from the Charter the Redemption Limitation. The Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders for the Company to be allowed to effect redemptions irrespective of the Redemption Limitation.\n\nThe purpose of the Founder Share Amendment Proposal is to provide the holders of the Class B Ordinary Shares with the flexibility to assist the Company in retaining investors and meeting the listing requirements of its Class A Ordinary Shares if necessary or desirable in connection with the Extension and the consummation of the Company’s business combination.\n\nQ:What is being voted on?\n\nA:You are being asked to vote on the following proposals:\n\n1.The Extension Proposal — as a special resolution, to amend the Charter pursuant to an amendment to the Charter in the form set forth in Annex A of the accompanying proxy statement to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination from the Current Outside Date to the Extended Date and to allow the Company, without another shareholder vote, by resolution of the Board, to elect to further extend the Extended Date to each Additional Extended Date;\n\n2.The Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal — as a special resolution, to amend the Charter pursuant to an amendment to the Charter in the form set forth in Annex B of the accompanying proxy statement to eliminate (i) the limitation that the Company may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause the Company’s net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and (ii) the limitation that the Company shall not consummate a business combination unless the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately prior to, or upon consummation of, or any greater net tangible asset or cash equivalent that may be contained in the agreement relating to, such business combination;\n\n3.The Founder Share Amendment Proposal — as a special resolution, to amend the Charter pursuant to an amendment to the Charter in the form set forth in Annex C of the accompanying proxy statement to provide for the right of a holder of the Company’s Class B Ordinary Shares to convert into Class A Ordinary Shares on a one-for-one basis at any time and from time to time prior to the closing of a business combination at the election of the holder; and\n\n4.The Adjournment Proposal — as an ordinary resolution, to approve the adjournment of the Extraordinary General Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or convenient, (i) to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies in the event that there are insufficient votes for, or otherwise in connection with, the approval of the Extension Proposal, the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal or the Founder Share Amendment Proposal, or if we otherwise determine that additional time is necessary to effectuate the Extension, which will only be presented at the Extraordinary General Meeting if, based on the tabulated votes, there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Extraordinary General Meeting to approve the Extension Proposal, the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal or the Founder Share Amendment Proposal, in which case the Adjournment Proposal will be the only proposal presented at the Extraordinary General Meeting or (ii) if the Board determines before the Extraordinary General Meeting that it is not necessary or no longer desirable to proceed with the proposals.\n\n3\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nYou are not being asked to vote on a business combination at this time. If the Extension is implemented and you do not elect to redeem your public shares, you will retain the right to vote on a business combination if and when it is submitted to shareholders and the right to redeem your public shares for cash in the event a business combination is approved and completed or the Company has not consummated a business combination by the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable.\n\nQ:What is the effect of giving a proxy?\n\nA:Proxies are solicited by and on behalf of our Board. Mitchell Cariaga and Lixin Zheng have been designated as proxies by our Board. When proxies are properly dated, executed and returned, the shares represented by such proxies will be voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting in accordance with the instructions of the shareholder. If no specific instructions are given, however, the shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of our Board as described below. If any matters not described in this proxy statement are properly presented at the Extraordinary General Meeting, the proxy holders will use their own judgment to determine how to vote the shares. If the Extraordinary General Meeting is adjourned, the proxy holders can vote the shares on the new Extraordinary General Meeting date as well, unless you have properly revoked your proxy instructions, as described elsewhere herein.\n\nQ:Can I attend the Extraordinary General Meeting?\n\nA:The Extraordinary General Meeting will be held at 12:00 PM, Eastern Time, on September 25, 2024. The Company has determined that the extraordinary general meeting will be a virtual meeting conducted exclusively via live webcast in order to facilitate shareholder attendance and participation. You or your proxyholder will be able to attend the virtual extraordinary general meeting online, vote, view the list of shareholders entitled to vote at the extraordinary general meeting and submit questions during the extraordinary general meeting by visiting https://www.cstproxy.com/oakwoodsacquisition/2024 and using a control number assigned by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, our Transfer Agent, where you will be able to listen to the meeting live and vote during the meeting. Additionally, you have the option to listen to the extraordinary general meeting by dialing +1 800-450-7155 (toll-free within the U.S. and Canada) or +1- 857-999-9155 (outside of the U.S. and Canada, standard rates apply). Please note that you cannot vote or ask questions if you choose to participate telephonically. Please note that you will only be able to access the extraordinary general meeting by means of remote communication. To register and receive access to the virtual meeting, registered shareholders and beneficial shareholders (those holding shares through a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other holder of record) will need to follow the instructions applicable to them provided in this proxy statement/prospectus. The record date for the extraordinary general meeting is September 4, 2024 (the “Record Date”). Only shareholders of record at the close of business on that date may attend and vote at the extraordinary general meeting or any adjournment thereof. A complete list of our shareholders of record entitled to attend and vote at the extraordinary general meeting will be available for ten days before the extraordinary general meeting at our principal executive offices for inspection by shareholders during ordinary business hours for any purpose germane to the extraordinary general meeting.\n\nEven if you plan to attend the Meeting, it is strongly recommended you complete and return your proxy card before the Meeting date, to ensure that your shares will be represented at the Meeting if you are unable to attend. You will not be required to attend the Meeting in person in order to vote. You may submit your proxy by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying pre-addressed postage-paid envelope. If you hold your shares in “street name,” which means your shares are held of record by a broker, bank or nominee, you should contact your broker, bank or nominee to ensure that votes related to the shares you beneficially own are properly counted. In this regard, you must provide the broker, bank or nominee with instructions on how to vote your shares.\n\nQ:Why should I vote to approve the Extension?\n\nA:Our Board believes shareholders will benefit from the Company consummating a business combination and is proposing the Extension to extend the date by which the Company has to complete a business combination until the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable. The Extension would give the Company the opportunity to complete a business combination.\n\n4\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nThe Charter currently provides that if the Company does not complete a business combination by September28, 2024, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable and up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Board, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in each case, to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law.\n\nWe believe that the provisions of the Charter described in the preceding paragraph were included to protect the Company’s shareholders from having to sustain their investments for an unreasonably long period if the Company failed to find a suitable business combination in the timeframe contemplated by the Charter. We also believe, however, that given the Company’s expenditure of time, effort and money on pursuing a business combination and our belief that a business combination offers an attractive investment for our shareholders, the Extension is warranted.\n\nIn connection with the Extension, public shareholders may elect to redeem their shares for a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes, divided by the number of then-issued and outstanding public shares, regardless of how such public shareholders vote on the Extension Proposal, or if they vote at all and regardless of whether they hold public shares on the Record Date.\n\nLiquidation of the Trust Account is a fundamental obligation of the Company to the public shareholders and the Company is not proposing and will not propose to change that obligation to the public shareholders. If holders of public shares do not elect to redeem their public shares, such holders shall retain redemption rights in connection with a business combination. Assuming the Extension is approved, the Company will have until the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable, to complete a business combination, unless the Company obtains any additional extension.\n\nOur Board recommends that you vote “FOR” the Extension Proposal, but expresses no opinion as to whether you should redeem your public shares.\n\nQ:Why should I vote to approve the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal?\n\nA:By eliminating from the Charter the Redemption Limitation, we allow the Company to redeem public shares, irrespective of whether such redemption would exceed the Redemption Limitation.\n\nThe purpose of such limitation was initially to ensure that the Company did not become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules. Because the public shares would not be deemed to be “penny stock” as such securities are listed on a national securities exchange, the Company is presenting the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal to facilitate the consummation of the Extension and a business combination.\n\nThe Board recommends that you vote “FOR” the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal.\n\nQ:Why should I vote to approve the Founder Share Amendment Proposal?\n\nA:The purpose of the Founder Share Amendment Proposal is to provide the holders of the Class B Ordinary Shares with the flexibility to assist the Company in retaining investors and meeting the listing requirements of its Class A Ordinary Shares if necessary or desirable in connection with the Extension and the consummation of the Company’s business combination. This flexibility may also aid the Company in retaining investors. If the Extension Proposal and the Founder Share Amendment Proposal are approved, the Sponsor has informed the Company that it expects to convert all of the Class B Ordinary Shares into Class A Ordinary Shares prior to any redemption described below. Notwithstanding the conversion, the Sponsor will not be entitled to receive any monies held in the Trust Account (as defined below) as a result of its ownership of any shares of Class A Ordinary Shares.\n\nThe Board recommends that you vote “FOR” the Founder Share Amendment Proposal.\n\n5\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nQ:Why should I vote to approve the Adjournment Proposal?\n\nA:If the Adjournment Proposal is presented and not approved by our shareholders, our Board may not be able to adjourn the Extraordinary General Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or convenient in the event that there are insufficient votes for the approval of the Extension Proposal, Founder Share Amendment Proposal, or Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal, or if we determine that additional time is necessary to effectuate the Extension, or if the Board determines before the Extraordinary General Meeting that it is not necessary or no longer desirable to proceed with the proposals.\n\nThe Board recommends that you vote “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.\n\nQ:How do the Company insiders intend to vote their shares?\n\nA:The Sponsor, the Company’s initial and current directors, officers and their permitted transferees (collectively, the “Insiders”) are expected to vote any Ordinary Shares over which they have voting control in favor of the Extension Proposal, the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal, the Founder Share Amendment Proposal, and the Adjournment Proposal.\n\nThe Insiders are not entitled to redeem any Ordinary Shares held by them. On the Record Date, the Insiders beneficially owned and were entitled to vote an aggregate of 1,780,625 Ordinary Shares, which represents approximately 23% of the Company’s issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares.\n\nSubject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), the Sponsor, the Company’s directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates may (i) purchase public shares from institutional and other investors (including those who vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against any of the proposals presented at the Extraordinary General Meeting, or elect to redeem, or indicate an intention to redeem, public shares), (ii) enter into transactions with such investors and others to provide them with incentives to not redeem their public shares, or (iii) execute agreements to purchase such public shares from such investors or enter into non-redemption agreements in the future. In the event that the Sponsor, the Company’s directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates purchase public shares in situations in which the tender offer rules restrictions on purchases would apply, they (a) would purchase the public shares at a price no higher than the price offered through the Company’s redemption process (i.e., approximately $11.04 per share, based on the amounts held in the Trust Account as of the Record Date (including interest not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes)); (b) would represent in writing that such public shares will not be voted in favor of approving the Extension; and (c) would waive in writing any redemption rights with respect to the public shares so purchased.\n\nTo the extent any such purchases by the Sponsor, the Company’s directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates are made in situations in which the tender offer rules restrictions on purchases apply, the Company will disclose in a Current Report on Form 8-K prior to the Extraordinary General Meeting the following: (i) the number of public shares purchased outside of the redemption offer, along with the purchase price(s) for such public shares; (ii) the purpose of any such purchases; (iii) the impact, if any, of the purchases on the likelihood that the Extension will be approved; (iv) the identities of the securityholders who sold to the Sponsor, the Company’s directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates (if not purchased on the open market) or the nature of the securityholders (e.g., 5% security holders) who sold such public shares; and (v) the number of Ordinary Shares for which the Company has received redemption requests pursuant to its redemption offer.\n\nThe purpose of such share purchases and other transactions would be to increase the likelihood of otherwise limiting the number of public shares electing to redeem.\n\nIf such transactions are effected, the consequence could be to cause the Extension to be effectuated in circumstances where such effectuation could not otherwise occur. Consistent with SEC guidance, purchases of shares by the persons described above would not be permitted to be voted for the Extension at the Extraordinary General Meeting and could decrease the chances that the Extension would be approved. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our securities and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.\n\n6\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nThe Company hereby represents that any Company securities purchased by the Sponsor, the Company’s directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates in situations in which the tender offer rules restrictions on purchases would apply would not be voted in favor of approving the Extension Proposal, the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal or the Founder Share Amendment Proposal.\n\nQ:Who is the Company’s Sponsor?\n\nA:The Company’s Sponsor is Whale Bay International Company Limited, a British Virgin Islands limited company. The Sponsor currently owns an aggregate of 343, 125 Class A ordinary Shares and 637,500 Class B Ordinary Shares. The Sponsor is controlled by Yadan Bai, the ultimate natural beneficial owner of the Sponsor, and has ultimate voting and dispositive power over the shares held by such entity and therefore may be deemed to be the ultimate beneficial owner of the securities held by such entity. Yadan Bai is also proposed to be a director of the Company assuming the successful contemplated business combination with Huajin.\n\nQ:What vote is required to approve the Extension Proposal?\n\nA:Approval of the Extension Proposal requires a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the Ordinary Shares which are represented in person or by proxy, or by corporate representative, or by corporate representative, and are voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting. The Extension Proposal is not conditioned on the approval of any other proposal.\n\nQ:What vote is required to approve the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal?\n\nA:Approval of the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal requires a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the Ordinary Shares which are represented in person or by proxy, or by corporate representative, or by corporate representative, and are voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting. The Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal is cross-conditioned on the approval of the Extension Proposal. Accordingly, even if the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal is approved, the Redemption Limitation Amendment will not be implemented if the Extension Proposal is not approved.\n\nQ:What vote is required to approve the Founder Share Amendment Proposal?\n\nA:Approval of the Founder Share Amendment Proposal requires a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the Ordinary Shares which are represented in person or by proxy, or by corporate representative, or by corporate representative, and are voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting. The Founder Share Amendment Proposal is cross-conditioned on the approval of the Extension Proposal. Accordingly, even if the Founder Share Amendment Proposal is approved, the Founder Share Amendment will not be implemented if the Extension Proposal is not approved.\n\nQ:What vote is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal?\n\nA:Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of a majority of the Ordinary Shares which are represented in person or by proxy, or by corporate representative, or by corporate representative, and are voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting. The Adjournment Proposal is not conditioned on the approval of any other proposal.\n\nQ:What happens if I sell my public shares or units before the Extraordinary General Meeting?\n\nA:The Record Date is earlier than the date of the Extraordinary General Meeting. If you transfer your public shares, including those shares held as a constituent part of our units, after the Record Date, but before the Extraordinary General Meeting, unless the transferee obtains from you a proxy to vote those shares, you will retain your right to vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting. If you transfer your public shares prior to the Record Date, you will have no right to vote those shares at the Extraordinary General Meeting. If you acquired your public shares after the Record Date, you will still have an opportunity to redeem them if you so decide.\n\nQ:What if I want to vote against or don’t want to vote for any of the proposals?\n\nA:If you do not want any of the proposals to be approved, you must abstain or vote against such proposal. A shareholder’s failure to vote by proxy or to vote in person at the Extraordinary General Meeting will not have an effect on any of the proposals because each proposal requires the vote of a percentage of the \n\n7\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nOrdinary Shares represented in person or by proxy and that are voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting. A shareholder’s failure to vote by proxy or to vote in person at the Extraordinary General Meeting will not be counted towards the number of Ordinary Shares required to validly establish a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted in connection with the determination of whether a valid quorum is established.\n\nQ:Will you seek any further extensions to consummate a business combination?\n\nA:Other than the extension until the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable, as described in this proxy statement, we do not currently anticipate seeking any further extension to consummate a business combination.\n\nQ:What happens if the Extension Proposal is not approved?\n\nA:If there are insufficient votes to approve the Extension Proposal, the Company may put the Adjournment Proposal to a vote in order to seek additional time to obtain sufficient votes in support of the Extension.\n\nIf the Extension Proposal is not approved and we do not consummate a business combination by September 28, 2024, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable and up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Board, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in each case, to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law.\n\nThe Insiders have agreed to waive their respective rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account in respect of any Class A or Class B Ordinary Shares held by it or them, as applicable, if the Company fails to complete a business combination by September 28, 2024, or by the applicable deadline as may be extended, although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Class A Ordinary Shares they hold if the Company fails to complete a business combination by such date. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, and rights which will expire worthless if we fail to complete a business combination by September28, 2024 or by the applicable deadline as may be extended.\n\nQ:If the Extension is approved, what happens next?\n\nA:The Company is continuing its efforts to complete a business combination.\n\nThe Company is seeking approval of the Extension because the Company will not be able to complete a business combination prior to September28, 2024. If the Extension is approved, the Company expects to continue working to complete its acquisition of Huajin.\n\nUpon approval of the Extension Proposal by the holders of at least two-thirds of the Ordinary Shares which are represented in person or by proxy, or by corporate representative, or by corporate representative, and are voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting, the Company will file an amendment to the Charter with the Cayman Islands Registrar of Companies (the “Cayman Registrar”) in the form attached as Annex A hereto. Upon approval of the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal by the holders of at least two-thirds of the Ordinary Shares which are represented in person or by proxy, or by corporate representative, or by corporate representative, and are voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting, the Company will file an amendment to the Charter with the Cayman Register in the form attached as Annex B hereto. Upon approval of the Founder Share Amendment Proposal by the holders of at least two-thirds of the Ordinary Shares which are represented in person or by proxy, or by corporate representative, or by corporate representative, and are voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting, the Company will file an amendment to the Charter with the Cayman Registrar in the form attached as Annex C hereto. The Company will remain a reporting company under the Exchange Act, and its units, Class A Ordinary Shares, public rights, and public warrants will remain publicly traded.\n\n8\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nIf the Extension is approved, any removal of any Withdrawal Amount (defined as an amount equal to the number of public shares properly redeemed multiplied by the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares) from the Trust Account will reduce the amount remaining in the Trust Account and increase the percentage interest of Ordinary Shares held by the Sponsor through the Class A and Class B Ordinary Shares.\n\nIf the Extension is approved, our Sponsor, will continue to have the right to receive payments from the Company of $10,000 per month for office space and secretarial and administrative services provided to members of our management team until the earlier of the Company’s consummation of a business combination or the Company’s liquidation pursuant to the Administrative Support Agreement, dated as of March 28, 2023 by and between the Company and its Sponsor (the “Administrative Support Agreement”).\n\nQ:What happens if the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal is not approved?\n\nA:If there are insufficient votes to approve the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal, the Company may put the Adjournment Proposal to a vote in order to seek additional time to obtain sufficient votes in support of the Redemption Limitation Amendment.\n\nIf the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal is not approved at the Extraordinary General Meeting or at any adjournment thereof, and there are significant requests for redemption such that the Redemption Limitation would be exceeded, the Redemption Limitation would prevent the Company from being able to consummate the Extension or a business combination. If the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal is not approved, we will not redeem public shares to the extent that accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would exceed the Redemption Limitation. In the event that the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal is not approved and we receive notice of redemptions of public shares approaching or in excess of the Redemption Limitation, we and/or the Sponsor may take action to increase our net tangible assets to avoid exceeding the Redemption Limitation.\n\nOur Insiders have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to the 637,500 Class B Ordinary Shares held by them.\n\nQ:What happens if the Founder Share Amendment Proposal is not approved?\n\nA:Our Board will abandon the Founder Share Amendment if our shareholders do not approve the Founder Share Amendment Proposal. If the Founder Share Amendment Proposal is not approved, we believe it may reduce our flexibility to maintain a listing of our Class A Ordinary Shares.\n\nQ:Where will I be able to find the voting results of the Extraordinary General Meeting?\n\nA:We will announce preliminary voting results at the Extraordinary General Meeting. We will also disclose voting results on a Current Report on Form 8-K that we will file with the SEC within four business days after the Extraordinary General Meeting. If final voting results are not available to us in time to file a Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days after the Extraordinary General Meeting, we will file a Current Report on Form 8-K to publish preliminary results and will provide the final results in an amendment to such Current Report on Form 8-K as soon as they become available.\n\nQ:Would I still be able to exercise my redemption rights in connection with a proposed business combination?\n\nA:Yes. Assuming you do not redeem your public shares in connection with the Extension, you will retain your right to redeem your public shares upon consummation of such business combination, subject to any limitations set forth in our Charter.\n\nQ:How do I change my vote?\n\nA:Shareholders may send a later-dated, signed proxy card to the Company at 101 Roswell Drive, Nepean, Ontario, K2J 0H5, Canada, Attn: Lixin Zheng Chief Executive Officer, so that it is received prior to the vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting (which is scheduled to take place on September25, 2024). Shareholders also may revoke their proxy by sending a notice of revocation to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, which must be received prior to the vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting, or by attending the \n\n9\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nExtraordinary General Meeting, revoking their proxy and voting in person. However, if your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or another nominee, you must contact your broker, bank or other nominee to change your vote.\n\nQ:How are votes counted?\n\nA:Votes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for the meeting, who will separately count “FOR” and “AGAINST” votes, abstentions and broker non-votes for each of the proposals. A shareholder’s failure to vote by proxy or to vote in person at the meeting will not be counted towards the number of Ordinary Shares required to validly establish a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted in connection with the determination of whether a valid quorum is established.\n\nQ:What is a quorum?\n\nA:A quorum is the minimum number of shares required to be present at the Extraordinary General Meeting for the Extraordinary General Meeting to be properly held under our Charter. The presence, in person, by proxy, or if a corporation or other non-natural person, by its duly authorized representative or proxy, of the holders of at least one-third of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares entitled to vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting constitutes a quorum. Proxies that are marked “abstain” and proxies relating to “street name” shares that are returned to us but marked by brokers as “not voted” (so-called “broker non-votes”) will be treated as shares present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum on all matters. If a shareholder does not give the broker voting instructions, under applicable self-regulatory organization rules, its broker may not vote its shares on “non-discretionary” matters. We believe that each of the proposals is a “non-discretionary” matter.\n\nQ:If my shares are held in “street name,” will my broker automatically vote them for me?\n\nA:If you do not give instructions to your broker, your broker can vote your shares with respect to “discretionary” items, but not with respect to “non-discretionary” items. We believe that each of the proposals are “non-discretionary” items.\n\nYour broker can vote your shares with respect to “non-discretionary” items only if you provide instructions on how to vote. You should instruct your broker how to vote your shares. Your broker can tell you how to provide these instructions. If you do not give your broker instructions, your shares will be treated as broker non-votes with respect to all proposals. Abstentions and broker non-votes, while considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum, will not count as votes cast at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\n\nQ:Who can vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting?\n\nA:Holders of our Ordinary Shares as of the close of business on September 4, 2024, the Record Date, are entitled to vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were 5,750,000 OAKU public Class A Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote. OAKU’s Sponsor and Initial Shareholders own an aggregate of 343,125 OAKU Class A Ordinary Shares and an aggregate of 1,437,500 OAKU Class B Ordinary Shares. In deciding all matters at the Extraordinary General Meeting, each shareholder will be entitled to one vote for each share held by them on the Record Date. Holders of Class A Ordinary Shares and holders of Class B Ordinary Shares will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders except as required by law or our Charter. The Insiders holding Class A and Class B Ordinary Shares constitute approximately 23.7% of our issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares.\n\nRegistered Shareholders.If our Ordinary Shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Continental, you are considered the shareholder of record with respect to those shares. As the shareholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to the individuals listed on the proxy card or to vote in person at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\n\nStreet Name Shareholders.If our Ordinary Shares are held on your behalf in a brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of those shares held in “street name,” and your broker or nominee is considered the shareholder of record with respect to those shares. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or nominee as to how to vote your shares. However, since a beneficial owner is not the shareholder of record, you may not vote your Ordinary Shares at the Extraordinary General Meeting unless you follow your broker’s procedures for obtaining a legal proxy. Throughout this proxy, we refer to shareholders who hold their shares through a broker, bank or other nominee as “street name shareholders.”\n\n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nQ:Does the Board recommend voting for the approval of the proposals?\n\nA:Yes. After careful consideration of the terms and conditions of these proposals, the Board has determined that each of the proposals are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Board recommends that the Company’s shareholders vote “FOR” each of the proposals.\n\nQ:What interests do the Sponsor and the Company’s directors and officers have in the approval of the proposals?\n\nA:The Sponsor and the Company’s directors and officers have interests in the proposals that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a shareholder. These interests include ownership of Class B Ordinary Shares, the ownership of the private placement Warrants and private placement Rights held by our Sponsor that may become exercisable in the future and the possibility of future compensatory arrangements. See the section entitled “Proposal No. 1 — The Extension Proposal — Interests of the Sponsor and the Company’s Directors and Officers.”\n\nQ:Are there any dissenter’s or appraisal or similar rights for dissenting shareholders?\n\nA:Shareholders of the Company do not have dissenters’ rights in connection with any of the Proposals under Cayman Islands law.\n\nQ:What happens to the Company’s warrants and rights if the Extension is not approved?\n\nA:If the Extension is not approved and we do not consummate a business combination by September 28, 2024, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable and up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Board, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in each case, to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, and rights which will expire worthless if we fail to complete a business combination by September28, 2024 or by the applicable deadline as may be extended.\n\nQ:What happens to the Company’s warrants and rights if the Extension is approved?\n\nA:If the Extension is approved, the Company will continue to attempt to consummate a business combination until the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable, and will retain the blank check company restrictions previously applicable to it. The warrants and rights will remain outstanding in accordance with their terms.\n\nQ:How are the funds in the Trust Account currently being held?\n\nA:With respect to the regulation of special purpose acquisition companies (“SPACs”) like the Company, on January24, 2024, the SEC issued the final rules (the “2024 SPAC Rules”) relating to, among other items, the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, including a proposed rule that would provide SPACs a safe harbor from treatment as an investment company if they satisfy certain conditions that limit a SPAC’s duration, asset composition, business purpose and activities.\n\nIt is possible that a claim could be made that we have been operating as an unregistered investment company, including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, based on the current views of the SEC. While the funds in the Trust Account have, since the Company’s IPO, been held only in U.S. government securities within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or money market funds meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, to mitigate the risk of being viewed as operating as an unregistered investment \n\n11\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\ncompany (including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act), we will, on or prior to the 24-month anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement relating to our IPO, instruct Continental, the trustee with respect to the Trust Account, to liquidate the U.S. government securities or money market funds held in the Trust Account and, thereafter, to hold all funds in the Trust Account in a bank deposit account until the earlier of the consummation of a business combination or our liquidation. Interest on bank deposit accounts is variable and such accounts currently yield interest of approximately 3.0% per annum. The Trust Account is currently held at J.P. Securities.\n\nIn addition, even prior to the 24-month anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement relating to our IPO, we may be deemed to be an investment company. The longer that the funds in the Trust Account are held in short-term U.S. government securities or in money market funds invested exclusively in such securities, even prior to the 24-month anniversary, there is a greater risk that we may be considered an unregistered investment company, in which case we may be required to liquidate. For more information, see the section entitled “Risk Factors — If we are deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we may be forced to abandon our efforts to complete a business combination and instead be required to liquidate the Company. To mitigate the risk of that result, on or prior to the 24-month anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement relating to our IPO, we will instruct Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company to liquidate the securities held in the Trust Account and instead hold all funds in the Trust Account in a variable interest bearing account.”\n\nQ:How do I vote?\n\nA:If you are a holder of record of Ordinary Shares on September 4, 2024 the Record Date for the Extraordinary General Meeting, you may vote in person at the Extraordinary General Meeting or by submitting a proxy for the Extraordinary General Meeting. You may submit your proxy by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying pre-addressed postage-paid envelope. If you hold your shares in “street name,” which means your shares are held of record by a broker, bank or nominee, you should contact your broker, bank or nominee to ensure that votes related to the shares you beneficially own are properly counted. In this regard, you must provide the broker, bank or nominee with instructions on how to vote your shares or, if you wish to attend the Extraordinary General Meeting and vote in person, obtain a valid proxy from your broker, bank or nominee.\n\nQ:How do I redeem my Ordinary Shares?\n\nA:Pursuant to the Charter, a public shareholder may request that the Company redeem all or a portion of such public shareholder’s public shares for cash if the Extension Proposal or the Founder Share Amendment Proposal is approved. You will be entitled to receive cash for any public shares to be redeemed only if you:\n\n(i)(a) hold public shares or (b) hold public shares as part of units and elect to separate such units into the underlying public shares, public rights, and public warrants prior to exercising your redemption rights with respect to the public shares; and\n\n(ii)prior to 12:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on September 23, 2024 (two business days prior to the vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting), (a) submit a written request to Continental, the Company’s transfer agent, that the Company redeem your public shares for cash and (b) tender or deliver your public shares (and share certificates (if any) and other redemption forms) to the transfer agent, physically or electronically through The Depository Trust Company.\n\nHolders of units must elect to separate the underlying public shares, public rights, and public warrants prior to exercising redemption rights with respect to the public shares. If holders hold their units in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, holders must notify their broker or bank that they elect to separate the units into the underlying public shares, public rights, and public warrants, or if a holder holds units registered in its own name, the holder must contact the transfer agent directly and instruct it to do so. Public shareholders may elect to redeem all or a portion of their public shares regardless of whether they vote for or against the Extension Proposal, or do not vote at all, and regardless of whether they hold the public shares on the Record Date.\n\n12\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nBased upon the amount held in the Trust Account as of the Record Date (including interest not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes), the Company estimates that the per-share price at which public shares may be redeemed from cash held in the Trust Account will be approximately $11.04 at the time of the Extraordinary General Meeting. The closing price of one Class A Ordinary Share on the Record Date was $11.03. Accordingly, if the market price were to remain the same until the date of the Extraordinary General Meeting, exercising redemption rights would result in a public shareholder receiving approximately $0.01 more per share than if such shareholder sold its public shares in the open market. The Company cannot assure shareholders that they will be able to sell their Class A Ordinary Shares in the open market, even if the market price per share is higher than the redemption price stated above, as there may not be sufficient liquidity in its securities when such shareholders wish to sell their shares.\n\nQ:What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?\n\nA:You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards, if your shares are registered in more than one name or are registered in different accounts. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. Please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive in order to cast a vote with respect to all of your shares.\n\nQ:Who is paying for this proxy solicitation?\n\nA:Our Board is soliciting proxies for use at the Extraordinary General Meeting. All costs associated with this solicitation will be borne directly by the Company. We will reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries representing beneficial owners of Class A Ordinary Shares for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to beneficial owners of Class A Ordinary Shares and in obtaining voting instructions from those owners. Our directors and officers may also solicit proxies by telephone, by facsimile, by mail, on the Internet or in person. They will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.\n\nQ:Who can help answer my questions?\n\nA:If you have questions about the Extraordinary General Meeting or the proposals to be presented thereat, if you need additional copies of the proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card, or if you would like copies of any of the Company’s filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, you should contact:\n\nOak Woods Acquisition Corporation101 Roswell Drive, Nepean, Ontario,K2J 0H5, CanadaTelephone: (+1) 403-561-7750\n\nYou may also obtain additional information about the Company from documents filed with the SEC by following the instructions in the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information.”\n\nIf you are a holder of public shares and you intend to seek redemption of your shares, you will need to deliver your public shares (and share certificates (if any) and other redemption forms) (either physically or electronically) to the transfer agent at the address below prior to 12:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on September 23, 2024 (two business days prior to the vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting). If you have questions regarding the certification of your position or tendering/delivery of your shares, please contact:\n\nSPAC Redemption TeamContinental Stock Transfer & Trust Company1 State Street, 30 FloorNew York, New York 10004E-mail: spacredemptions@continentalstock.com\n\n13\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nYou should consider carefully all of the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024, and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 filed with the SEC on August 13, 2024, and in the other reports we file with the SEC before making a decision to vote on the proposals described in this proxy statement or to invest in our securities. Furthermore, if any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected or we could face liquidation. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described in the aforementioned filings and below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results or result in our liquidation.\n\nThere are no assurances that the Extension will enable us to complete a business combination.\n\nApproving the Extension involves a number of risks. Even if the Extension is approved, the Company can provide no assurances that a business combination will be consummated prior to the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable. Our ability to consummate a business combination is dependent on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control.\n\nWe are required to offer shareholders the opportunity to redeem public shares in connection with the Extension Proposal and the Founder Share Amendment Proposal, and we will be required to offer shareholders redemption rights again in connection with any shareholder vote to approve a business combination. Even if the Extension or a business combination are approved by our shareholders, it is possible that redemptions will leave us with insufficient cash to consummate a business combination on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. The fact that we will have separate redemption periods in connection with the Extension Proposal and a business combination vote could exacerbate these risks. Other than in connection with a redemption offer, our shareholders may be unable to recover their investment except through sales of our Ordinary Shares on the open market. The price of our Ordinary Shares may be volatile, and there can be no assurance that shareholders will be able to dispose of our Ordinary Shares at favorable prices, or at all.\n\nWhile it is unlikely that our transaction will be subject to U.S. foreign investment regulations and review by a U.S. government entity such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”), or ultimately prohibited by any U.S. foreign investment authority, we are subject to the ongoing review of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the development of new laws, regulations and regulatory interpretations relating to the registration and sale of our securities in the U.S.\n\nOur Sponsor, Whale Bay International Company Limited, is currently controlled by Ms. Yadan Bai, a PRC resident, and will own approximately 4.2% to 5.1% of our outstanding shares following the close of our proposed business combination, in the event that our public shareholders respectively redeem none or all of their shares. Huajin is currently controlled by Mr. Xuehong Li, a PRC resident, and will own or control the voting power of our outstanding shares following the close of our proposed business combination assuming full redemption of all of our public shares. As such, we will as of the date of the business combination be considered a domestic issuer with substantial foreign ownership and control. However, because we are a non U.S. business acquiring a foreign business that has no operations or nexus with the U.S. market apart from the proposed business combination, it is unlikely that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) or any other U.S. government entity apart from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will review the transaction. We remain subject to the risk of potentially adverse new laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof in the U.S. concerning the registration and sale of our securities in the U.S and globally. The process of government review, whether by CFIUS or otherwise, could be lengthy. Because we have only a limited time to complete our business combination, our failure to obtain any required approvals within the requisite time period may require us to liquidate. If we are unable to consummate our business combination by the Current Outside Date, the Extended Date or the Additional Extended Date, as applicable, including as a result of extended regulatory review, we will redeem the public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account and as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our Board, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in each case, to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In such event, our shareholders will miss the opportunity to benefit from an investment in a target company and the potential appreciation in value of such investment. Additionally, our warrants and rights will become worthless.\n\n14\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nThe SEC has recently issued final rules relating to certain activities of SPACs. Certain of the procedures that the Company or others may determine to undertake in connection with such rules may increase our costs and the time needed to complete the Business Combination.\n\nOn January24, 2024, the SEC issued final rules (the “2024 SPAC Rules”), effective on July1, 2024, that formally adopted some of the SEC’s proposed rules for SPACs that were released on March30, 2022. The 2024 SPAC Rules, among other items, impose additional disclosure requirements in initial public offerings by SPACs and business combination transactions involving SPACs and private operating companies; amend the financial statement requirements applicable to business combination transactions involving such companies; update and expand guidance regarding the general use of projections in SEC filings, including requiring disclosure of all material bases of the projections and all material assumptions underlying the projections; increase the potential liability of certain participants in proposed business combination transactions; and could impact the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act. Such rules may materially adversely affect our business, including our ability to complete, and the costs associated with, the Business Combination, and results of operations.\n\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we may be forced to abandon our efforts to complete a business combination and instead be required to liquidate the Company. To mitigate the risk of that result, on or prior to the 24-month anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement relating to our IPO, we will instruct Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company to liquidate the securities held in the Trust Account and instead hold all funds in the Trust Account in a variable interest bearing account.\n\nAs described further above, the 2024 SPAC Rules relate, among other matters, to the circumstances in which SPACs such as the Company could potentially be subject to the Investment Company Act and the regulations thereunder. In the adopting release for the 2024 SPAC Rules, the SEC provided guidance that a SPAC’s potential status as an “investment company” depends on a variety of factors, such as a SPAC’s duration, asset composition, business purpose and activities and “is a question of facts and circumstances” requiring individualized analysis. If we were deemed to be subject to compliance with and regulation under the Investment Company Act, we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and expenses for which we have not allotted funds. Unless we are able to modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we would either register as an investment company or wind down and abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead to liquidate the Company.\n\nAs such, if we fail to complete our business combination with Huajin by March28, 2025, we will be at significant risk of being deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act and our activities would be severely restricted. In addition, we would be subject to burdensome compliance requirements. We do not believe that our principal activities to date or in contemplation of this proxy solicitation will subject us to regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. However, if we are deemed to be an investment company and subject to compliance with and regulation under the Investment Company Act, we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and expenses for which we have not allotted funds. As a result, unless we are able to modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we may abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead liquidate the Company. Were we to liquidate, our rights and warrants would expire worthless, and our securityholders would lose the investment opportunity associated with an investment in the prospective combined company, including any potential price appreciation of our securities.\n\nThe funds in the Trust Account have, since our IPO, been held only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. government treasury obligations and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. As of the Record Date, amounts held in Trust Account included approximately $63,495,783.48million of accrued interest. To mitigate the risk of us being deemed to have been operating as an unregistered investment company under the Investment Company Act, we will, on or prior to the 24-month anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement relating to our IPO, instruct Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the trustee with respect to the Trust Account, to liquidate the U.S. government securities or money market funds held in the Trust Account and, thereafter, to hold all funds in the Trust Account in a bank deposit account until the earlier of the consummation of our business combination or our liquidation. Interest on bank deposit accounts is variable and such accounts currently yield interest of approximately 3.0% per annum.\n\n15\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nIn addition, even prior to the 24-month anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement relating to our IPO, we may be deemed to be an investment company. The longer that the funds in the Trust Account are held in short-term U.S. government securities or in money market funds invested exclusively in such securities, even prior to the 24-month anniversary, there is a greater risk that we may be considered an unregistered investment company, in which case we may be required to liquidate.\n\nThe new 1% U.S. federal excise tax on stock buybacks could be imposed on redemptions of our Ordinary Shares if we were to become a “covered corporation” in the future.\n\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IR Act”), which, among other things, generally imposes a 1% U.S. federal excise tax (the “Excise Tax”) on certain repurchases of stock by “covered corporations” (which include publicly traded domestic (i.e., U.S.) corporations and certain domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign (i.e., non-U.S.) corporations) occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The Excise Tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which the stock is repurchased. The amount of the Excise Tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the Excise Tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the Excise Tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) has authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out, and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the Excise Tax. On December 27, 2022, the Treasury issued a notice that provides interim operating rules for the Excise Tax, including rules governing the calculation and reporting of the Excise Tax, on which taxpayers may rely until the forthcoming proposed Treasury regulations addressing the Excise Tax are published. Although such notice clarifies certain aspects of the Excise Tax, the interpretation and operation of other aspects of the Excise Tax remain unclear, and such interim operating rules are subject to change.\n\nWe are currently not a covered corporation for purposes of the Excise Tax. If we were to become a covered corporation in the future, whether in connection with the consummation of our business combination with a U.S. company (including if we were to redomicile as a U.S. corporation in connection therewith) or otherwise, whether and to what extent we would be subject to the Excise Tax on a redemption of our Ordinary Shares would depend on a number of factors, including (i) whether the redemption is treated as a repurchase of stock for purposes of the Excise Tax, (ii) the fair market value of the redemption treated as a repurchase of stock, (iii) the structure of our business combination, (iv) the nature and amount of any “PIPE” or other equity issuances (whether in connection with our business combination or otherwise) issued within the same taxable year of a redemption treated as a repurchase of stock and (v) the content of forthcoming regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. As noted above, the Excise Tax would be payable by the repurchasing corporation, and not by the redeeming holder, and only limited guidance on the mechanics of any required reporting and payment of the Excise Tax on which taxpayers may rely have been issued to date. If we were to become a covered corporation in the future, the per-share redemption amount payable from the Trust Account (including any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account) to our public shareholders in connection with a redemption of our Ordinary Shares is not expected to be reduced by any Excise Tax imposed on us. The imposition of the Excise Tax on us could, however, cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete our business combination and may affect our ability to complete our business combination or fund future operations.\n\nNasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange following redemptions by our shareholders in connection with approval of the Extension Proposal, which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\n\nOur Class A Ordinary Shares, units, rights and warrants are listed on Nasdaq. After the Extraordinary General Meeting, we may be required to demonstrate compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements in order to maintain the listing of our securities on Nasdaq. Such continued listing requirements for our public shares include, among other things, the requirement to maintain at least 400 public holders, at least 1.1 million publicly held shares and the Market Value of Listed Securities (as defined in Nasdaq Rule 5005) of at least $50 million, and a market value of publicly held shares of $15 million (as defined in Nasdaq Rule 5005). Pursuant to the terms of our Charter, in connection with the Extension Proposal and the Founder Share Amendment Proposal, shareholders may elect to redeem their public shares and, as a result, we may not be in compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements.\n\n16\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nIf our securities do not meet Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements, Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange. If Nasdaq delists any of our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list such securities on another approved national securities exchange, we expect that such securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: (i) a limited availability of market quotations for our securities, (ii) reduced liquidity for our securities, (iii) a determination that our public shares are a “penny stock” which will require brokers trading in our public shares to adhere to more stringent rules, including being subject to the depository requirements of Rule 419 of the Securities Act, and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities, (iv) a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future, and (v) a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business in connection with a business combination.\n\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as “covered securities.” Our public shares, units, rights, and warrants qualify as covered securities under such statute. If we were no longer listed on Nasdaq, our securities would not qualify as covered securities under such statute and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\n\n17\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nTHE EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING\n\nAt the Extraordinary General Meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on proposals to:\n\n1.Proposal No. 1 — The Extension Proposal — as a special resolution, to amend the Company’s Charter pursuant to an amendment to the Charter in the form set forth in Annex A to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination from the Current Outside Date to the Extended Date and to allow the Company, without another shareholder vote, by resolution of the Board, to elect to further extend the Extended Date in three-month increments up to 1 additional time, or a total of up to six months after the Current Outside Date, until up to March 28, 2025; and\n\n2.Proposal No. 2 — The Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal — as a special resolution, to amend the Charter pursuant to an amendment to the Charter in the form set forth in Annex B to eliminate from the Charter (i) the limitation that the Company may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause the Company’s net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and (ii) the limitation that the Company shall not consummate a business combination unless the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately prior to, or upon consummation of, or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement that may be contained in the agreement relating to, such business combination;\n\n3.Proposal No. 3 — The Founder Share Amendment Proposal — as a special resolution, to amend the Charter pursuant to an amendment to the Charter in the form set forth in Annex C to provide for the right of a holder of the Company’s Class B Ordinary Shares to convert into Class A Ordinary Shares on a one-for-one basis at any time and from time to time prior to the closing of a business combination at the election of the holder;\n\n4.Proposal No. 4 — The Adjournment Proposal — as an ordinary resolution, to approve the adjournment of the Extraordinary General Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or convenient, (i) to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies in the event that there are insufficient votes for, or otherwise in connection with, the Extension Proposal, the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal or the Founder Share Amendment Proposal, or if we otherwise determine that additional time is necessary to effectuate the Extension which will only be presented at the Extraordinary General Meeting if, based on the tabulated votes, there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Extraordinary General Meeting to approve the Extension Proposal, the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal or the Founder Share Amendment Proposal, in which case the Adjournment Proposal will be the only proposal presented at the Extraordinary General Meeting or (ii) if the Board determines before the Extraordinary General Meeting that it is not necessary or no longer desirable to proceed with the proposals.\n\nIf the Extension Proposal is approved and the Extension is implemented, the Sponsor or its designees will deposit into the Trust Account as a Contribution, (i) on or before September28, 2024, with respect to the extension to the Extended Date, an amount equal to $230,000, and (ii) one business day following the public announcement by the Company disclosing that the Board has determined to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination for an additional month, with respect to the extension to each such Additional Extended Date, an amount equal to $230,000, in each case in accordance with the Extension. The maximum aggregate amount of Contributions will be $460,000. The Contributions will be evidenced by the Contribution Note, which is a non-interest bearing, unsecured convertible promissory note repayable by the Company upon consummation of a business combination. Such loans may be converted into warrants of the post-business combination entity, which shall have terms identical to the private placement warrants sold concurrently with the IPO, each exercisable for one Class A Ordinary Share at a purchase price of $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the Contributor. If the Company does not consummate a business combination by the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable, any such promissory notes will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. Any Contribution is conditioned on the approval of the Extension Proposal and the implementation of the Extension. No Contribution will occur if the Extension Proposal is not approved or the Extension is not implemented. If the Company has consummated a business combination or announced its intention to wind up prior to any Contribution Date, any obligation to make Contributions will terminate.\n\n18\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nVoting Power; Record Date\n\nOnly shareholders of record of the Company as of the close of business on September 4, 2024, the Record Date, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Extraordinary General Meeting or any adjournments and/or postponements thereof. Each Ordinary Share entitles the holder thereof to one vote. If your shares are held in “street name” or are in a margin or similar account, you should contact your broker to ensure that votes related to the shares you beneficially own are properly counted. On the Record Date, there were 7,530,625 Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding, including 6,093,125 Class A Ordinary Shares and 1,437,500 Class B Ordinary Shares. The Company’s warrants and rights do not have voting rights in connection with the proposals.\n\nQuorum and Vote of Shareholders\n\nA quorum is the minimum number of shares required to be present at the Extraordinary General Meeting for the Extraordinary General Meeting to be properly held under our Charter. The presence, in person, by proxy, or if a corporation or other non-natural person, by its duly authorized representative or proxy, of the holders of at least one-third of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares entitled to vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting constitutes a quorum. Proxies that are marked “abstain” and proxies relating to “street name” shares that are returned to us but marked by brokers as “not voted” (so-called “broker non-votes”) will be treated as shares present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum on all matters. If a shareholder does not give the broker voting instructions, under applicable self-regulatory organization rules, its broker may not vote its shares on “non-discretionary” matters. We believe each of the proposals constitutes a “non-discretionary” matter.\n\nVotes Required\n\nApproval of each of the Extension Proposal, the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal and the Founder Share Amendment Proposal requires a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the Ordinary Shares which are represented in person or by proxy, or by corporate representative, or by corporate representative, and are voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes, while considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum, will not count as votes cast at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\n\nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal requires an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of a majority of the Ordinary Shares which are represented in person or by proxy, or by corporate representative, or by corporate representative, and are voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes, while considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum, will not count as votes cast at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\n\nIf you do not want any of the proposals to be approved, you must abstain, not vote or vote against such proposal. A shareholder’s failure to vote by proxy or to vote in person at the Extraordinary General Meeting will not be counted towards the number of Ordinary Shares required to validly establish a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted in connection with the determination of whether a valid quorum is established.\n\nVoting\n\nOur Board is asking for your proxy. Giving our Board your proxy means you authorize it to vote your shares at the Extraordinary General Meeting in the manner you direct. You may vote for or against the proposal or you may abstain from voting. All valid proxies received prior to the Extraordinary General Meeting will be voted. All shares represented by a proxy will be voted, and where a shareholder specifies by means of the proxy a choice with respect to any matter to be acted upon, the shares will be voted in accordance with the specification so made. If no choice is indicated on the proxy, the shares will be voted “FOR” each of the proposals and as the proxy holders may determine in their discretion with respect to any other matters that may properly come before the Extraordinary General Meeting.\n\nYou can vote your shares at the Extraordinary General Meeting in person or by proxy. You may submit your proxy by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying pre-addressed postage-paid envelope. If you hold your shares in “street name,” which means your shares are held of record by a broker, bank or nominee, you should contact your broker, bank or nominee to ensure that votes related to the shares you beneficially own are properly counted. In this regard, you must provide the broker, bank or nominee with instructions on how to vote your shares or, if you wish to attend the Extraordinary General Meeting and vote in person, obtain a valid proxy from your broker, bank or nominee.\n\n19\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nProxies that are marked “abstain” and proxies relating to “street name” shares that are returned to us but marked by brokers as “not voted” (so-called “broker non-votes”) will be treated as shares present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum on all matters. If a shareholder does not give the broker voting instructions, under applicable self-regulatory organization rules, its broker may not vote its shares on “non-discretionary” matters. We believe each of the proposals constitutes a “non-discretionary” matter.\n\nRevocability of Proxies\n\nShareholders may send a later-dated, signed proxy card to the Company at 101 Roswell Drive, Nepean, Ontario, K2J 0H5, Canada, Attn: Lixin Zheng Chief Executive Officer, so that it is received prior to the vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting (which is scheduled to take place on September25, 2024) or attend the Extraordinary General Meeting in person and vote. Shareholders also may revoke their proxy by sending a notice of revocation to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, which must be received prior to the vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting. However, if your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank or another nominee, you must contact your broker, bank or other nominee to change your vote.\n\nAttendance at the Extraordinary General Meeting\n\nThe Extraordinary General Meeting will be held at 12:00 AM, Eastern Time, on September 25, 2024. The Company has determined that the extraordinary general meeting will be a virtual meeting conducted exclusively via live webcast in order to facilitate shareholder attendance and participation. You or your proxyholder will be able to attend the virtual extraordinary general meeting online, vote, view the list of shareholders entitled to vote at the extraordinary general meeting and submit questions during the extraordinary general meeting by visiting https://www.cstproxy.com/oakwoodsacquisition/2024 and using a control number assigned by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, our Transfer Agent, where you will be able to listen to the meeting live and vote during the meeting. Additionally, you have the option to listen to the extraordinary general meeting by dialing +1 800-450-7155 (toll-free within the U.S. and Canada) or +1- 857-999-9155 (outside of the U.S. and Canada, standard rates apply). Please note that you cannot vote or ask questions if you choose to participate telephonically. Please note that you will only be able to access the extraordinary general meeting by means of remote communication. To register and receive access to the virtual meeting, registered shareholders and beneficial shareholders (those holding shares through a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other holder of record) will need to follow the instructions applicable to them provided in this proxy statement/prospectus. The record date for the extraordinary general meeting is September 4, 2024 (the “Record Date”). Only shareholders of record at the close of business on that date may attend and vote at the extraordinary general meeting or any adjournment thereof. A complete list of our shareholders of record entitled to attend and vote at the extraordinary general meeting will be available for ten days before the extraordinary general meeting at our principal executive offices for inspection by shareholders during ordinary business hours for any purpose germane to the extraordinary general meeting.\n\nEven if you plan to attend the Meeting, it is strongly recommended you complete and return your proxy card before the Meeting date, to ensure that your shares will be represented at the Meeting if you are unable to attend. You will not be required to attend the Meeting in person in order to vote.\n\nYou may submit your proxy by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying pre-addressed postage-paid envelope. If you hold your shares in “street name,” which means your shares are held of record by a broker, bank or nominee, you should contact your broker, bank or nominee to ensure that votes related to the shares you beneficially own are properly counted. In this regard, you must provide the broker, bank or nominee with instructions on how to vote your shares or, if you wish to attend the Extraordinary General Meeting and vote in person, obtain a valid proxy from your broker, bank or nominee.\n\nSolicitation of Proxies\n\nThe Company is soliciting proxies for use at the Extraordinary General Meeting. All costs associated with this solicitation will be borne directly by the Company. We will reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries representing beneficial owners of Class A Ordinary Shares for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to beneficial owners of Class A Ordinary Shares and in obtaining voting instructions from those owners. Our directors and officers may also solicit proxies by telephone, by facsimile, by mail, on the Internet or in person. They will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.\n\n20\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nSome banks and brokers have customers who beneficially own Ordinary Shares listed of record in the names of nominees. We intend to request banks and brokers to solicit such customers and will reimburse them for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for such solicitations. If any additional solicitation of the holders of our outstanding Ordinary Shares is deemed necessary, we (through our directors and officers) anticipate making such solicitation directly.\n\nDissenters’ Rights of Appraisal\n\nShareholders of the Company do not have dissenters’ rights in connection with any of the proposals under Cayman Islands law.\n\nShareholder Proposals\n\nNo business may be transacted at any annual general meeting or extraordinary general meeting other than business that is either (i) specified in the notice of the general meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the directors of the Company or (ii) otherwise properly brought before the general meeting in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Charter.\n\nOther Business\n\nThe Board does not know of any other matters to be presented at the Extraordinary General Meeting. If any additional matters are properly presented at the Extraordinary General Meeting, the persons named in the enclosed proxy card will have discretion to vote the shares they represent in accordance with their own judgment on such matters.\n\nPrincipal Executive Offices\n\nOur principal executive offices are located at 01 Roswell Drive, Nepean, Ontario, K2J 0H5, Canada; telephone: (+1) 403-561-7750\n\n21\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nPROPOSAL NO. 1 — THE EXTENSION PROPOSAL\n\nBackground\n\nOn March 28, 2023, the Company consummated its IPO of 5,750,000 units (the “Public Units”), which includes the full exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option of 750,000 Public Units. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A Ordinary Share (“Class A Ordinary Share”), one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”) entitling its holder to purchase one share of Class A Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per share, and one right (“Right”) to receive one-sixth (1/6) of a share of Class A Ordinary Share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Public Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Public Unit, generating gross proceeds of $57,500,000. As of March 28, 2023, a total of $58,506,250 of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement (as defined below) were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (“Continental”) acting as trustee. Our Charter provides for the return of the IPO proceeds held in the Trust Account to the holders of public shares if we do not complete a business combination by September 28, 2024.\n\nSimultaneously with the closing of the IPO on March 28, 2023, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with Whale Bay International Company Limited, our sponsor (the “Sponsor,”) purchasing units (the “Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $3,431,810.\n\nOn October 25, 2022, we issued an aggregate of 2,156,250 founder shares to our initial shareholders for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000 in cash, or approximately $0.012 per share. On February 10, 2023, our Sponsor surrendered, and we cancelled, an aggregate of 718,750 Class B Ordinary Shares held by our Sponsor pursuant to a share surrender agreement dated January 13, 2023. As a result, as of February 10, 2023 there were 1,437,500 founders shares issued and outstanding, resulting in an aggregate purchase price per share of approximately $0.017. The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding Ordinary Shares upon completion of our IPO. The founder shares (including the Class A Ordinary Shares issuable upon conversion thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder.\n\nWhile the Company is currently proceeding with the filing of its preliminary and definitive proxy solicitation statements concerning the acquisition of Huajin (China) Holdings Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted holding company (“Huajin”), as described further in its third amended preliminary prospectus and proxy statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 20, 2024, the Board has determined that there may not be sufficient time before the Current Outside Date to complete a business combination. Accordingly, the Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company’s shareholders to extend the date by which the Company has to complete a business combination to the Extended Date or the Additional Extended Date, as applicable.\n\nThe Extension\n\nWe are proposing to amend the Charter by special resolution pursuant to an amendment to the Charter in the form set forth in Annex A hereof to extend the date by which the Company must consummate its business combination from the Current Outside Date to the Extended Date, and to allow the Company, without another shareholder vote, by resolution of the Board, to elect to further extend the Extended Date in three-month increments up to the Additional Extended Date.\n\nReasons for the Proposal\n\nThe Charter provides that we have 18 months, or until September 28, 2023, to complete a business combination. While the Company is currently proceeding with the filing of its preliminary and definitive proxy solicitation statements concerning the acquisition of Huajin (China) Holdings Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted holding company (“Huajin”), as described further in its third amended preliminary prospectus and proxy statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 20, 2024, the Board has determined that there may not be sufficient time before the Current Outside Date to complete a business combination. Accordingly, the Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company’s shareholders to extend the date by which the Company has to complete a business combination to the Extended Date or the Additional Extended Date, as applicable.\n\n22\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nThe Charter currently provides that if the Company does not complete a business combination by September 28, 2024, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable and up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Board, liquidate and dissolve, subject to the approval of the remaining public shareholders and the Board, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in each case, to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law.\n\nWe believe that the provision of the Charter described in the preceding paragraph was included to protect the Company’s shareholders from having to sustain their investments for an unreasonably long period if the Company failed to find a suitable business combination in the timeframe contemplated by the Charter. We also believe, however, that given the Company’s expenditure of time, effort and money on pursuing a business combination and our belief that a business combination offers an attractive investment for our shareholders, the Extension is warranted.\n\nThe Company is not asking you to vote on any proposed business combination at this time. If the Extension is implemented and you do not elect to redeem your public shares, you will retain the right to vote on any proposed business combination when it is submitted to shareholders in the future and the right to redeem your public shares at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, in the event the proposed business combination is approved and completed or the Company has not consummated a business combination by the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable.\n\nThe Sponsor\n\nThe Company’s Sponsor is Whale Bay International Company Limited, a British Virgin Islands limited company. The Sponsor currently owns an aggregate of 343, 125 Class A ordinary Shares and 637,500 Class B Ordinary Shares. The Sponsor is controlled by Yadan Bai, its ultimate natural beneficial owner of the Sponsor, and has ultimate voting and dispositive power over the shares held by such entity and therefore may be deemed to be the ultimate beneficial owner of the securities held by such entity. Yadan Bai is also proposed to be a director of the Company assuming the successful contemplated business combination with Huajin.\n\nIf the Extension Is Not Approved\n\nIf the Extension Proposal is not approved and we do not consummate a business combination by September 28, 2024, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable and up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Board, liquidate and dissolve, subject to the approval of the remaining public shareholders and the Board, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in the each case, to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law.\n\nThe Insiders have agreed to waive their respective rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account in respect of any Class B Ordinary Shares held by it or them, as applicable, if the Company fails to complete a business combination by September 28, 2024, or by the applicable deadline as may be extended, although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Class A Ordinary Shares they hold if the \n\n23\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nCompany fails to complete its business combination by such date. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, and rights which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination by September28, 2024 or by the applicable deadline as may be extended.\n\nIf the Extension Is Approved\n\nIf the Extension is approved, the Company will file the amendment to the Charter with the Cayman Registrar in the form of Annex A hereto to extend the time it has to complete a business combination until the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable. The Company will remain a reporting company under the Exchange Act, and its units, Class A Ordinary Shares, public rights, and public warrants will remain publicly traded. The Company will then continue to work to consummate its business combination by the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable.\n\nIn addition, if the Extension Proposal is approved and the Extension is implemented, the Sponsor or its designees will deposit into the Trust Account as a Contribution, (i) on or before September 28, 2024, with respect to the extension to the Extended Date, an amount equal to $230,000, and (ii) one business day following the public announcement by the Company disclosing that the Board has determined to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination for an additional month, with respect to the extension to each such Additional Extended Date, an amount equal to $230,000, in each case in accordance with the Extension. The Contributions will be evidenced by the Contribution Note and will be repayable by the Company upon the Maturity Date. Such loans may be converted into warrants of the post-business combination entity, which shall have terms identical to the private placement warrants sold concurrently with the IPO, each exercisable for one Class A Ordinary Share at a purchase price of $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the Contributor. If the Company does not consummate a business combination by the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable, any such promissory notes will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. Any Contribution is conditioned on the approval of the Extension Proposal and the implementation of the Extension. No Contribution will occur if the Extension Proposal is not approved or the Extension is not implemented. If the Company has consummated a business combination or announced its intention to wind up prior to any Contribution Date, any obligation to make Contributions will terminate.\n\nYou are not being asked to vote on a business combination at this time. If the Extension is implemented and you do not elect to redeem your public shares, you will retain the right to vote on our business combination if and when it is submitted to shareholders and the right to redeem your public shares for cash in the event a business combination is approved and completed or the Company has not consummated a business combination by the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable.\n\nIf the Extension Proposal is approved, and the Extension is implemented, the amount held in the Trust Account will be reduced by withdrawals in connection with any shareholder redemptions. The Company cannot predict the amount that will remain in the Trust Account if the Extension is approved, and the amount remaining in the Trust Account may be significantly less than the $63,495,783.48 that was in the Trust Account as of the Record Date. The Company may need to obtain additional funds to complete its business combination, and there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on terms acceptable to the parties or at all.\n\nIf the Extension is approved, our Sponsor, will continue to be entitled to receive payments from the Company of $10,000 per month for office space and secretarial and administrative services provided to members of our management team until the earlier of the Company’s consummation of a business combination or the Company’s liquidation pursuant to the Administrative Support Agreement.\n\nRedemption Rights\n\nIn connection with the approval of the Extension, each public shareholder may seek to redeem his, her or its public shares. Holders of public shares who do not elect to redeem their public shares in connection with the Extension will retain the right to redeem their public shares in connection with any shareholder vote to approve a proposed business combination, or if the Company has not consummated a business combination by the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable.\n\n24\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nTO DEMAND REDEMPTION, YOU MUST ENSURE YOUR BANK OR BROKER COMPLIES WITH THE REQUIREMENTS IDENTIFIED HEREIN, INCLUDING SUBMITTING A WRITTEN REQUEST THAT YOUR SHARES BE REDEEMED FOR CASH TO THE TRANSFER AGENT AND TENDERING OR DELIVERING YOUR PUBLIC SHARES (AND SHARE CERTIFICATES (IF ANY) AND OTHER REDEMPTION FORMS) TO THE TRANSFER AGENT PRIOR TO 12:00 P.M. EASTERN TIME ON SEPTEMBER28, 2024. You will only be entitled to receive cash in connection with a redemption of these shares if you continue to hold them until the effective date of the Extension and redemptions.\n\nPursuant to the Charter, a public shareholder may request that the Company redeem all or a portion of such public shareholder’s public shares for cash if the Extension Proposal or the Founder Share Amendment Proposal is approved. You will be entitled to receive cash for any public shares to be redeemed only if you:\n\n(i)(a) hold public shares or (b) hold public shares as part of units and elect to separate such units into the underlying public shares, public rights, and public warrants prior to exercising your redemption rights with respect to the public shares; and\n\n(ii)prior to 12:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on September 23, 2024 (two business days prior to the vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting), (a) submit a written request to Continental, the Company’s transfer agent, that the Company redeem your public shares for cash and (b) tender or deliver your public shares (and share certificates (if any) and other redemption forms) to the transfer agent, physically or electronically through The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”).\n\nHolders of units must elect to separate the underlying public shares, public rights, and public warrants prior to exercising redemption rights with respect to the public shares. If holders hold their units in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, holders must notify their broker or bank that they elect to separate the units into the underlying public shares, public rights, and public warrants, or if a holder holds units registered in its, his or her own name, the holder must contact the transfer agent directly and instruct it to do so. Public shareholders may elect to redeem all or a portion of their public shares even if they vote for or against the Extension Proposal or the Founder Share Amendment Proposal, or do not vote at all, and regardless of whether they hold public shares on the Record Date.\n\nThrough the Deposit Withdrawal at Custodian (“DWAC”) system, this electronic delivery process can be accomplished by the shareholder, whether or not it is a record holder or its shares are held in “street name,” by contacting the transfer agent or its broker and requesting tendering/delivery of its shares through the DWAC system. Tendering or delivering shares physically may take significantly longer. In order to obtain a physical share certificate, a shareholder’s broker and/or clearing broker, DTC, and the Company’s transfer agent will need to act together to facilitate this request. There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or tendering/delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will typically charge a tendering broker fee and the broker would determine whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. It is the Company’s understanding that shareholders should generally allot at least two weeks to obtain physical certificates from the transfer agent. The Company does not have any control over this process or over the brokers or DTC, and it may take longer than two weeks to obtain a physical share certificate. Such shareholders will have less time to make their investment decision than those shareholders that tender or deliver their shares (and share certificates (if any) and other redemption forms) through the DWAC system. Shareholders who request physical share certificates and wish to redeem may be unable to meet the deadline for tendering their shares before exercising their redemption rights and thus will be unable to redeem their shares.\n\nCertificates that have not been tendered in accordance with these procedures prior to the vote on the Extension will not be redeemed for cash held in the Trust Account. Any demand for redemption, once made, may be withdrawn at any time until the deadline for exercising redemption requests and thereafter, with the Company’s consent, until a vote is taken with respect to the Extension, if any. If you tendered or delivered your public shares (and share certificates (if any) and other redemption forms) for redemption to our transfer agent and decide prior to the vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting not to redeem your shares, you may request that our transfer agent return the shares (physically or electronically). You may make such request by contacting our transfer agent at the address listed above. In the event that a public shareholder tenders shares and the Extension is not approved, these shares will not be redeemed and the physical certificates representing these shares will be returned to the shareholder promptly following the determination that the Extension will not be approved. The Company anticipates that a public shareholder who tenders shares for redemption in connection with the vote to approve the Extension would receive \n\n25\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\npayment of the redemption price for such shares soon after the completion of the Extension. The transfer agent will hold the certificates of public shareholders that make the election until such shares are redeemed for cash or returned to such shareholders.\n\nIf properly demanded, the Company will redeem each public share for a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes, divided by the number of then-issued and outstanding Class A Ordinary Shares. Based upon the amount held in the Trust Account as of the Record Date, which was $ (including interest not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes), the Company estimates that the per-share price at which public shares may be redeemed from cash held in the Trust Account will be approximately $10.27 at the time of the Extraordinary General Meeting. The closing price of a Class A Ordinary Share on the Record Date was $11.03. Accordingly, if the market price were to remain the same until the date of the Extraordinary General Meeting, exercising redemption rights would result in a public shareholder receiving approximately $0.001 less per share than if such shareholder sold its public shares in the open market. The Company cannot assure shareholders that they will be able to sell their Class A Ordinary Shares in the open market, even if the market price per share is higher than the redemption price stated above, as there may not be sufficient liquidity in its securities when such shareholders wish to sell their shares.\n\nIf you exercise your redemption rights, you will be exchanging your Ordinary Shares for cash and will no longer own such shares. You will be entitled to receive cash for these shares only if you properly demand redemption and tender your share certificate(s) (if any) and other redemption forms to the Company’s transfer agent prior to the vote on the Extension Proposal. The Company anticipates that a public shareholder who tenders shares for redemption in connection with the vote to approve the Extension Proposal would receive payment of the redemption price for such shares soon after the completion of the Extension.\n\nUnited States Federal Income Tax Considerations\n\nThe following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations for U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below, and together, “Holders”) of Public Shares (i) of the Extension Proposal, the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal and the Founder Share Amendment Proposal and (ii) that elect to have their public shares redeemed for cash if the Extension Proposal or the Founder Share Amendment Proposal is approved. This section applies only to Holders that hold their public shares as “capital assets” for U.S. federal income tax purposes (generally, property held for investment). For purposes of this discussion, because the components of a unit are generally separable at the option of the holder, the holder of a unit generally should be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as the owner of the underlying public share, public right and public warrant components of the unit, and the discussion below with respect to actual Holders of public shares also should apply to holders of units (as the deemed owners of the underlying public shares, public rights, and public warrants that constitute the units). Accordingly, the separation of units into the public shares, public rights and public warrants underlying the units generally should not be a taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This position is not free from doubt, and no assurance can be given that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a contrary position. Holders of units are urged to consult their tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of the proposals described in this proxy statement (including any redemption of the public shares in connection therewith) with respect to any public shares held through the units (including alternative characterizations of the units).\n\nThis discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to the Sponsor or its affiliates, officers or directors of the Company, or to any person of holding Founder Shares or warrants or rights issued in the private placement conducted in conjunction with our initial public offering. This discussion is limited to U.S. federal income tax considerations and does not address any estate or gift tax considerations or considerations arising under the tax laws of any U.S. state or local or non-U.S. jurisdiction. This discussion does not describe all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to you in light of your particular circumstances, including the alternative minimum tax, the Medicare tax on certain investment income and the different consequences that may apply if you are subject to special rules under U.S. federal income tax law that apply to certain types of investors, such as:\n\n•banks, financial institutions or financial services entities;\n\n•broker-dealers;\n\n26\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\n•taxpayers that are subject to the mark-to-market accounting rules with respect to the public shares;\n\n•tax-exempt entities;\n\n•governments or agencies or instrumentalities thereof;\n\n•insurance companies;\n\n•regulated investment companies or real estate investment trusts;\n\n•partnerships (including entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes) or pass-through entities (including S Corporations), or persons that hold the public shares through such a partnership or pass-through entity;\n\n•U.S. expatriates or former long-term residents of the United States;\n\n•persons that actually or constructively own five percent or more (by vote or value) of the Company’s shares (except as specifically provided below);\n\n•persons that acquired their public shares pursuant to an exercise of employee share options, in connection with employee share incentive plans or otherwise as compensation;\n\n•persons that hold their public shares as part of a straddle, constructive sale, hedge, wash sale, conversion or other integrated or similar transaction;\n\n•U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; or\n\n•“specified foreign corporations” (including “controlled foreign corporations”), “passive foreign investment companies” or corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax.\n\nIf a partnership (or any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds public shares, the tax treatment of such partnership and a person treated as a partner of such partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding any public shares and persons that are treated as partners of such partnerships should consult their tax advisors as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences to them of the proposals described in this proxy statement and the exercise of redemption rights with respect to their public shares.\n\nThis discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), proposed, temporary and final Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, all as of the date hereof. All of the foregoing is subject to change, which change could apply retroactively and could affect the tax considerations described herein.\n\nThe Company has not sought, and does not intend to seek, any rulings from the IRS as to any U.S. federal income tax considerations described herein. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take positions inconsistent with the considerations discussed below or that any such positions would not be sustained by a court.\n\nTHIS DISCUSSION IS ONLY A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPOSALS DESCRIBED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT AND THE EXERCISE OF REDEMPTION RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE PUBLIC SHARES. EACH HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO SUCH HOLDER OF THE PROPOSALS AND AN EXERCISE OF REDEMPTION RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECTS OF U.S. FEDERAL NON-INCOME, STATE AND LOCAL AND NON-U.S. TAX LAWS.\n\nTax Treatment of Non-Redeeming Shareholders\n\nA public shareholder who does not elect to redeem their public shares will continue to own its public shares and will not recognize any income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes solely as a result of the Extension Proposal, the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal or the Founder Share Amendment Proposal.\n\n27\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nTax Treatment of Redeeming Shareholders\n\nU.S. Holders\n\nAs used herein, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a public share who or that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\n•an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;\n\n•a corporation that is created or organized (or treated as created or organized) in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;\n\n•an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or\n\n•a trust if (1) a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it has a valid election in place to be treated as a United States person.\n\nTax Effects of Exercising Redemption Rights\n\nGenerally\n\nThe U.S. federal income tax consequences to a U.S. Holder of public shares that exercises its redemption rights with respect to its public shares to receive cash in exchange for all or a portion of its public shares will depend on whether the redemption qualifies as a sale of public shares under Section 302 of the Code. If the redemption qualifies as a sale of public shares by a U.S. Holder, the tax consequences to such U.S. Holder are as described below under the section entitled “— Taxation of Redemption Treated as a Sale of Public Shares.” If the redemption does not qualify as a sale of public shares, a U.S. Holder will be treated as receiving a corporate distribution with the tax consequences to such U.S. Holder as described below under the section entitled “— Taxation of Redemption Treated as a Distribution.”\n\nWhether a redemption of public shares qualifies for sale treatment will depend largely on the total amount of shares in the Company treated as held by the redeemed U.S. Holder before and after the redemption (including any shares constructively owned by the U.S. Holder as a result of owning rights or warrants) relative to all of the shares of the Company outstanding before and after the redemption. The redemption of public shares generally will be treated as a sale of public shares (rather than as a corporate distribution) if the redemption (1) is “substantially disproportionate” with respect to the U.S. Holder, (2) results in a “complete termination” of the U.S. Holder’s interest in the Company or (3) is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to the U.S. Holder. These tests are explained more fully below.\n\nIn determining whether any of the foregoing tests result in a redemption qualifying for sale treatment, a U.S. Holder takes into account not only shares of the Company actually owned by the U.S. Holder, but also shares of the Company that are constructively owned by it under certain attribution rules set forth in the Code. A U.S. Holder may constructively own, in addition to shares owned directly, shares owned by certain related individuals and entities in which the U.S. Holder has an interest or that have an interest in such U.S. Holder, as well as any shares that the U.S. Holder has a right to acquire by exercise of an option, which would generally include public shares which could be acquired pursuant to the exercise of public rights or warrants.\n\nIn order to meet the substantially disproportionate test, the percentage of the Company’s outstanding voting shares actually and constructively owned by the U.S. Holder immediately following the redemption of public shares must, among other requirements, be less than eighty percent (80%) of the percentage of the Company’s outstanding voting shares actually and constructively owned by the U.S. Holder immediately before the redemption (taking into account redemptions by other holders of public shares). Prior to the Company’s business combination the public shares may not be treated as voting shares for this purpose, and consequently, this substantially disproportionate test may not be applicable. There will be a complete termination of a U.S. Holder’s interest if either (1) all of the shares in the Company actually and constructively owned by the U.S. Holder are redeemed or (2) all of the shares in the Company actually owned by the U.S. Holder are redeemed and the U.S. Holder is eligible to waive, and effectively waives in accordance with specific rules, the attribution of shares owned by certain family members and the U.S. Holder does not constructively own any other shares of the Company (including any shares constructively owned by \n\n28\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nthe U.S. Holder as a result of owning rights or warrants). The redemption of public shares will not be essentially equivalent to a dividend if the redemption results in a “meaningful reduction” of the U.S. Holder’s proportionate interest in the Company. Whether the redemption will result in a meaningful reduction in a U.S. Holder’s proportionate interest in the Company will depend on the particular facts and circumstances. However, the IRS has indicated in a published ruling that even a small reduction in the proportionate interest of a small minority shareholder in a publicly held corporation where such shareholder exercises no control over corporate affairs may constitute such a “meaningful reduction.”\n\nIf none of the foregoing tests is satisfied, then the redemption of public shares will be treated as a corporate distribution to the redeemed U.S. Holder and the tax effects to such a U.S. Holder will be as described below under the section entitled “— Taxation of Redemption Treated as a Distribution.” After the application of those rules, any remaining tax basis of the U.S. Holder in the redeemed public shares will be added to the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its remaining shares of the Company, or, if it has none, to the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its public rights or warrants or possibly in other shares of the Company constructively owned by the U.S. Holder.\n\nU.S. Holders who actually or constructively own at least five percent (5%) by vote or value (or, if the public shares are not then considered to be publicly traded, at least one percent (1%) by vote or value) or more of the total outstanding shares in the Company may be subject to special reporting requirements with respect to a redemption of public shares, and such holders should consult with their tax advisors with respect to their reporting requirements.\n\nTaxation of Redemption Treated as a Distribution\n\nIf the redemption of a U.S. Holder’s public shares is treated as a corporate distribution, as discussed above under the section entitled “— Generally,” subject to the passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) rules discussed below, the amount of cash received in the redemption generally will constitute a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from the Company’s current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of the Company’s current and accumulated earnings and profits will constitute a return of capital that will be applied against and reduce (but not below zero) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its public shares. Any remaining excess will be treated as gain realized on the sale of public shares and will be treated as described below under the section entitled “— Taxation of Redemption Treated as a Sale of Public Shares.”\n\nTaxation of Redemption Treated as a Sale of Public Shares\n\nIf the redemption of a U.S. Holder’s public shares is treated as a sale, as discussed above under the section entitled “— Generally,” subject to the PFIC rules discussed below, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash received in the redemption and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the public shares redeemed. Any such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the public shares so disposed of exceeds one year. Long-term capital gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders generally will be eligible to be taxed at reduced rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\n\nU.S. Holders who hold different blocks of public shares (including as a result of holding different blocks of public shares purchased or acquired on different dates or at different prices) should consult their tax advisors to determine how the above rules apply to them.\n\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Rules\n\nDefinition of a PFIC\n\nA foreign (i.e., non-U.S.) corporation will be classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes if either (i) at least 75% of its gross income in a taxable year, including its pro rata share of the gross income of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by value, is passive income or (ii) at least 50% of its assets in a taxable year (generally determined based on fair market value and averaged quarterly over the year), including its pro rata share of the assets of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by value, are held for the production of, or produce, passive income. Passive income generally includes, among other things, dividends, interest, rents and royalties (other than rents or royalties derived from the active conduct of a trade or business received from unrelated persons) and gains from the disposition of passive assets. The determination of \n\n29\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nwhether a foreign corporation is a PFIC is made annually. Pursuant to a “startup exception,” a foreign corporation will not be a PFIC for the first taxable year the foreign corporation has gross income (the “startup year”) if (1) no predecessor of the foreign corporation was a PFIC; (2) the foreign corporation satisfies the IRS that it will not be a PFIC for either of the first two taxable years following the startup year; and (3) the foreign corporation is not in fact a PFIC for either of those years.\n\nPFIC Status of the Company\n\nBased upon the composition of its income and assets, and upon a review of its financial statements, the Company believes that it likely will not be eligible for the startup exception and therefore likely was a PFIC since its first taxable year and likely will be considered a PFIC for its current taxable year. However, the Company’s actual PFIC status for any taxable year will not be determinable until after the end of such taxable year. Accordingly, there can be no assurance with respect to the Company’s status as a PFIC for its current taxable year or any future taxable year. In addition, the Company’s U.S. counsel expresses no opinion with respect to the Company’s PFIC status for any taxable year.\n\nEffects of PFIC Rules on Redemption\n\nAlthough the Company’s PFIC status is determined annually, an initial determination that the Company is a PFIC generally will apply for subsequent years to a U.S. Holder who held public shares while the Company was a PFIC, whether or not the Company meets the test for PFIC status in those subsequent years. If the Company has been classified as a PFIC at any time during a U.S. Holder’s holding period in its public shares, and the U.S. Holder has not timely made (a) a QEF Election (as defined below) for the first taxable year in which the U.S. Holder owned such public shares or in which the Company was a PFIC, whichever is later (or a QEF Election along with a purging election) or an (b) an MTM Election (as defined below) with respect to such public shares, any gain recognized by the U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of such public shares (which may include gain realized by reason of transfers of public shares that would otherwise qualify as non-recognition transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and any “excess distribution” made to the U.S. Holder (generally, any distributions to such U.S. Holder during a taxable year of the U.S. Holder that are greater than 125% of the average annual distributions received by such U.S. Holder in respect of the public shares during the three preceding taxable years of such U.S. Holder or, if shorter, the portion of such U.S. Holder’s holding period for the public shares that preceded the taxable year of the distribution) would be taxed based on a complex set of computational rules designed to offset the tax deferral with respect to the undistributed earnings of the Company. Under these rules (the “excess distribution regime”):\n\n•the U.S. Holder’s gain or excess distribution will be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder’s holding period for such U.S. Holder’s public shares;\n\n•the amount allocated to the U.S. Holder’s taxable year in which the U.S. Holder recognized the gain or received the excess distribution, or to the period in the U.S. Holder’s holding period before the first day of the Company’s first taxable year in which the Company was a PFIC, will be taxed as ordinary income;\n\n•the amount allocated to other taxable years (or portions thereof) of the U.S. Holder and included in such U.S. Holder’s holding period would be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for that year and applicable to the U.S. Holder without regard to the U.S. Holder’s other items of income and loss for such year; and\n\n•an additional amount equal to the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed on the U.S. Holder in respect of the tax attributable to each such other taxable year (described in the third bullet above) of such U.S. Holder.\n\nQEF Election and Mark-to-Mark Election\n\nAs noted above, the impact of the PFIC rules on a U.S. Holder of public shares will depend on whether the U.S. Holder has made a timely and effective election to treat the Company as a “qualified electing fund” under Section 1295 of the Code for the taxable year that is the first year in the U.S. Holder’s holding period of public shares during which the Company qualified as a PFIC (a “QEF Election”) or, if in a later taxable year, the U.S. Holder made a QEF Election along with a purging election. One type of purging election creates a deemed sale of the U.S. Holder’s public shares at their then fair market value and requires the U.S. Holder to recognize gain \n\n30\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\npursuant to such purging election subject to the excess distribution regime described above. As a result of any such purging election, the U.S. Holder would increase the adjusted tax basis in its public shares by the amount of the gain recognized and, solely for purposes of the PFIC rules, would have a new holding period in its public shares.\n\nU.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the application of the rules governing purging elections to their particular circumstances.\n\nA U.S. Holder’s ability to make a timely and effective QEF Election (or a QEF Election along with a purging election) with respect to its public shares is contingent upon, among other things, the provision by the Company of a “PFIC Annual Information Statement” to such U.S. Holder. If the Company determines it is a PFIC for any taxable year, upon written request, the Company will endeavor to provide to a U.S. Holder such information as the IRS may require, including a PFIC Annual Information Statement, in order to enable the U.S. Holder to make and maintain a QEF Election, but there is no assurance that the Company will timely provide such required information. There is also no assurance that the Company will have timely knowledge of its status as a PFIC in the future or of the required information to be provided.\n\nA U.S. Holder that has made a timely and effective QEF Election (or a QEF Election along with a purging election) with respect to its public shares generally would not be subject to the excess distribution regime discussed above in connection with the redemption of public shares, and instead any gain recognized on the redemption of public shares treated as a sale of the public shares generally will be taxable as capital gain and no additional interest charge will be imposed under the PFIC rules. As discussed above, if the Company is a PFIC for any taxable year, a U.S. Holder of public shares that has made a timely and effective QEF Election would include annually in gross income its pro rata share of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the Company, whether or not such amounts are actually distributed for such year. A subsequent distribution of such earnings and profits (including the relevant portion (if any) of the amount received in connection with the redemption of public shares treated as a corporate distribution) that were previously included in income generally should not be taxable when distributed to such U.S. Holder. The tax basis of a U.S. Holder’s public shares in a QEF will be increased by amounts that are included in income and decreased by amounts distributed but not taxed as dividends (including the relevant portion (if any) of the amount received in connection with the redemption of public shares treated as a corporate distribution), under the above rules. In addition, if the Company is not a PFIC for any taxable year, such U.S. Holder will not be subject to the QEF inclusion regime with respect to its public shares for such a taxable year.\n\nThe impact of the PFIC rules on a U.S. Holder of public shares may also depend on whether the U.S. Holder has made a mark-to-market election under Section 1296 of the Code (an “MTM Election”). U.S. Holders who hold (actually or constructively) stock or shares of a foreign corporation that is classified as a PFIC may elect to mark such stock or shares to its market value each taxable year if such stock or shares is “marketable stock,” generally, stock or shares that are regularly traded on a national securities exchange that is registered with the SEC, including Nasdaq. No assurance can be given that the public shares are considered to be marketable stock for purposes of the MTM Election for any taxable year or whether the other requirements of this election are satisfied. If an MTM Election is available and a U.S. Holder has made such election, such U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to the excess distribution regime discussed above with respect to their public shares in connection with the redemption of their public shares. Instead, any gain recognized on the redemption of public shares treated as a sale of the public shares generally will be taxable as ordinary income to such electing U.S. Holder (and no additional interest charge will be applied to the U.S. Holder). Any loss recognized on the redemption of public shares treated as a sale of public shares generally will be treated as ordinary loss to the extent to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of the MTM Election, and any further loss recognized generally will be treated as a capital loss (the deductibility of which is subject to limitations). For purposes of determining the adjusted tax basis of public shares, certain adjustments are made to take into account the manner in which an electing U.S. Holder is taxed as a result of the MTM Election. In general, an electing U.S. Holder will include as ordinary income each year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of its public shares at the end of its taxable year over its adjusted tax basis in its public shares. The electing U.S. Holder also will recognize an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of its adjusted tax basis in its public shares over the fair market value of its public shares at the end of its taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of the MTM Election). The electing U.S. Holder’s tax basis in its public shares will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts. However, if the MTM Election is not made by a U.S. Holder with respect to the first taxable year of its holding period for the \n\n31\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\npublic shares in which the Company is a PFIC, then the excess distribution regime discussed above under the section entitled “— Effects of PFIC Rules on Redemption” will apply to certain dispositions of, distributions on and other amounts taxable with respect to, Public Shares, including in connection with the redemption of public shares.\n\nA U.S. Holder that owns (or is deemed to own) shares in a PFIC during any taxable year of the U.S. Holder, may have to file an IRS Form 8621 (whether or not a QEF Election or MTM Election is made) and such other information as may be required by the U.S. Treasury Department. Failure to do so, if required, will extend the statute of limitations until such required information is furnished to the IRS.\n\nThe rules dealing with PFICs and with the QEF, purging, and MTM elections are very complex and are affected by various factors in addition to those described above. Accordingly, U.S. Holders of the public shares should consult their own tax advisors concerning the application of the PFIC rules to the public shares under their particular circumstances.\n\nALL U.S. HOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF A REDEMPTION OF ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR PUBLIC SHARES PURSUANT TO AN EXERCISE OF REDEMPTION RIGHTS.\n\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\n\nPayments of cash to a U.S. Holder as a result of the redemption of the public shares may be subject to information reporting to the IRS and possible U.S. backup withholding. Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a U.S. Holder who furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and makes other required certifications, or who is otherwise exempt from backup withholding and establishes such exempt status.\n\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, and the U.S. Holder generally may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely filing the appropriate claim for refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information.\n\nNon-U.S. Holders\n\nAs used herein, a “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a public share who or that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\n•a non-resident alien individual, other than certain former citizens and residents of the United States subject to U.S. tax as expatriates;\n\n•a foreign corporation; or\n\n•an estate or trust that is not a U.S. Holder.\n\nGenerally\n\nThe U.S. federal income tax consequences to a Non-U.S. Holder of public shares that exercises its redemption rights to receive cash from the Trust Account in exchange for all or a portion of its public shares will depend on whether the redemption qualifies as a sale of the public shares redeemed, as described above under “Tax Treatment of Redeeming Shareholders — U.S. Holders — Tax Effects of Exercising Redemption Rights — Generally.” Regardless of whether it is treated as a sale of public shares or as a corporate distribution on the public shares for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the redemption is not expected to result in any U.S. federal income tax consequences to the Non-U.S. Holder unless such Non-U.S. Holder holds such public shares in connection with a conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base that such Non-U.S. Holder maintains in the United States).\n\n32\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\n\nPayments of cash to a Non-U.S. Holder as a result of the redemption of public shares may be subject to information reporting to the IRS and possible U.S. backup withholding. A Non-U.S. Holder may have to comply with certification procedures to establish that it is not a U.S. person in order to avoid information reporting and backup withholding requirements. The certification procedures required to claim a reduced rate of withholding under a treaty generally will satisfy the certification requirements necessary to avoid the backup withholding as well.\n\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a Non-U.S. Holder generally will be allowed as a credit against such Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle such Non-U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\n\nAs previously noted above, the foregoing discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations is included for general information purposes only and is not intended to be, and should not be construed as, legal or tax advice to any shareholder. The Company once again urges you to consult with your own tax adviser to determine the particular tax consequences to you (including the application and effect of any U.S. federal, state, local or foreign income or other tax laws) of the proposals described in this proxy statement and the exercise of redemption rights in connection therewith.\n\nResolution to be Voted Upon\n\nThe full text of the resolution to be proposed is as follows:\n\n“RESOLVED, as a special resolution, to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the “Charter”) pursuant to an amendment to the Charter in the form set forth in Annex A of the accompanying proxy statement to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination (a “business combination”) from September 28, 2024 (the “Current Outside Date”) to December 28, 2024 (the “Extended Date”) and to allow the Company, without another shareholder vote, by resolution of the Company’s board of directors, to elect to further extend the Extended Date in three-month increments up to 1 additional time, or a total of up to six months after the Current Outside Date, until up to March 28, 2025 (each, an “Additional Extended Date”), (the “Extension,” and such proposal, the “Extension Proposal”).”\n\nVote Required for Approval\n\nApproval of the Extension Proposal requires a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the Ordinary Shares which are represented in person or by proxy, or by corporate representative, or by corporate representative, and are voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes, while considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum, will not count as votes cast at the Extraordinary General Meeting. If the Extension is not approved and we do not consummate a business combination by September 28, 2024, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (less taxes payable and up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Board, liquidate and dissolve, subject to the approval of the remaining public shareholders and the Board, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in each case, to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law.\n\nThe Insiders are are expected to vote all Ordinary Shares owned by them in favor of the Extension. On the Record Date, the Insiders beneficially owned and were entitled to vote an aggregate of 1,780,625 Ordinary Shares, which represents approximately 23% of the Company’s issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares.\n\n33\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nIn addition, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), the Sponsor, the Company’s initial and current directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates may (i) purchase public shares from institutional and other investors (including those who vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against any of the proposals presented at the Extraordinary General Meeting, or elect to redeem, or indicate an intention to redeem, public shares), (ii) enter into transactions with such investors and others to provide them with incentives to not redeem their public shares, or (iii) execute agreements to purchase such public shares from such investors or enter into non-redemption agreements in the future. In the event that the Sponsor, the Company’s directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates purchase public shares in situations in which the tender offer rules restrictions on purchases would apply, they (a) would purchase the public shares at a price no higher than the price offered through the Company’s redemption process (i.e., approximately $11.04 per share, based on the amounts held in the Trust Account as of the Record Date (including interest not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes)); (b) would represent in writing that such public shares will not be voted in favor of approving the Extension; and (c) would waive in writing any redemption rights with respect to the public shares so purchased.\n\nTo the extent any such purchases by the Sponsor, the Company’s directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates are made in situations in which the tender offer rules restrictions on purchases apply, the Company will disclose in a Current Report on Form 8-K prior to the Extraordinary General Meeting the following: (i) the number of public shares purchased outside of the redemption offer, along with the purchase price(s) for such public shares; (ii) the purpose of any such purchases; (iii) the impact, if any, of the purchases on the likelihood that the Extension will be approved; (iv) the identities of the securityholders who sold to the Sponsor, the Company’s directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates (if not purchased on the open market) or the nature of the securityholders (e.g., 5% security holders) who sold such public shares; and (v) the number of Ordinary Shares for which the Company has received redemption requests pursuant to its redemption offer.\n\nThe purpose of such share purchases and other transactions would be to increase the likelihood of otherwise limiting the number of public shares electing to redeem.\n\nIf such transactions are effected, the consequence could be to cause the Extension to be effectuated in circumstances where such effectuation could not otherwise occur. Consistent with SEC guidance, purchases of shares by the persons described above would not be permitted to be voted for the Extension at the Extraordinary General Meeting and could decrease the chances that the Extension would be approved. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our securities and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.\n\nInterests of the Sponsor and the Company’s Directors and Officers\n\nWhen you consider the recommendation of our Board, you should keep in mind that the Sponsor and the Company’s officers and directors have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a shareholder. These interests include, among other things:\n\n•If the Extension is not approved and we do not consummate a business combination by September28, 2024, the 718,750 Class B Ordinary Shares held by the Sponsor (whose members include certain of our initial and current directors and officers) will be worthless (as the Sponsor has waived liquidation rights with respect to such shares), as will the 343,125 private placement Warrants and 343,125 private palcement Rights held by the Sponsor. The Founder Shares had an aggregate market value of approximately $7,927,812.5 based on the last sale price of $11.03 on Nasdaq on September4, 2024 (the Record Date), the private placement Warrants had an aggregate market value of approximately $10,293.75 based on the last sale price of $0.03 on Nasdaq on September4, 2024 (the Record Date), and the private placement Rights had an aggregate market value of approximately $65,193.75 based on the last sale price of $0.19 on Nasdaq on September4, 2024 (the Record Date)\n\n•If we do not successfully consummate a business combination, the Sponsor will lose its investment in the Company, which totals $3,456,250 in value as of September4, 2024, the Record Date, and the potential loss of this investment could incentivize the Sponsor and its affiliates to pursue a business combination transaction on unfavorable terms in order to avoid a liquidation and a loss of its investment.\n\n34\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\n•All rights specified in the Charter relating to the right of officers and directors to be indemnified by the Company, and of the Company’s officers and directors to be exculpated from monetary liability with respect to prior acts or omissions, will continue after a business combination and, if the Extension is not approved and no business combination is completed by September28, 2024, so that the Company liquidates, the Company will not be able to perform its obligations to its officers and directors under those provisions;\n\n•In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party (excluding the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.175 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.175 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable), nor will it apply to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.\n\n•None of the Company’s officers or directors has received any cash compensation for services rendered to the Company, and all of the current officers and directors are expected to continue to serve in their roles at least through the date of the Extraordinary General Meeting and may continue to serve following any potential business combination and receive compensation thereafter; and\n\n•The Sponsor and the Company’s officers and directors and their respective affiliates are entitled to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them related to identifying, investigating, negotiating and completing a business combination and, if the Extension is not approved and we do not consummate a business combination by September28, 2024, they will not have any claim against the Trust Account for reimbursement so that the Company will most likely be unable to reimburse such expenses. As of the date of this proxy statement, the out-of-pocket expenses and outstanding loans are approximately $1,492,700.\n\nRecommendation of the Board\n\nAs discussed above, after careful consideration of all relevant factors, the Board has determined that the Extension Proposal is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Board has approved and declared advisable the adoption of the Extension Proposal.\n\nThe Sponsor and all of the Company’s directors, executive officers and their affiliates are expected to vote any Ordinary Shares owned by them in favor of the Extension Proposal.\n\nOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” THE EXTENSIONPROPOSAL. OUR BOARD EXPRESSES NO OPINION AS TO WHETHER YOU SHOULD REDEEMYOUR PUBLIC SHARES.\n\n35\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nPROPOSAL NO. 2 — THE REDEMPTION LIMITATION AMENDMENT PROPOSAL\n\nOverview\n\nThe Company is proposing to amend its Charter to eliminate (i) the limitation that the Company may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause the Company’s net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and (ii) the limitation that the Company may not consummate a business combination unless the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately prior to, or upon consummation of, or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement that may be contained in the agreement relating to, such business combination.\n\nReasons for the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal\n\nThe purpose of the Redemption Limitation was to ensure that the Company would not be subject to the “penny stock” rules of the SEC as long as it met the Redemption Limitation, and therefore not be deemed a “blank check company” as defined under Rule 419 of the Securities Act because it complied with the NTA Rule. The Company is proposing to amend its Charter to remove the Redemption Limitation. The NTA Rule is one of several exclusions from the “penny stock” rules of the SEC and the Company believes that it can rely on another exclusion, namely the Exchange Rule. Therefore, the Company intends to rely on the exclusion from the penny stock rules set forth the Exchange Rule as a result of its securities being listed on Nasdaq.\n\nAs disclosed in our IPO prospectus, the Company is a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Under Rule 419 of the Securities Act the term “blank check company” means a company that (i) is a development stage company that has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies, or other entity or person; and (ii) is issuing “penny stock,” as defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the Exchange Act. Rule 3a51-1 sets forth that the term “penny stock” shall mean any equity security, unless it fits within certain enumerated exclusions including the NTA Rule and the Exchange Rule. Historically SPACs have relied upon the NTA Rule to avoid being deemed a penny stock issuer. The inclusion of the Redemption Limitation in the Charter was to ensure that through the consummation of a business combination, the Company would not be considered a penny stock issuer and therefore a blank check company if no other exemption from the rule was available.\n\nThe Exchange Rule excludes from the definition of “penny stock” a security that is registered, or approved for registration upon notice of issuance, on a national securities exchange, or is listed, or approved for listing upon notice of issuance on, an automated quotation system sponsored by a registered national securities association, that has established initial listing standards that meet or exceed the criteria in the rule. The Company’s securities are listed on Nasdaq and have been since the consummation of its IPO. The Company believes that Nasdaq has initial listing standards that meet the criteria identified in the Exchange Rule and that it can therefore rely on this rule to avoid being treated as a penny stock. Therefore, the inclusion of the Redemption Limitation in the Charter is unnecessary.\n\nIf the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal is Not Approved\n\nIf the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal is not approved, the Redemption Limitation would apply to redemptions made in connection with the Extension and the Company’s business combination. Unless the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal is approved, we will not proceed with the Extension if redemptions of the public shares would cause the Company to exceed the Redemption Limitation. Further, if the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal is not approved and there are significant requests for redemption such that the Company’s net tangible assets would be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of a business combination, the Charter would prevent the Company from being able to consummate a business combination even if all other conditions to closing are met.\n\nIn the event that the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal is not approved and we receive notice of redemptions of public shares approaching or in excess of the Redemption Limitation, we and/or the Sponsor may take action to increase our net tangible assets to avoid exceeding the Redemption Limitation.\n\n36\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nIf the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal is Approved\n\nThe Redemption Limitation Amendment is conditioned on the approval of the Extension Proposal. If both the Extension Proposal and the Redemption Limitation Amendment are approved, the Company will file the amendment to the Charter with the Cayman Registrar in the form of Annex B hereto to eliminate the Redemption Limitation. The Company will also file the amendment to the Charter in the form of Annex A hereto to effectuate the Extension. The Company will remain a reporting company under the Exchange Act, and its units, Class A Ordinary Shares, public rights, and public warrants will remain publicly traded. The Company will then continue to work to consummate its business combination by the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable.\n\nResolution to be Voted Upon\n\nThe full text of the resolution to be proposed is as follows:\n\n“RESOLVED, as a special resolution, to amend the Charter pursuant to an amendment to the Charter in the form set forth in Annex B of the accompanying proxy statement to eliminate from the Charter (i) the limitation that the Company may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause the Company’s net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and (ii) the limitation that the Company shall not consummate a business combination unless the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately prior to, or upon consummation of, or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement that may be contained in the agreement relating to, such business combination (collectively, the “Redemption Limitation”) (the “Redemption Limitation Amendment,” and such proposal the “Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal”);\n\nVote Required for Approval\n\nApproval of the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal requires a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the Ordinary Shares which are represented in person or by proxy, or by corporate representative, or by corporate representative, and are voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes, while considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum, will not count as votes cast at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\n\nThe Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal is cross-conditioned on the approval of the Extension Proposal. Accordingly, even if the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal is approved, the Redemption Limitation Amendment will not be implemented if the Extension Proposal is not approved.\n\nThe Sponsor and all of the Company’s directors, executive officers and their affiliates are expected to vote any Ordinary Shares owned by them in favor of the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal.\n\nRecommendation of the Board\n\nAfter careful consideration of all relevant factors, our Board has determined that the Redemption Limitation Amendment is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Our Board has approved and declared advisable the adoption of the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal.\n\nOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” THE REDEMPTION LIMITATION AMENDMENT PROPOSAL.\n\n37\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\nPROPOSAL NO. 3 — THE FOUNDER SHARE AMENDMENT PROPOSAL\n\nOverview\n\nThe Company is proposing to amend its Charter to allow the Company to provide for the right of a holder of the Company’s Class B Ordinary Shares to convert into Class A Ordinary Shares on a one-for-one basis at any time and from time to time prior to the closing of a business combination at the election of the holder.\n\nUpon conversion of the Class B Ordinary Shares to Class A Ordinary Shares, such Class A Ordinary Shares converted from Class B Ordinary Shares shall not be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account through redemptions or otherwise pursuant to the terms of the Letter Agreement entered into by and among the Company and each of its officers and directors in connection with the IPO (the “Letter Agreement”). Additionally, the Class A Ordinary Shares converted from Class B Ordinary Shares will be subject to all of the restrictions applicable to Class B Ordinary Shares under the terms of the Letter Agreement, including the prohibition on transferring, assigning or selling Class B Ordinary Shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) one year after the completion of a business combination or (B) the date on which the Company completes a business combination with one or more businesses that results in the Company’s shareholders having the right to exchange their Ordinary Shares for cash, securities or other property.\n\nA copy of the proposed amendment to the Charter of the Company is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C.\n\nReasons for the Founder Share Amendment Proposal\n\nThe Company’s Charter provides that the Class B Ordinary Shares automatically convert into Class A Ordinary Shares on a one-for-one basis, concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of a business combination. The purpose of the Founder Share Amendment Proposal is to provide the holders of the Class B Ordinary Shares with the flexibility to assist the Company in retaining investors and meeting the listing requirements of its Class A Ordinary Shares if necessary or desirable in connection with the Extension and the consummation of the Company’s business combination.\n\nIf the Founder Share Amendment Proposal Is Not Approved\n\nIf the Founder Share Amendment Proposal is not approved, the holders of Class B Ordinary Shares will not be able to convert Class B Ordinary Shares to Class A Ordinary Shares prior to the completion of a business combination. If the Founder Share Amendment Proposal is not approved, we believe it may reduce our flexibility to maintain a listing of our Class A Ordinary Shares.\n\nIf the Founder Share Amendment Proposal Is Approved\n\nThe Founder Share Amendment is conditioned on the approval of the Extension Proposal. If both the Extension and the Founder Share Amendment Proposal are approved, the Company will file the amendment to the Charter with the Cayman Registrar in the form of Annex C hereto to allow the holders of Class B Ordinary Shares to convert the Class B Ordinary Shares to Class A Ordinary Shares on a one-for-one basis at any point prior to the closing of a business combination at the election of the holder. The Company will also file the amendment to the Charter in the form of Annex A hereto to effectuate the Extension. The Company will remain a reporting company under the Exchange Act, and its units, Class A Ordinary Shares, public rights, and public warrants will remain publicly traded. The Company will then continue to work to consummate its business combination by the Extended Date or Additional Extended Date, as applicable.\n\nResolution to be Voted Upon\n\nThe full text of the resolution to be proposed is as follows:\n\n“RESOLVED, as a special resolution, to amend the Charter pursuant to an amendment to the Charter in the form set forth in Annex C of the accompanying proxy statement to amend the Charter to provide for the right of a holder of the Company’s Class B Ordinary Shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class B Ordinary Shares” and, together with the Class A Ordinary Shares, the “Ordinary Shares”), to convert into Class A Ordinary Shares, par value \n\n38\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC001)\n\n$0.0001 per share, of the Company (the “Class A Ordinary Shares” or “public shares”) at any time and from time to time on a one-for-one basis prior to the closing of a business combination at the election of the holder (the “Founder Share Amendment,” and such proposal, the “Founder Share Amendment Proposal”).”\n\nVote Required for Approval\n\nApproval of the Founder Share Amendment Proposal requires a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the Ordinary Shares which are represented in person or by proxy, or by corporate representative, or by corporate representative, and are voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting.
