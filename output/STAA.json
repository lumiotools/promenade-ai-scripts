(Instead of: APAC sales growth of 4% (prior outlook was 7%), including approximately 2% growth in China (prior outlook was 10%). \n\nThe updated release reads: \n\n**STAAR SURGICAL REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2024 RESULTS**\n\n_Net Sales Up 10% to $88.6 Million Driven by Growth in All Regions_\n\n_Americas Up 14%, EMEA Up 12% and APAC Up 9%_\n\n_Market Building Initiatives Drive EVO ICL™ Uptake and Reinforce Opportunity_\n\nSTAAR Surgical Company (NASDAQ: STAA), a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of the EVO family of Implantable Collamer® Lenses (EVO ICL™) for myopia, astigmatism and presbyopia, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 27, 2024. \n\n** Third Quarter 2024 Overview **\n\n  * Net sales of $88.6 million, up 10% from prior year quarter \n  * ICL sales of $89.1 million, up 10% from prior year quarter \n  * Gross margin of 77.3% as compared to 79.2% year ago \n  * Net income of $10.0 million or $0.20 per share, up from $4.8 million or $0.10 per share year ago \n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $16.2 million or $0.33 per share as compared to $16.5 million or $0.33 per share year ago \n  * $236.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments available for sale as of September 27, 2024 \n\n\n\n“In the third quarter, we achieved double-digit sales growth against a macroeconomic environment that softened in the second half of the quarter, particularly in China,” said Tom Frinzi, President and CEO of STAAR Surgical. “STAAR is well positioned to navigate through the current market dynamics, which we believe are transitory. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the recent shift in fiscal policy and announced stimulus in China and will continue to closely monitor the potential impact on our near to midterm growth outlook.” \n\nMr. Frinzi concluded, “Our focus on customer engagement and market expansion continues to yield solid results, helping drive industry-leading growth and market share gains. As our surgeon customers perform more EVO procedures, they are increasingly using our technology for moderate myopia, which underscores EVO ICL as the treatment choice for -6D and above and expands our total addressable market.” \n\n** Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results **\n\nNet sales were $88.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, up 10% from $80.3 million reported in the prior year quarter. This sales increase was driven by ICL sales growth of $8.0 million, up 10%, and unit growth of 6% from the prior year period. Other Product sales declined $0.2 million from the prior year period. Changes in currency, primarily the Japanese Yen, negatively impacted reported total net sales by $0.3 million for the third quarter of 2024. \n\nGross profit margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 77.3% of net sales as compared to the prior year quarter of 79.2% of net sales. Gross margin in the third quarter was lower primarily due to reduced unit production that resulted in less absorption of fixed overhead. \n\nOperating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $62.8 million, up from the prior year quarter of $57.3 million. General and administrative expenses were $21.7 million, up from $19.3 million in the prior year quarter, driven primarily by increased facility costs and compensation-related expenses. Selling and marketing expenses were $26.6 million – consistent with the prior year quarter. Research and development expenses were $14.5 million, up from the prior year quarter of $11.5 million, primarily due to purchases of in-process research and development, as well as compensation-related expenses, which were partially offset by lower clinical trial costs. \n\nOperating income for the third quarter of 2024 was $5.7 million or 6.4% of net sales as compared to operating income of $6.3 million or 7.8% of net sales for the third quarter of 2023. \n\nNet income for the third quarter of 2024 was $10.0 million or $0.20 income per share, up from $4.8 million or $0.10 income per share for the prior year quarter. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to a gain on foreign currency transactions. \n\nAs of September 27, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and investments available for sale totaled $236.0 million, up from $232.4 million on December 29, 2023. \n\n** Outlook **\n\nThe Company maintained its prior outlook for fiscal year 2024 net sales and Adjusted EBITDA. \n\n  * Net sales of $340 million to $345 million. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $42 million and Adjusted EBITDA per diluted share of approximately $0.80. \n\n\n\nThe outlook above contemplates EVO ICL sales growth of 17% in the Americas (prior outlook was 15%) including 20% in the U.S. (prior outlook was 25%); EMEA sales growth of 10% (prior outlook was 6%); and APAC sales growth of 5% (prior outlook was 7%), including approximately 2% growth in China (prior outlook was 10%) and all other APAC countries approximately 10-20% growth (prior outlook was flat). \n\n** Earnings Webcast **\n\nThe Company will host an earnings webcast today, Wednesday, October 30 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern / 1:30 p.m. Pacific to discuss its financial results and operational progress. To access the webcast please use the following link: [https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=fmU0YbKB](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fevent.choruscall.com%2Fmediaframe%2Fwebcast.html%3Fwebcastid%3DfmU0YbKB&esheet=54144790&newsitemid=20241030604379&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fevent.choruscall.com%2Fmediaframe%2Fwebcast.html%3Fwebcastid%3DfmU0YbKB&index=1&md5=f5e50e732f26ba42a44871b62ca66e01). \n\nThe live webcast, earnings webcast presentation and an archived version of the webcast can be accessed from the investor relations section of the STAAR website at [www.staar.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.staar.com&esheet=54144790&newsitemid=20241030604379&lan=en-US&anchor=www.staar.com&index=2&md5=4b200ce94696ddf3ff9230150259f9ac). \n\n** Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures **\n\nTo supplement the Company’s financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this press release and the accompanying tables include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its evaluation of Company operating performance and believes investors will find them useful in evaluating the Company’s operating performance, including cash flow generation, and in analyzing period-to-period financial performance of core business operations and underlying business trends. Non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. \n\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is calculated by adding interest income and expense, net; provision for income taxes; and depreciation and amortization to net income. In calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per diluted share, the Company further adjusts for stock-based compensation expense. As stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that can vary significantly based on the timing, size and nature of awards granted, the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense can assist investors in comparisons of Company operating results with other peer companies because (i) the amount of such expense in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and (ii) such expense can vary significantly between periods as a result of the timing of grants of new stock-based awards, including inducement grants in connection with hiring. Additionally, the Company believes that excluding stock-based compensation from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per diluted share assists management and investors in making meaningful comparisons between the Company’s operating performance and the operating performance of other companies that may use different forms of employee compensation or different valuation methodologies for their stock-based compensation. Investors should note that stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to employees whose efforts contributed to the operating results in the periods presented and are expected to contribute to operating results in future periods. Investors should also note that such expenses will recur in the future. \n\nThe Company also presents certain financial information on a constant currency basis, which is intended to exclude the effects of foreign currency fluctuations. The Company conducts a significant part of its activities outside the U.S. It receives sales revenue and pays expenses principally in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs, Japanese yen and euros. The exchange rates between dollars and non-U.S. currencies can fluctuate greatly and can have a significant effect on the Company’s results when reported in U.S. dollars. In order to compare the Company's performance from period to period without the effect of currency, the Company will apply the same average exchange rate applicable in the prior period, or the “constant currency” rate to sales or expenses in the current period as well. \n\nIn the tables provided below, the Company has included a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per diluted share to net income and net income per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as supplemental financial information with net sales expressed in constant currency. The Company has also provided a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per diluted share to net income and net income per diluted share. This represents forward-looking information, and actual results may vary. Please see the risks and assumptions referred to in the Safe Harbor section of this press release. \n\n** About STAAR Surgical **\n\nSTAAR, which has been dedicated solely to ophthalmic surgery for over 40 years, designs, develops, manufactures and markets implantable lenses for the eye.

Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the recent shift in fiscal policy and announced stimulus in China and will continue to closely monitor the potential impact on our near to midterm growth outlook.” \n\nMr. Frinzi concluded, “Our focus on customer engagement and market expansion continues to yield solid results, helping drive industry-leading growth and market share gains. As our surgeon customers perform more EVO procedures, they are increasingly using our technology for moderate myopia, which underscores EVO ICL as the treatment choice for -6D and above and expands our total addressable market.” \n\n** Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results **\n\nNet sales were $88.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, up 10% from $80.3 million reported in the prior year quarter. This sales increase was driven by ICL sales growth of $8.0 million, up 10%, and unit growth of 6% from the prior year period. Other Product sales declined $0.2 million from the prior year period. Changes in currency, primarily the Japanese Yen, negatively impacted reported total net sales by $0.3 million for the third quarter of 2024. \n\nGross profit margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 77.3% of net sales as compared to the prior year quarter of 79.2% of net sales. Gross margin in the third quarter was lower primarily due to reduced unit production that resulted in less absorption of fixed overhead. \n\nOperating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $62.8 million, up from the prior year quarter of $57.3 million. General and administrative expenses were $21.7 million, up from $19.3 million in the prior year quarter, driven primarily by increased facility costs and compensation-related expenses. Selling and marketing expenses were $26.6 million – consistent with the prior year quarter. Research and development expenses were $14.5 million, up from the prior year quarter of $11.5 million, primarily due to purchases of in-process research and development, as well as compensation-related expenses, which were partially offset by lower clinical trial costs. \n\nOperating income for the third quarter of 2024 was $5.7 million or 6.4% of net sales as compared to operating income of $6.3 million or 7.8% of net sales for the third quarter of 2023. \n\nNet income for the third quarter of 2024 was $10.0 million or $0.20 income per share, up from $4.8 million or $0.10 income per share for the prior year quarter. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to a gain on foreign currency transactions. \n\nAs of September 27, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and investments available for sale totaled $236.0 million, up from $232.4 million on December 29, 2023. \n\n** Outlook **\n\nThe Company maintained its prior outlook for fiscal year 2024 net sales and Adjusted EBITDA. \n\n  * Net sales of $340 million to $345 million. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $42 million and Adjusted EBITDA per diluted share of approximately $0.80. \n\n\n\nThe outlook above contemplates EVO ICL sales growth of 17% in the Americas (prior outlook was 15%) including 20% in the U.S. (prior outlook was 25%); EMEA sales growth of 10% (prior outlook was 6%); and APAC sales growth of 4% (prior outlook was 7%), including approximately 2% growth in China (prior outlook was 10%). \n\n** Earnings Webcast **\n\nThe Company will host an earnings webcast today, Wednesday, October 30 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern / 1:30 p.m. Pacific to discuss its financial results and operational progress. To access the webcast please use the following link: [https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=fmU0YbKB](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fevent.choruscall.com%2Fmediaframe%2Fwebcast.html%3Fwebcastid%3DfmU0YbKB&esheet=54144790&newsitemid=20241030604379&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fevent.choruscall.com%2Fmediaframe%2Fwebcast.html%3Fwebcastid%3DfmU0YbKB&index=1&md5=f5e50e732f26ba42a44871b62ca66e01). \n\nThe live webcast, earnings webcast presentation and an archived version of the webcast can be accessed from the investor relations section of the STAAR website at [www.staar.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.staar.com&esheet=54144790&newsitemid=20241030604379&lan=en-US&anchor=www.staar.com&index=2&md5=4b200ce94696ddf3ff9230150259f9ac). \n\n** Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures **\n\nTo supplement the Company’s financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this press release and the accompanying tables include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its evaluation of Company operating performance and believes investors will find them useful in evaluating the Company’s operating performance, including cash flow generation, and in analyzing period-to-period financial performance of core business operations and underlying business trends. Non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. \n\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is calculated by adding interest income and expense, net; provision for income taxes; and depreciation and amortization to net income. In calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per diluted share, the Company further adjusts for stock-based compensation expense. As stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that can vary significantly based on the timing, size and nature of awards granted, the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense can assist investors in comparisons of Company operating results with other peer companies because (i) the amount of such expense in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and (ii) such expense can vary significantly between periods as a result of the timing of grants of new stock-based awards, including inducement grants in connection with hiring. Additionally, the Company believes that excluding stock-based compensation from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per diluted share assists management and investors in making meaningful comparisons between the Company’s operating performance and the operating performance of other companies that may use different forms of employee compensation or different valuation methodologies for their stock-based compensation. Investors should note that stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to employees whose efforts contributed to the operating results in the periods presented and are expected to contribute to operating results in future periods. Investors should also note that such expenses will recur in the future. \n\nThe Company also presents certain financial information on a constant currency basis, which is intended to exclude the effects of foreign currency fluctuations. The Company conducts a significant part of its activities outside the U.S. It receives sales revenue and pays expenses principally in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs, Japanese yen and euros. The exchange rates between dollars and non-U.S. currencies can fluctuate greatly and can have a significant effect on the Company’s results when reported in U.S. dollars. In order to compare the Company's performance from period to period without the effect of currency, the Company will apply the same average exchange rate applicable in the prior period, or the “constant currency” rate to sales or expenses in the current period as well. \n\nIn the tables provided below, the Company has included a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per diluted share to net income and net income per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as supplemental financial information with net sales expressed in constant currency. The Company has also provided a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per diluted share to net income and net income per diluted share. This represents forward-looking information, and actual results may vary. Please see the risks and assumptions referred to in the Safe Harbor section of this press release. \n\n** About STAAR Surgical **\n\nSTAAR, which has been dedicated solely to ophthalmic surgery for over 40 years, designs, develops, manufactures and markets implantable lenses for the eye.

These lenses are intended to provide visual freedom for patients, lessening or eliminating the reliance on glasses or contact lenses. All of these lenses are foldable, which permits the surgeon to insert them through a small incision.

The risks and uncertainties include the\nfollowing: global economic conditions; the impact of COVID-19; the discretion of regulatory agencies to approve or reject existing, new or improved\nproducts, or to require additional actions before or after approval, or to take enforcement action; international conflicts, trade disputes and substantial\ndependence on demand from Asia; and the willingness of surgeons and patients to adopt a new or improved product and procedure.\nWe intend to use our website as a means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with our disclosure obligations under\nRegulation FD. Such disclosures will be included on our website in the ‘Investor Relations’ sections. Accordingly, investors should monitor such\nportions of our website, in addition to following our presentations, SEC filings and public conference calls and webcasts.\n03\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nTo supplement the Company’s financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this presentation and\nthe accompanying tables include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA. Management uses these non- GAAP financial measures in its\nevaluation of Company operating performance and believes investors will find them useful in evaluating the Company’s operating performance, including cash flow\ngeneration, and in analyzing period-to-period financial performance of core business operations and underlying business trends. Non-GAAP financial measures are\nin addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is calculated by adding interest income and expense, net; provision for income taxes; and depreciation and amortization\nto net income. In calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per diluted share, the Company further adjusts for stock-based compensation expense. As stock-\nbased compensation is a non-cash expense that can vary significantly based on the timing, size and nature of awards granted, the Company believes that the exclusion\nof stock-based compensation expense can assist investors in comparisons of Company operating results with other peer companies because (i) the amount of\nsuch expense in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and (ii) such expense can vary\nsignificantly between periods as a result of the timing of grants of new stock- based awards, including inducement grants in connection with hiring. Additionally, the\nCompany believes that excluding stock-based compensation from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per diluted share assists management and investors in\nmaking meaningful comparisons between the Company’s operating performance and the operating performance of other companies that may use different forms\nof employee compensation or different valuation methodologies for their stock-based compensation. Investors should note that stock-based compensation is a key\nincentive offered to employees whose efforts contributed to the operating results in the periods presented and are expected to contribute to operating results in future\nperiods. Investors should also note that such expenses will recur in the future.\nThe Company also presents certain financial information on a constant currency basis, which is intended to exclude the effects of foreign currency fluctuations. The\nCompany conducts a significant part of its activities outside the U.S. It receives sales revenue and pays expenses principally in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs, Japanese yen and\neuros. The exchange rates between dollars and non-U.S. currencies can fluctuate greatly and can have a significant effect on the Company’s results when reported in U.S.\ndollars. In order to compare the Company's performance from period to period without the effect of currency, the Company will apply the same average exchange rate\napplicable in the prior period, or the “constant currency” rate to sales or expenses in the current period as well.\nIn the appendix to this presentation, the Company has included a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per diluted share to net income and net\nincome per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Company has also provided a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA\nand Adjusted EBITDA per diluted share to net income and net income per diluted share. This represents forward- looking information, and actual results may vary.\nPlease see the risks and assumptions referred to in the Forward Looking Statements section of this presentation.\n04\nTHIRD QUARTER 2024 EARNINGS PRESENTATION\nSTAAR Surgical + EVO ICL Around the World\n05\nThird Quarter 2024\nSTAAR / Q3 Results Reflect Continued Market Adoption & Share Gains\nEnhanced commercial focus and investments are driving growth\n$88.6M $340M - $345M $236.0M\nQ3’24 GAAP Fiscal 2024 Net Sales Outlook Cash and Cash Equivalents\nNet Sales Prior Outlook Maintained* as of Sep. 27, 2024\nIn the third quarter, we achieved double-digit sales\nOur recent investments in customer education,\ngrowth against a macroeconomic environment\nthat softened in the second half of the quarter, innovative tools and comprehensive practice\n10%\nparticularly in China.

Tom?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nThomas G. Frinzi\nChair of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, STAAR Surgical Co.\nThank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. In the third quarter, we achieved net sales of $88.6 million and\ndouble-digit sales growth against a macroeconomic environment that softened in the second half of the quarter,\nparticularly in China. Our results reflect the increased global adoption and market share gains of EVO ICL lenses,\nthe positive returns on our investments in commercial programs, our customer focused initiatives, and the global\ndiversity of our business.\nFor fiscal year 2024, we are maintaining our financial outlook and continue to anticipate net sales of\napproximately $340 million to $345 million.\nDuring the third quarter, we celebrated the grand opening of our new EVO ICL Experience Center at our Lake\nForest, Southern California headquarters. Importantly, this new center includes cutting-edge technology and\nworkstations for approximately 60 individuals, nearly 10 times the capacity of our previous center. Designed as a\nstate-of-the-art learning environment for surgeons, healthcare staff and STAAR employees, our goal is for the\ncenter to help facilitate practice efficiencies, enhance patient care and increase ICL adoption. We will be offering\na number of training and education programs, including lens size selection and pre-operative case management,\npatient acquisition and practice development with capabilities to livestream surgeries from key sites.\nIn October alone, our teams hosted a getting started program as a comprehensive ICL boot camp for newly\ntrained surgeons in the US and Canada, a group of surgeons from Japan and a summit for approximately two\ndozen optometrists employed within our US Highway 93 customers. By year-end, we will launch at least 10\nprograms at this new center of excellence.\nEarlier in the quarter, we attended the 42nd Annual Congress of the European Society of Cataract, Refractive\nSurgeons, ESCRS, in Barcelona, Spain, a key meeting attended by leading surgeons from around the world. We\nwere encouraged by the more than 80 papers and presentations that were presented relating to ICL technology,\nand even more pleased to find that a number of surgeons shared that they view EVO ICL as the choice for minus\n6 diopters and above. This increased confidence is a direct reflection of the investments we have made\nthroughout 2024 to advance the education, training and ICL understanding of our surgeon customers. We are\nconfident that this positive feedback from surgeons will help position ICL as the preferred choice among patients,\nespecially as we advance our lower diopter strategies to expand our total addressable market.\n3\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSTAAR Surgical Co.\n(STAA) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nNow turning to our performance by region. In the Americas, we generated sales growth of 14% in the third\nquarter. The US refractive market was much more challenging than we anticipated in the quarter, down 18% year-\nover-year. STAAR significantly outpaced the market, growing US sales 16% year-over-year. In the third quarter,\nwe signed three additional Fast Lane agreements as part of our US Highway 93 commercial strategy. We now\nhave 12 Fast Lane customers, and these Fast Lane customers commit on average 23% of their refractive\nprocedure mix in the first year of the agreement. For the third quarter of 2024, the 8 Fast Lane customers with at\nleast one full quarter of sales under their belt delivered 61% ICL sales growth.\nIn EMEA, we generated 12% sales growth in the quarter, driven primarily by the Middle East and European\ndistributor markets. We are energized by the outperformance of our EMEA region this year, in particular relative to\nour initial outlook and believe we will continue to benefit from our investments in this important market.\nIn APAC, the largest market in the world for refractive procedures, in our largest region for sales, we generated\nsales growth of 9% in the third quarter. China sales were up 7% and ICL unit growth was positive. However, the\nhigh season started strong, but the macroeconomic climate in China declined following our Q2 earnings report in\nAugust. We continued to outpace the market and deliver sales and unit growth in this key market, but the\nmomentum that we saw early in the quarter certainly tapered as we moved through Q3.\nTurning to Japan. We continued to gain share with sales growth of 15%. Our Japan business has generated\ndouble-digit unit growth in 32 of the last 35 quarters, which we believe is a testament not only to the talent of our\nteam, but the support we continue to receive from key opinion leaders in the region.\nIn South Korea, we generated 11% sales growth in the third quarter, boosted by the strength of South Korea's first\nICL only clinic, which is on track to implant over 2,000 lenses this year.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Patrick to review our financial results. After Patrick discusses the\nfinancials, I will update you on our additional growth initiatives and outlook. Patrick?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPatrick F. Williams\nChief Financial Officer, STAAR Surgical Co.\nThank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. Total net sales for Q3 2024 increased 10% to $88.6 million, up\nfrom $80.3 million in the prior year quarter. This $8.3 million increase is largely attributable to the $8 million or\n10% increase in ICL sales and $0.2 million decrease in other products.\nConstant currency net sales for Q3 2024 were $88.9 million, also up 10% as compared to prior year period. For\nQ3 2024, gross profit was $68.5 million or 77.3% of net sales as compared to $63.6 million or 79.2% of net sales\nin the year ago period. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was primarily due to reduced unit production\nthat resulted in less absorption of fixed overhead. For the full year, we now expect gross profit margin to be\napproximately 79%, down 1 point from our previous estimate.\nMoving down the income statement, total operating expenses for Q3 2024 increased 10% to $62.8 million, up\nfrom $57.3 million in Q3 2023 and down from $66.5 million in Q2 2024. The sequential decrease in operating\nexpenses reflects a shift in the timing of some spend that we now expect to occur in Q4 2024.\nTaking a closer look at the components of operating expenses, G&A expense for Q3 2024 was $21.7 million, up\nfrom $19.3 million in the prior year quarter and down from $23.6 million in Q2 2024. This year-over-year increase\n4\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSTAAR Surgical Co.\n(STAA) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nis primarily due to increased facilities costs and compensation-related expenses. For Q4 2024, we continue to\nexpect G&A expense to be approximately $24 million.\nSelling and marketing expense was $26.6 million for both Q3 2024 and the prior year quarter, down from $28.8\nmillion in Q2 2024. The lower than planned selling and marketing in the quarter was due to timing of marketing,\npromotion and advertising activities, most of which we expect to carry over to Q4. We also incurred a $1.6 million\nnon-cash write-off related to our former EVO Experience Center. For Q4 2024, we now expect selling and\nmarketing expense to be approximately $32 million.\nResearch and development expense was $14.5 million for Q3 2024, up from $11.5 million in the prior year quarter\nand up from $14.1 million in Q2 2024. This year-over-year increase in R&D is primarily due to purchases of in-\nprocess R&D related to external AI tools for measurement and lens site selection, as well as compensation-\nrelated expenses, which were partially offset by lower clinical trial costs. For Q4 2024, we continue to expect R&D\nexpense to be approximately $15 million.\nFor Q3 2024, GAAP net income was $10 million or $0.20 earnings per diluted share, up from $4.8 million or $0.10\nearnings per diluted share in the prior year quarter. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to higher\nsales and a gain on foreign currency transactions, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA\nfor Q3 2024 was $16.2 million or $0.33 per diluted share as compared to $16.5 million or $0.33 per diluted share\nin the prior year quarter.\nTurning now to our balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter, our cash, cash equivalents and investments\navailable for sale were $236 million, up from $232.4 million in December 2023, giving STAAR significant flexibility\nto make a range of capital allocation decisions. We also have significant future cash receipts, as shown in our\naccounts receivable balance. In fact, as of this week, our accounts receivable balance is already down to\napproximately $85 million, and moving forward, we expect our DSO to moderate around 90 days. For fiscal 2024,\nwe continue to expect CapEx of approximately $30 million for the full year, which includes approximately $10\nmillion of ERP-related projects, which is currently recorded as other assets on our cash flow statement.\nAs Tom said, we are maintaining both our fiscal 2024 sales outlook and adjusted EBITDA outlook. A reconciliation\nof non-GAAP financial measures is shown in today's earnings press release and earnings presentation. For\nmodeling purposes, please refer to slide 16 of this earnings presentation for additional details and specific line\nitem updates. We look forward to meeting many of you in the days and weeks ahead. A list of upcoming investor\nmeetings and activities can be found on our investor website under Upcoming Events.\nAnd now, back to Tom.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nThomas G. Frinzi\nChair of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, STAAR Surgical Co.\nThank you, Patrick. As I noted at the top of the call, I am incredibly proud of the progress we made in the third\nquarter to advance our market building initiatives, drive EVO ICL uptake and reinforce the significant opportunity\nin front of us. Every day, we actively respond to the market, our customers and the growing need for myopia\nsolutions.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we are maintaining our fiscal 2024 outlook. You will note the composition of our sales\noutlook has changed, which reflects both the dynamic macroeconomic environment and the growing global\ndiversity of our business. As set forth in today's press release in the earnings presentation slides, some regions\nare growing more than anticipated, while growth expectations for other regions have softened.\n5\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSTAAR Surgical Co.\n(STAA) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nThe macroeconomic landscape in China is particularly dynamic right now, which we believe is transitory. We are\nencouraged by the recent shift in China's fiscal policy and announced stimulus, and we will continue to closely\nmonitor the potential impact on consumer sentiment and our sales. For example, we saw a positive uplift in ICL\nend-market sales, our proxy for implant procedures during Golden Week in early October, following the stimulus\nannouncement on September 24.\nSTAAR is well positioned to weather the current market dynamics. We remain profitable, backed by a strong\nbalance sheet. While we are not providing 2025 outlook today, we remain confident in STAAR's long-term growth\nand the tremendous opportunity for EVO. STAAR's Collamer material continues to be unique and well positioned\nwith very high levels of surgeon and patient satisfaction. Additionally, our total addressable market is only\nincreasing as myopia is a growing healthcare issue and is certainly not going away. We continue to build surgeon\nconfidence in measurement and lens-size selection. And as that surgeon confidence builds, their commitment to\nEVO as well as their commitment to coming down the diopter curve increases, which is consistent with our stated\ngoal of being the choice for minus 6 diopters and above.\nAnd finally, we are in the process of rebuilding our pipeline to deliver next-generation technology that will continue\nto provide the quality as well as quantity of vision our demographic demands. STAAR is laying the foundation for\ngrowth to create not only a good company today, but a great company for tomorrow.\nAnd with that, operator, we'll now take questions.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today\ncomes from Tom Stephan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nThomas M. Stephan Q\nAnalyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nGreat. Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. Maybe I'll start with 2025. When I look at Street numbers, they're\nmodeling, I think, low-teens growth next year. So, obviously a lot of very fluid macro dynamics. But when I look at\nthe midpoint of this year's guide, it implies maybe low-single digit growth in the fourth quarter. So, Tom, I know\nyou said you're not going to be providing guidance, but can you just help us think about what 2025 growth should\nlook like, either relative to that 4Q exit and/or maybe the mid-to-high single digit growth that you're tracking toward\nfor the full year in 2024? And then I have a follow-up.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nThomas G. Frinzi A\nChair of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, STAAR Surgical Co.\nSure. Thanks, Tom, and appreciate the question. Look, I think it'd be premature, as we said in the prepared\ncomments, to comment on 2025 outlook at this time. But as you know, we have a history of outpacing the market\nand continue to feel confident in our ability to do so. We have been and will continue to be a growth-oriented\ncompany with a strong track record and are exceptionally pleased with our performance to-date.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nThomas M. Stephan Q\nAnalyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\n6\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSTAAR Surgical Co.\n(STAA) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nGot it. That's fair. And then maybe to zero in on China, I think the updated guidance implies – hopefully my math\nhere is right, but roughly down 10% to 15% growth in the fourth quarter. Can you just elaborate on the trends\nyou're seeing? What kind of transpired, let's call it, intra-quarter, and then, I guess maybe some of the, I guess,\n4Q to-date trends? Thanks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nThomas G. Frinzi A\nChair of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, STAAR Surgical Co.\nYeah. Sure, Tom. Again, appreciate the question. And consistent with what you heard in our prepared remarks,\nthe second half of the high season certainly changed. Sales tapered off following the Q2 earnings call in early\nAugust. And I think August and September were challenging, but we continued even in that environment to gain\nmarket share and outpace the market. Again, we believe these headwinds are transitory and we're encouraged by\nthe stimulus and economic packages that the China government is speaking about, and we're monitoring it\nclosely.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nThomas M. Stephan Q\nAnalyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nGot it. Thanks, Tom.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Please go ahead.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nRyan Zimmerman Q\nAnalyst, BTIG LLC\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking our questions and appreciate all the disclosures. It's very helpful. I want to ask\non the US first, actually. If I look at numbers for your US business relative to laser vision correction, it was really\nsteady to 2Q at about 4% penetration by our estimate. It's grown the last six quarters prior. So, Tom, I'm just\nwondering if there's anything to call out here. Would you expect that to keep growing, given that you did take\ndown the US guidance and just how to think about that trajectory, particularly in the US?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nThomas G. Frinzi A\nChair of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, STAAR Surgical Co.\nWell, look, as we stated, Ryan, we're pleased with what is happening in the US market. When you think of laser\nvision correction, broadly defined being down 18% in the quarter, we grew 16%. We're very pleased with that type\nof performance. In particular within our Highway 93 initiative, we signed a couple of new Fast Lane accounts. And\nwhen we look at those accounts that have had a full quarter under their belt, and the fact again, as we said in our\nprepared remarks, we see really nice growth within those accounts, it certainly encourages us that we are taking\nshare, we're outpacing the market, and we're well-positioned to have continued, sustainable growth in this second\nlargest market in refractive surgery around the world.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nRyan Zimmerman Q\nAnalyst, BTIG LLC\nOkay. And then just to follow-up on your comments, Tom, you said you were confident in the long-term growth\noutlook. Are we to read that as kind of reaffirming your long-range plans that you laid out at your Capital Markets\nDay last year? And just I'm curious what you're assuming either from a timing standpoint or a contribution from\nstimulus in China, if you have any thoughts on that.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n7\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSTAAR Surgical Co.\n(STAA) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nThomas G. Frinzi A\nChair of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, STAAR Surgical Co.\nLook, it – Ryan, I appreciate the question of trying to get me to comment on something that I've said is probably\npremature for us to comment, so.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nRyan Zimmerman Q\nAnalyst, BTIG LLC\nYeah.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nThomas G. Frinzi A\nChair of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, STAAR Surgical Co.\nLook, I – I'm encouraged by what we are hearing on the ground from our people in China. Golden Week was a\nnice opportunity to see some uptick in consumer spending. So stimulus is beginning to have an impact. We've\nindicated that we think those issues are transitory. And look, we have a history, whether you go back to 2021,\n2023, that the China market can turn very quickly. And we continue to believe we're well positioned in that market,\nwe're well received within that market. And as it turns, we are in a great position to take advantage of it and\ncontinue to grow and outpace the market.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nRyan Zimmerman Q\nAnalyst, BTIG LLC\nThank you, Tom.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nThomas G. Frinzi A\nChair of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, STAAR Surgical Co.\nThank you, Ryan.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: The next question comes from Anthony Petrone with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDimitri Tahal Q\nAnalyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC\nHey, guys. This is Dimitri Tahal on for Anthony. He's jumping around in the conference [indiscernible] (00:23:59).\nBut I just wanted to ask again, a little touch on China. Ask on how are the trends for distributor stocking in China\nlooking? And if we can look at the scheduled volumes at your group? And for a follow-up, is the – what's the US\noutlook for when the underlying refractive market can stabilize? Do we see it maybe returning to mid-single digit\ngrowth next year?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nThomas G. Frinzi A\nChair of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, STAAR Surgical Co.\nYes, I understand the nature of the question. Again, I'd refer you back to our prepared comments. We certainly\nindicated that the high season did slow down in China as we exited August and September. So we do have\nslightly more inventory in the channel because of that downturn, but we think it's an appropriate level. And as that\nmarket turns, we believe that will be a pull through at the appropriate level.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPatrick F. Williams A\nChief Financial Officer, STAAR Surgical Co.\n8\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSTAAR Surgical Co.\n(STAA) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nAnd then the question on US related...\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDimitri Tahal Q\nAnalyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC\nYeah.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPatrick F. Williams A\nChief Financial Officer, STAAR Surgical Co.\n...to our assumptions, underlying volume. Look, we've contemplated that clearly Q3 was down again. And what\nyou see reflected in our guidance that we spoke about of reducing the full year to 20% contemplates a bit of a\ncontinued downturn in the overall laser vision correction. But as we said, we continue to take market share and\ngrow. And EVO is doing an amazing job out there. And if anything, we're expanding the TAM with our doctors and\nwe're getting more and more on board.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDimitri Tahal Q\nAnalyst, Mizuho Securities USA LLC\nOkay. Thanks a lot.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: The next question comes from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPatrick Wood Q\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc\nPerfect. Thank you. Just one quick one. I guess, for China, where the volumes have been a bit slower, what do\nyou think has happened to these patients? And the reason I ask is, is there an effect where they've delayed\nhaving a procedure, they are waiting? And then if let's just say the stimulus comes back, you get an effective – I\ndon't want to say a bolus of volumes, but is that a way to think about it? Did that happen in the US historically? I\nknow LASIK was a little bit difficult [ph] 2008 (00:26:20), but is there an effect of delayed patients that come\nthrough in a lump, or do you think that they've just gone up and treated it or just decided not to go for refractive\nsurgery at all?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nThomas G. Frinzi A\nChair of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, STAAR Surgical Co.\nHey, Patrick. Yeah, I – again, I think it's a great question. And I think those patients are still there. And as I said\nearlier, look, we've seen in the past, China demand can come back very quickly. Fiscal year 2021, first quarter\n2023, following stimulus type activity, the market returned pretty quickly. So I think those patients are there. And\nas consumer sentiment changes, again, as I said, our – we're very well respected in that market. I think we're very\nwell positioned in that market. We have a lot of surgeon support. And as that economy turns, I think it's\nreasonable to assume volumes pick back up rather quickly.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nPatrick Wood Q\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc\nLove it. Thanks for taking the question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: The next question comes from Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n9\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSTAAR Surgical Co.\n(STAA) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nQ\nHey, this is [ph] Phil (00:27:34) on for Matt. Thanks for taking our questions. Just wanted to start with EMEA,\nwhere you brought up sales guidance to 10% from 6%, which is really outstanding, given this backdrop. Any\nspecific countries of strength to call out and any commentary on why the refractive market growth in these\ncountries might be a little bit different than what we're seeing domestically and over in China?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nThomas G. Frinzi A\nChair of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, STAAR Surgical Co.\nYeah. Look, I thank you for recognizing the strong performance by our EMEA team. As we said in our prepared\nremarks, certainly our distributor markets in Middle East were very strong. But we've also seen nice work in the\nUK, in Spain, in Germany where we're direct, and we're really encouraged. Much like we have a Highway 93\ninitiative in the US, we have what our team there refers to as an Autobahn 50. And certainly within those targeted\ncustomers, we have an all hands on deck type approach, and we're seeing nice growth there and very pleased\nwith our performance in what has been a very nice market for us.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nQ\nThat's helpful. And then one follow-up on China, and I know we talked a lot about it today, but just an update on\nthe competitive landscape over there in both the implantable lens category that you play in as well as other laser-\nbased procedure offerings more specifically, are you seeing any pressure due to the Smile price adjustments?\nThank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nThomas G. Frinzi A\nChair of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, STAAR Surgical Co.\nYeah. I think, again, good questions embedded in there. And as I've said in the past, I think competition is a\nhealthy thing. It certainly validates the market. Imitation is the highest form of flattery. So, certainly, we're aware of\ncompetition coming. We welcome the opportunity because I think all boats rise. It validates the market, will help\ngrow the market as more people are out there talking about it. But we think we're very well positioned.\nEyebright is probably a company closest to come to the market in China. We think based upon what they've said\npublicly, probably sometime in 2025, they'll hit the market. But again, their material, acrylic versus our polymer\nmaterial, we think we have an advantage. The fact that they won't have a toric version, and we do, I think another\nadvantage to us. But we're keeping our ears and eyes open and certainly will be prepared, particularly as we\nintroduce our V5 technology in that market probably by mid-2025.\nWe think if price becomes an issue in the market, we have a real stratification opportunity, both by customer and\nby product to compete favorably. But in general, the latter part of your question about laser vision correction,\nyeah, we've seen it particularly in China that there has been some price compression on the LVC side. But again,\nwe believe our product should maintain a premium because we produce a premium outcome. One could argue\nhow great of a premium, and what we've seen in reality is somewhere in the $1,500 to $2,000 per eye premium is\nappropriate for the outcome we produce from a quality of vision and quantity of vision point of view. And\ncustomers are inclined to step up to that extra premium, and where that's taken place, we've seen uptick in\nvolume.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n10\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nSTAAR Surgical Co.\n(STAA) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nQ\nHelpful.
