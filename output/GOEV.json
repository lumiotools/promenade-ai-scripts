(Nasdaq: GOEV), a high-tech advanced mobility company, today announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024.\n\n“We are grateful for the support of our customers, partners, their belief in us, and in our amazing product. While we focus on our core markets we must continue to take aggressive actions to consolidate our operations, reduce costs, and catch-up to our plan. This starts from the top led by a committed Executive team, which is willing to take short-term pay cuts for long-term incentives and believes in the value we create for our customers, associates and shareholders.” said Tony Aquila, Investor, Executive Chairman, and CEO. “This will continue to be a difficult and critical period as we do everything we can to get the capital in place, bring jobs back online, and get back on track with our step-level manufacturing plan.”\n\n**Third Quarter and Recent Business Updates:**\n\n  * North America realignment and relocation of corporate headquarters from California to Texas\n  * Consolidating our facilities from six to three, which has and will continue to impact our workforce until we are back on track with our step level manufacturing\n  * Achieved final activation of Oklahoma City facility Foreign Trade Zone\n  * UK Market: Established legal entity, launched commercial operations, received regulatory Individual Vehicle Approval with less than 2% changes to bill of materials, and signed service partners\n  * Commenced first pilot in the UK with one of the country’s largest fleet operators \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Highlights:**\n\n  * As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $16 million.\n  * GAAP net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) of $3 million and $(112) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss of $(112) million and $(274) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a gain of $62 million and gain of $101 million on the fair value change of the warrant and derivative liability, respectively.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $(38) million and $(125) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $(40) million and $(170) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * Adjusted Net Loss of $(43) million and $(143) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $(46) million and $(187) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * Adjusted EPS per share of $(0.54) and $(2.14) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $(1.71) and $(8.34) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * Net cash used in operating activities totaled $110 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $191 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * Net cash used in investing activities was $10 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $45 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * Net cash provided by financing activities was $115 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $209 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**Q4 2024 Business Outlook**\n\nBased on our current projections, Canoo expects the following guidance for Q4, 2024:\n\n  * Cash Outflow - $30 million to $40 million\n  * Adjusted EBITDA - $(30) million to $(35) million\n\n\n\nSee “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section herein for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for forward-looking guidance of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, because certain material reconciling items, such as depreciation and amortization and interest expense cannot be estimated due to factors outside of the Company's control and could have a material impact on the reported results. A reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nCanoo will host a conference call to discuss the results today, November 13, 2024, at 5:00 PM ET.\n\nTo listen to the conference call via telephone dial (877) 407-9169 (U.S.) and (201) 493-6755 (international callers/U.S. toll) and enter the conference ID number 13750015.

interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrant and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. \"Adjusted Net Loss\" is defined as net loss adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrants and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. \"Adjusted EPS\" is defined as Adjusted Net Loss on a per share basis using the weighted average shares outstanding.\n\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS are intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS when combined with net loss and net loss per share are beneficial to an investor’s complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS in the same fashion.\n\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS as supplemental performance measures.\n\n**CANOO INC.**\n\n**NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION TABLE****(in thousands)**\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures, when presented, are reconciled to the most closely comparable U.S. GAAP measure as disclosed below for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively (in thousands):\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n**EBITDA** | **Adjusted EBITDA** | **Adjusted Net Loss** | **EBITDA** | **Adjusted EBITDA** | **Adjusted Net Loss**  \nNet income (loss) | $ | 3,258 | $ | 3,258 | $ | 3,258 | $ | (111,974) | $ | (111,974) | $ | (111,974)  \nInterest expense (a) | 1,138 | 1,138 | — | 4,195 | 4,195 | —  \nProvision for income taxes | — | — | — | — | — | —  \nDepreciation | 3,752 | 3,752 | — | 1,495 | 1,495 | —  \nReorganization and related exit costs | — | 16,055 | 16,055 | — | — | —  \nGain on fair value change in contingent earnout shares liability | — | **—** | **—** | — | (279) | (279)  \nGain on fair value change in warrant and derivative liability | — | (61,771) | (61,771) | — | (17,126) | (17,126)  \nLoss on fair value change in derivative asset | — | — | — | 3,761 | 3,761  \nGain (Loss) on fair value change in convertible debt and other | — | (4,890) | (4,890) | — | 69,615 | 69,615  \nGain (Loss) on extinguishment of debt and other | — | 1,812 | 1,812 | — | 2,573 | 2,573  \nOther income (expense), net | — | 1 | 1 | — | 466 | 466  \nFinancing charges incurred upon issuance of PPAs | — | 1,260 | 1,260 | — | — | —  \nStock-based compensation | — | 1,647 | 1,647 | — | 6,908 | 6,908  \nAdjusted Non-GAAP amount | $ | 8,148 | $ | (37,737) | $ | (42,627) | $ | (106,284) | $ | (40,366) | $ | (46,056)  \n(a) Excluding $1,260 in non-recurring financing charges incurred upon issuance of PPAs shown separately above, as applicable, during 2024.  \nUS GAAP net income (loss) per share  \nBasic | N/A | N/A | $ | 0.03 | N/A | N/A | $ | (4.15)  \nDiluted | N/A | N/A | $ | (0.31) | N/A | N/A | $ | (4.15)  \nAdjusted Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share (Adjusted EPS):  \nBasic | N/A | N/A | $ | (0.54) | N/A | N/A | $ | (1.71)  \nDiluted | N/A | N/A | $ | (0.54) | N/A | N/A | $ | (1.71)  \nWeighted-average common shares outstanding:  \nDiluted | N/A | N/A | 93,004 | N/A | N/A | 27,012  \n**Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n**EBITDA** | **Adjusted EBITDA** | **Adjusted Net Loss** | **EBITDA** | **Adjusted EBITDA** | **Adjusted Net Loss**  \nNet income (loss) | (112,389) | (112,389) | (112,389) | $ | (273,576) | $ | (273,576) | $ | (273,576)  \nInterest expense (a) | 7,402 | 7,402 | — | 6,755 | 6,755 | —  \nProvision for income taxes | — | — | — | — | — | —  \nDepreciation (b) | 10,506 | 10,506 | — | 10,632 | 10,632 | —  \nReorganization and related exit costs | — | 16,055 | 16,055 | — | — | —  \nGain on fair value change in contingent earnout shares liability | — | (41) | (41) | — | (2,843) | (2,843)  \nGain on fair value change in warrant and derivative liability | — | (100,607) | (100,607) | — | (40,091) | (40,091)  \nLoss on fair value change in derivative asset | — | — | — | — | 3,761 | 3,761  \nGain (Loss) on fair value change in convertible debt and other | — | 62,226 | 62,226 | — | 69,615 | 69,615  \nGain (Loss) on extinguishment of debt and other | — | (22,650) | (22,650) | — | 30,261 | 30,261  \nOther income (expense), net | — | (1,141) | (1,141) | — | 2,256 | 2,256  \nFinancing charges incurred upon issuance of PPAs | — | 2,170 | 2,170 | — | — | —  \nStock-based compensation | — | 13,730 | 13,730 | — | 23,451 | 23,451  \nAdjusted Non-GAAP amount | $ | (94,481) | $ | (124,740) | $ | (142,648) | $ | (256,189) | $ | (169,779) | $ | (187,166)  \n(a) Excluding $2,170 in non-recurring financing charges incurred upon issuance of PPAs shown separately above, as applicable, during 2024.

Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “intend,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “seek,” “target” or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding access to capital, estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, expectations and timing related to commercial product launches and the achievement of operational milestones, including the ability to meet and/or accelerate anticipated production timelines, Canoo's ability to capitalize on commercial opportunities, current or anticipated customer orders, and expectations regarding the development of facilities. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Canoo’s management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Canoo. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; Canoo's ability to continue as a going concern; Canoo's ability to access existing and future sources of capital via debt or equity markets, which will impact execution of its business plans and could require Canoo to terminate or significantly curtail its operations; Canoo's history of losses; Canoo's ability to adequately control the costs associated with its operations; Canoo's ability to successfully build and tool its manufacturing facilities, establish or continue a relationship with a contract manufacturer or failure of operation of Canoo's facilities ; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy and manufacturing strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business, and those factors discussed under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Canoo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 1, 2024, as well as its past and future Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. If any of these risks materialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that Canoo does not presently know or that Canoo currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Canoo’s expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. Canoo anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Canoo’s assessments to change. However, while Canoo may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Canoo specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Canoo’s assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements.\n\n```\nContacts: Media Relations Press@canoo.com Investor Relations IR@canoo.com\n```\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/f9116fcf-0198-4b59-be66-1425d111c0c1/small/canoo-logoblk-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/f9116fcf-0198-4b59-be66-1425d111c0c1)\n\nSource: Canoo, Inc. \n\nReleased November 13, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/news-presentations/email-alerts)\n  * [Tear Sheet](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_17fe7ad8fecf2e8ea5265516d537a7dd/canoo/files/Tear+Sheet.pdf \"Tear Sheet\")\n  * [Contacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/rss)\n\n\n"

(Nasdaq: GOEV), a high-tech advanced mobility company, today announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024.\n\n“We are grateful for the support of our customers, partners, their belief in us, and in our amazing product. While we focus on our core markets we must continue to take aggressive actions to consolidate our operations, reduce costs, and catch-up to our plan. This starts from the top led by a committed Executive team, which is willing to take short-term pay cuts for long-term incentives and believes in the value we create for our customers, associates and shareholders.” said Tony Aquila, Investor, Executive Chairman, and CEO. “This will continue to be a difficult and critical period as we do everything we can to get the capital in place, bring jobs back online, and get back on track with our step-level manufacturing plan.”\n\n**Third Quarter and Recent Business Updates:**\n\n  * North America realignment and relocation of corporate headquarters from California to Texas\n  * Consolidating our facilities from six to three, which has and will continue to impact our workforce until we are back on track with our step level manufacturing\n  * Achieved final activation of Oklahoma City facility Foreign Trade Zone\n  * UK Market: Established legal entity, launched commercial operations, received regulatory Individual Vehicle Approval with less than 2% changes to bill of materials, and signed service partners\n  * Commenced first pilot in the UK with one of the country’s largest fleet operators \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Highlights:**\n\n  * As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $16 million.\n  * GAAP net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss) of $3 million and $(112) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss of $(112) million and $(274) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a gain of $62 million and gain of $101 million on the fair value change of the warrant and derivative liability, respectively.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $(38) million and $(125) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $(40) million and $(170) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * Adjusted Net Loss of $(43) million and $(143) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $(46) million and $(187) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * Adjusted EPS per share of $(0.54) and $(2.14) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $(1.71) and $(8.34) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * Net cash used in operating activities totaled $110 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $191 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * Net cash used in investing activities was $10 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $45 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * Net cash provided by financing activities was $115 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $209 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**Q4 2024 Business Outlook**\n\nBased on our current projections, Canoo expects the following guidance for Q4, 2024:\n\n  * Cash Outflow - $30 million to $40 million\n  * Adjusted EBITDA - $(30) million to $(35) million\n\n\n\nSee “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section herein for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for forward-looking guidance of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, because certain material reconciling items, such as depreciation and amortization and interest expense cannot be estimated due to factors outside of the Company's control and could have a material impact on the reported results. A reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nCanoo will host a conference call to discuss the results today, November 13, 2024, at 5:00 PM ET.\n\nTo listen to the conference call via telephone dial (877) 407-9169 (U.S.) and (201) 493-6755 (international callers/U.S. toll) and enter the conference ID number 13750015.

interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrant and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. \"Adjusted Net Loss\" is defined as net loss adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrants and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. \"Adjusted EPS\" is defined as Adjusted Net Loss on a per share basis using the weighted average shares outstanding.\n\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS are intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS when combined with net loss and net loss per share are beneficial to an investor’s complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS in the same fashion.\n\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS as supplemental performance measures.\n\n**CANOO INC.**\n\n**NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION TABLE****(in thousands)**\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures, when presented, are reconciled to the most closely comparable U.S. GAAP measure as disclosed below for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively (in thousands):\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n**EBITDA** | **Adjusted EBITDA** | **Adjusted Net Loss** | **EBITDA** | **Adjusted EBITDA** | **Adjusted Net Loss**  \nNet income (loss) | $ | 3,258 | $ | 3,258 | $ | 3,258 | $ | (111,974) | $ | (111,974) | $ | (111,974)  \nInterest expense (a) | 1,138 | 1,138 | — | 4,195 | 4,195 | —  \nProvision for income taxes | — | — | — | — | — | —  \nDepreciation | 3,752 | 3,752 | — | 1,495 | 1,495 | —  \nReorganization and related exit costs | — | 16,055 | 16,055 | — | — | —  \nGain on fair value change in contingent earnout shares liability | — | **—** | **—** | — | (279) | (279)  \nGain on fair value change in warrant and derivative liability | — | (61,771) | (61,771) | — | (17,126) | (17,126)  \nLoss on fair value change in derivative asset | — | — | — | 3,761 | 3,761  \nGain (Loss) on fair value change in convertible debt and other | — | (4,890) | (4,890) | — | 69,615 | 69,615  \nGain (Loss) on extinguishment of debt and other | — | 1,812 | 1,812 | — | 2,573 | 2,573  \nOther income (expense), net | — | 1 | 1 | — | 466 | 466  \nFinancing charges incurred upon issuance of PPAs | — | 1,260 | 1,260 | — | — | —  \nStock-based compensation | — | 1,647 | 1,647 | — | 6,908 | 6,908  \nAdjusted Non-GAAP amount | $ | 8,148 | $ | (37,737) | $ | (42,627) | $ | (106,284) | $ | (40,366) | $ | (46,056)  \n(a) Excluding $1,260 in non-recurring financing charges incurred upon issuance of PPAs shown separately above, as applicable, during 2024.  \nUS GAAP net income (loss) per share  \nBasic | N/A | N/A | $ | 0.03 | N/A | N/A | $ | (4.15)  \nDiluted | N/A | N/A | $ | (0.31) | N/A | N/A | $ | (4.15)  \nAdjusted Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share (Adjusted EPS):  \nBasic | N/A | N/A | $ | (0.54) | N/A | N/A | $ | (1.71)  \nDiluted | N/A | N/A | $ | (0.54) | N/A | N/A | $ | (1.71)  \nWeighted-average common shares outstanding:  \nDiluted | N/A | N/A | 93,004 | N/A | N/A | 27,012  \n**Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n**EBITDA** | **Adjusted EBITDA** | **Adjusted Net Loss** | **EBITDA** | **Adjusted EBITDA** | **Adjusted Net Loss**  \nNet income (loss) | (112,389) | (112,389) | (112,389) | $ | (273,576) | $ | (273,576) | $ | (273,576)  \nInterest expense (a) | 7,402 | 7,402 | — | 6,755 | 6,755 | —  \nProvision for income taxes | — | — | — | — | — | —  \nDepreciation (b) | 10,506 | 10,506 | — | 10,632 | 10,632 | —  \nReorganization and related exit costs | — | 16,055 | 16,055 | — | — | —  \nGain on fair value change in contingent earnout shares liability | — | (41) | (41) | — | (2,843) | (2,843)  \nGain on fair value change in warrant and derivative liability | — | (100,607) | (100,607) | — | (40,091) | (40,091)  \nLoss on fair value change in derivative asset | — | — | — | — | 3,761 | 3,761  \nGain (Loss) on fair value change in convertible debt and other | — | 62,226 | 62,226 | — | 69,615 | 69,615  \nGain (Loss) on extinguishment of debt and other | — | (22,650) | (22,650) | — | 30,261 | 30,261  \nOther income (expense), net | — | (1,141) | (1,141) | — | 2,256 | 2,256  \nFinancing charges incurred upon issuance of PPAs | — | 2,170 | 2,170 | — | — | —  \nStock-based compensation | — | 13,730 | 13,730 | — | 23,451 | 23,451  \nAdjusted Non-GAAP amount | $ | (94,481) | $ | (124,740) | $ | (142,648) | $ | (256,189) | $ | (169,779) | $ | (187,166)  \n(a) Excluding $2,170 in non-recurring financing charges incurred upon issuance of PPAs shown separately above, as applicable, during 2024.

These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding access to capital, estimates and forecasts of financial and performance metrics, expectations and timing related to commercial product launches and the achievement of operational milestones, including the ability to meet and/or accelerate anticipated production timelines, Canoo's ability to capitalize on commercial opportunities, current or anticipated customer orders, and expectations regarding the development of facilities.

These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Canoo. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in domestic and foreign business, market, financial, political and legal conditions; Canoo's ability to continue as a going concern; Canoo's ability to access existing and future sources of capital via debt or equity markets, which will impact execution of its business plans and could require Canoo to terminate or significantly curtail its operations; Canoo's history of losses; Canoo's ability to adequately control the costs associated with its operations; Canoo's ability to successfully build and tool its manufacturing facilities, establish or continue a relationship with a contract manufacturer or failure of operation of Canoo's facilities ; the rollout of Canoo's business and the timing of expected business milestones and commercial launch; future market adoption of Canoo's offerings; risks related to Canoo's go-to-market strategy and manufacturing strategy; the effects of competition on Canoo's future business, and those factors discussed under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Canoo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 1, 2024, as well as its past and future Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Canoo's Investors Relations website at investors.canoo.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

Canoo anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Canoo’s assessments to change.
