The decrease in other income was driven primarily by a $1.1 million decrease in prepayment fee income and a $0.9 million decrease in dividend income quarter over quarter.\n\nTotal expenses decreased by $0.5 million, or 4.0%, quarter over quarter primarily due to a $0.5 million decrease in the net incentive fee, driven by lower pre-incentive fee net investment income quarter over quarter.\n\nNet investment income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $11.0 million, or $0.50 per share.\n\nThe net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $31.8 million, or $1.46 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $19.1 million, or $0.88 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The current quarter increase in net assets resulting from operations was primarily driven by $20.8 million of net unrealized appreciation recognized during the quarter.\n\n**Fiscal Year Ended 2024 Results:**\n\nTotal investment income during the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $96.6 million and $86.4 million, respectively. The year over year increase was primarily due to a $10.3 million increase in interest income, driven by an increase in the weighted average principal balance of our interest-bearing investment portfolio of $39.0 million, or 6.2%, year over year, and an increase in the weighted average yield from 13.3% during the year ended September 30, 2023 to 13.9% during the year ended September 30, 2024.\n\nExpenses, net of any non-contractual, unconditional and irrevocable credits to fees from the Adviser, increased $5.1 million, or 11.3%, for the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to a $2.0 million increase in the net base management fee, a $1.0 million increase in the net incentive fee, and a $0.9 million increase in interest expense.\n\nNet investment income for the year ended September 30, 2024 was $46.1 million, an increase of 12.3%, as compared to the prior year, or $2.11 per share.\n\nThe net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $94.5 million, or $4.34 per share, for the year ended September 30, 2024, compared to $42.7 million, or $2.29 per share, for the year ended September 30, 2023. The current year increase was driven by net investment income of $46.1 million, $42.7 million in net unrealized appreciation, and $6.0 million in net realized gains.\n\n**Subsequent Events:** Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the following significant events occurred:\n\n  * **Portfolio Activity:**\n\n    * In October 2024, our debt investment in Perimeter Solutions Group paid off at par for net cash proceeds of $15.5 million, including a $0.5 million prepayment penalty.\n\n    * In October 2024, our investment in Antenna Research Associates, Inc. was sold, which resulted in a realized gain of approximately $59.3 million and the repayment of our debt investment of $31.3 million at par.\n\n    * In November 2024, we invested an additional $28.9 million in Giving Home Health Care, LLC, an existing portfolio company, through secured first lien debt.\n\n\n\n\n  * **Distributions and Dividends Declared:**\n\n    * In October 2024, our Board of Directors declared the following distributions to common and preferred stockholders:\n\n\n**Record Date** | **Payment Date** | **Distribution per Common Share**  \n---|---|---  \nOctober 22, 2024 | October 31, 2024 | **$** | **0.165**  \nNovember 20, 2024 | November 29, 2024 | 0.165  \nDecember 20, 2024 | December 31, 2024 | 0.165  \n**Total for the Quarter** | **$** | **0.495**  \n  \n**Record Date** | **Payment Date** | **Distribution per Series A Preferred Stock**  \n---|---|---  \nOctober 24, 2024 | November 4, 2024 | $ | 0.130208  \nNovember 27, 2024 | December 4, 2024 | 0.130208  \nDecember 23, 2024 | January 3, 2025 | 0.130208  \n**Total for the Quarter** | **$** | **0.390624**  \n  \n  * In November 2024, our Board of Directors declared the following supplemental distribution to common stockholders:\n\n\n\n\n**Record Date** | **Payment Date** | **Distribution per Common Share**  \n---|---|---  \nDecember 4, 2024 | December 18, 2024 | **$** | **0.40**  \n  \n**Comments from Gladstone Capital's President, Bob Marcotte:** \"We are pleased to report the successful exit of our largest investment position after the end of the quarter at a material gain, a portion of which is reflected in the supplemental distribution recently announced.

The decrease in other income was driven primarily by a $1.1 million decrease in prepayment fee income and a $0.9 million decrease in dividend income quarter over quarter.\n\nTotal expenses decreased by $0.5 million, or 4.0%, quarter over quarter primarily due to a $0.5 million decrease in the net incentive fee, driven by lower pre-incentive fee net investment income quarter over quarter.\n\nNet investment income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $11.0 million, or $0.50 per share.\n\nThe net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $31.8 million, or $1.46 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $19.1 million, or $0.88 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The current quarter increase in net assets resulting from operations was primarily driven by $20.8 million of net unrealized appreciation recognized during the quarter.\n\n**Fiscal Year Ended 2024 Results:**\n\nTotal investment income during the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $96.6 million and $86.4 million, respectively. The year over year increase was primarily due to a $10.3 million increase in interest income, driven by an increase in the weighted average principal balance of our interest-bearing investment portfolio of $39.0 million, or 6.2%, year over year, and an increase in the weighted average yield from 13.3% during the year ended September 30, 2023 to 13.9% during the year ended September 30, 2024.\n\nExpenses, net of any non-contractual, unconditional and irrevocable credits to fees from the Adviser, increased $5.1 million, or 11.3%, for the year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to a $2.0 million increase in the net base management fee, a $1.0 million increase in the net incentive fee, and a $0.9 million increase in interest expense.\n\nNet investment income for the year ended September 30, 2024 was $46.1 million, an increase of 12.3%, as compared to the prior year, or $2.11 per share.\n\nThe net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $94.5 million, or $4.34 per share, for the year ended September 30, 2024, compared to $42.7 million, or $2.29 per share, for the year ended September 30, 2023. The current year increase was driven by net investment income of $46.1 million, $42.7 million in net unrealized appreciation, and $6.0 million in net realized gains.\n\n**Subsequent Events:** Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the following significant events occurred:\n\n  * **Portfolio Activity:**\n\n    * In October 2024, our debt investment in Perimeter Solutions Group paid off at par for net cash proceeds of $15.5 million, including a $0.5 million prepayment penalty.\n\n    * In October 2024, our investment in Antenna Research Associates, Inc. was sold, which resulted in a realized gain of approximately $59.3 million and the repayment of our debt investment of $31.3 million at par.\n\n    * In November 2024, we invested an additional $28.9 million in Giving Home Health Care, LLC, an existing portfolio company, through secured first lien debt.\n\n\n\n\n  * **Distributions and Dividends Declared:**\n\n    * In October 2024, our Board of Directors declared the following distributions to common and preferred stockholders:\n\n\n**Record Date** | **Payment Date** | **Distribution per Common Share**  \n---|---|---  \nOctober 22, 2024 | October 31, 2024 | **$** | **0.165**  \nNovember 20, 2024 | November 29, 2024 | 0.165  \nDecember 20, 2024 | December 31, 2024 | 0.165  \n**Total for the Quarter** | **$** | **0.495**  \n  \n**Record Date** | **Payment Date** | **Distribution per Series A Preferred Stock**  \n---|---|---  \nOctober 24, 2024 | November 4, 2024 | $ | 0.130208  \nNovember 27, 2024 | December 4, 2024 | 0.130208  \nDecember 23, 2024 | January 3, 2025 | 0.130208  \n**Total for the Quarter** | **$** | **0.390624**  \n  \n  * In November 2024, our Board of Directors declared the following supplemental distribution to common stockholders:\n\n\n\n\n**Record Date** | **Payment Date** | **Distribution per Common Share**  \n---|---|---  \nDecember 4, 2024 | December 18, 2024 | **$** | **0.40**  \n  \n**Comments from Gladstone Capital's President, Bob Marcotte:** \"We are pleased to report the successful exit of our largest investment position after the end of the quarter at a material gain, a portion of which is reflected in the supplemental distribution recently announced.

The current year increase was driven by net\ninvestment income of $46.1 million, $42.7 million in net unrealized appreciation, and $6.0\nmillion in net realized gains.\nSubsequent Events: Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the following significant events\noccurred:\nPortfolio Activity:\nIn October 2024, our debt investment in Perimeter Solutions Group paid off at\npar for net cash proceeds of $15.5 million, including a $0.5 million prepayment\npenalty.\nIn October 2024, our investment in Antenna Research Associates, Inc. was sold,\nwhich resulted in a realized gain of approximately $59.3 million and the\nrepayment of our debt investment of $31.3 million at par.\nIn November 2024, we invested an additional $28.9 million in Giving Home\nHealth Care, LLC, an existing portfolio company, through secured first lien debt.\nDistributions and Dividends Declared:\nIn October 2024, our Board of Directors declared the following distributions to\ncommon and preferred stockholders:\nDistribution\nper Common\nShare\nRecord Date Payment Date\n$ 0.165\nOctober 22, 2024 October 31, 2024\n0.165\nNovember 20, 2024 November 29, 2024\n0.165\nDecember 20, 2024 December 31, 2024\n$ 0.495\nTotal for the Quarter\nDistribution\nper Series A\nPreferred\nStock\nRecord Date Payment Date\n$ 0.130208\nOctober 24, 2024 November 4, 2024\n0.130208\nNovember 27, 2024 December 4, 2024\n0.130208\nDecember 23, 2024 January 3, 2025\n$ 0.390624\nTotal for the Quarter\nIn November 2024, our Board of Directors declared the following supplemental\ndistribution to common stockholders:\nDistribution\nper Common\nShare\nRecord Date Payment Date\n$ 0.40\nDecember 4, 2024 December 18, 2024\nComments from Gladstone Capital's President, Bob Marcotte: \"We are pleased to report\nthe successful exit of our largest investment position after the end of the quarter at a material\ngain, a portion of which is reflected in the supplemental distribution recently announced.\nWhile the pacing of our direct originations picked up last quarter, the fundings carried over to\nthe current quarter which, combined with the reinvestment of the majority of the equity gain\nproceeds, are expected to enhance our net interest margin and earnings available for cash\ndistributions in FY 2025.\"\nConference Call for Stockholders: The Company will hold its earnings release conference\ncall on Thursday, November 14, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

businesses\nExperienced, long-tenured leadership and investment team\nHigh-quality sourcing and execution model with high degree of selectivity\nDiversified, conservative portfolio with focus on senior secured, first lien loans\nActive portfolio management and risk monitoring\nFocus on shareholder alignment\nPage 4\nGladstone Capital Overview\nBackground:\n Founded in 2001 with the purpose of making loans to lower middle market U.S. businesses, Gladstone Capital’s\ninvestment team is exclusively focused on this segment of the private capital market\n Gladstone Capital is funded through publicly traded common stock (Nasdaq: GLAD) and is leveraged via various\nsenior unsecured note issues and a bank revolving credit facility\n Managed by Gladstone Management Corporation, an SEC registered investment adviser managing $4.0+ billion in\nassets across four publicly traded yield-oriented funds\nInvestment Strategy:\n Target direct originated secured debt investments in growth-oriented companies with revenue visibility and free\ncashflow to support organic deleveraging and where capital structure flexibility and lender support are valued\n Target companies with operating cash flow (EBITDA) of $3-25 million and investments of $8-40 million which are\nbelow the investment threshold of most of the large-scale private capital funds\n Majority of investments are backed by private equity sponsors (~82% of the portfolio at 9/30/24), which provide\ngovernance oversight, strategic sector insight, experience managing leveraged capital structures and access to\nadditional investment capacity to support growth\nDeal Sourcing/Diligence/Risk Management:\n Leverage experienced origination team to source, structure, undertake “equity level” diligence and pro-actively\nmanage investmentsviaongoingboardlevelparticipationto mitigate credit losses\n Highly selective screening process where under 5% of deals reviewed ultimately close and all deals require financial\nmaintenance covenants\n All investments undergo ongoing senior management review, quarterly third-party expert investment valuations in\nsupport of SEC filed financials which are subject to quarterly oversight by Gladstone Capital’s audit committee and\nindependent board members\nPage 5\nAttractive Lower Middle Market Dynamics\nWhy focus on lower middle market (“LMM”) companies\n Greater industry diversity and more consistent flow of growth-oriented investment opportunities\n LMM companies typically sell for lower cash flow multiples, which translates into reduced financial leverage, better asset\ncollateral coverage and ability to structure and control entire debt financing solution\n Smaller investment size attracts less competition from larger private debt funds or commercial banks which supports\nmore attractive investment returns at lower relative leverage levels\n More receptive to equity co-investments, providing an opportunity to selectively participate in anticipated growth and\nequity appreciation\nTrends Enhancing Opportunity for Non-Bank/Private Credit Lenders\n PE Sponsor’s ability to scale LMM platform investments and achieve their targeted equity returns often require the\nfinancing be flexible or include future funding to support the growth needs of the business and a more experienced and\nresponsive lender able to underwrite the long-term equity plan\n The ability to provide simplified “one-stop” financing solutions serves to expedite transaction closing, allows GLAD\nprimary diligence and control of documentation while simplifying the funding of future growth or facility modifications\n Shifting capital market conditions and leverage constraints are expected to reduce regional bank participation in the\nLMM loan market and few large banks have coverage platforms able to originate or manage LMM investments\n Over 90% of private debt funds raised exceed $1B and are managed by multi-billion firms focused on larger borrowers\n(>$25 million EBITDA) with higher minimum investment thresholds consistent with lower management fees and\ninstitutional capital deployment objectives\nLMM is a less competitive segment of the leverage finance market which provides a more\nattractive risk reward profile and matches up well with the investment flexibilities of\nGladstone Capital’s non-bank investment platform\nPage 6\nGladstone Capital 9/30/2024 Quarter Summary\nOriginations/Portfolio Activity:\n New investments totaled $28.5 million during the quarter, comprised of add-on investments in support of existing\nportfolio companies.\n Refinancings and amortization payments were $12.6 million, resulting in net originations of $15.9 million.\nPortfolio Yield /NetInvestmentIncome(NII):\n The Fed’s reduction in short-term rates was late in the quarter, so the weighted average yield was unchanged at 14%\nand with earning assets relatively unchanged, interest income increased 0.8% to $23.4 million.\n Given modest asset turnover, other investment income declined $2.2 million leading total investment income to decline\nby $2.0 million, to $23.7 million.\n Total expenses declined by $0.5 million as net management fees and professional/other fees declined while interest and\nfinancing costs were unchanged on a modest reduction on average line borrowings.\n Net investment income for the quarter declined by $1.4 million, or 12% to $11 million, or $0.50, per share and covered\ncommondistributions.\nPortfolio PerformanceandValuation:\n Our portfolio continues to perform well with generally modest leverage metrics and favorable liquidity, and we ended\nthequarterwith threenon-earningdebtinvestmentsrepresenting 1.9%ofdebtinvestmentsatfairvalue.\n Conservative asset mix with 84% of investments in secured loans, 70% in lower risk 1st lien loans and weighted average\nleverage across core proprietary loan portfolio of ~3.8x.\n Appreciation for the quarter of $21 million was led by the unrealized appreciation of our position in ARA which was\npartially offset by the depreciation of several smaller manufacturing, consumer and service-related businesses.\nPage 7\nGladstone

past several quarters, we have\nabsorbed significant refinancings of larger\nand mature credits while seeding a new\nvintage of growth oriented LMM platform\ninvestments to maintain our AUM and\nportfoliodiversity.\n 1st lien investments declined to 69.7% of the\nportfolio largely driven by recent equity\nappreciation.\n Approximately 93.9% of our loan portfolio is\nsubject to floating rates with minimum SOFR\nfloors.\n We continue to make minority equity co-\ninvestments in approximately half of our new\noriginations to selectively capitalize on the\nmost attractive buyout opportunities.\n6/30/23 9/30/23 12/31/23 3/31/24 6/30/24 9/30/24\n The current portfolio valuation of $796.3\nFirst Lien Debt 74.5% 72.5% 72.9% 71.2% 71.6% 69.7%\nmillion represents ~103.3% of cost
