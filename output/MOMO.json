I am pleased to see that our team has maintained the spirit of innovation and adaptation in a challenging environment,\" commented Yan Tang, Chairman and CEO of Hello Group. \"Momo's cash cow business continued to be productive in a healthy community ecosystem. Regarding new endeavors, while strengthening the localization progress, we are more convinced of the revenue growth opportunities in overseas market.\"\n\n* This press release contains translations of certain Renminbi amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rate solely for the convenience of readers. Unless otherwise noted, all translations from Renminbi to U.S. dollars, in this press release, were made at a rate of RMB7.2672 to US$1.00, the effective noon buying rate for June 28, 2024 as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board.  \n---  \n  \n**Second****Quarter of 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**_Net revenues_**\n\nTotal net revenues were RMB2,691.4 million (US$370.3 million) in the second quarter of 2024, a decrease of 14.2% from RMB3,137.7 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nLive video service revenues were RMB1,303.0 million (US$179.3 million) in the second quarter of 2024, a decrease of 18.0% from RMB1,588.8 million during the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to our proactive operational adjustments to de-emphasis large scale competition events in the Momo app and a soft consumer sentiment in the current macro environment, and to a lesser degree, Tantan pivoting away from the less dating-centric live video service.\n\nValue-added service revenues mainly include virtual gift revenues and membership subscription revenues. Total value-added service revenues were RMB1,345.3 million (US$185.1 million) in the second quarter of 2024, a decrease of 10.3% from RMB1,499.5 million during the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to our product adjustments to improve Momo app's ecosystem as well as the impact of the macro economy on consumer sentiment, and to a lesser extent, the decline in Tantan's paying users which was in turn due to the decrease in its user base, the recent product upgrade as well as adjustments in its membership auto renewal policy. The decrease was partially offset by the revenue growth from the new standalone apps.\n\nMobile marketing revenues were RMB42.0 million (US$5.8 million) in the second quarter of 2024, an increase of 13.5% from RMB37.0 million during the same period of 2023.\n\nNet revenues from the Momo segment decreased from RMB2,816.6 million in the second quarter of 2023 to RMB2,457.2 million (US$338.1 million) in the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to the decrease in net revenues from value-added service and live video service on Momo app. The decrease was partially offset by the revenue growth of the new standalone apps. Net revenues from the Tantan segment decreased from RMB320.7 million in the second quarter of 2023 to RMB233.7 million (US$32.2 million) in the second quarter of 2024, mainly due to the decrease in net revenues from live video service and value-added service.\n\n**_Cost and expenses_**\n\nCost and expenses were RMB2,275.2 million (US$313.1 million) in the second quarter of 2024, a decrease of 9.6% from RMB2,515.5 million in the second quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to: (a) a decrease in revenue sharing with broadcasters related to live video service on Momo app and Tantan app, and a decrease in revenue sharing with virtual gift recipients of virtual gift service on Momo app. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue sharing with virtual gift recipients for new standalone apps; (b) a decrease in salary expenses and share-based compensation expenses, due to our continuous optimization in personnel costs and the newly granted share options which had lower fair value. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing expenses due to more marketing spend in connection with the annual gala event of Momo's live streaming service.\n\nNon-GAAP cost and expenses (note 1) were RMB2,223.8 million (US$306.0 million) in the second quarter of 2024, a decrease of 9.3% from RMB2,451.8 million during the same period of 2023.\n\n**_Income_**** _from operations_**\n\nIncome from operations was RMB425.0 million (US$58.5 million) in the second quarter of 2024, compared to RMB645.1 million during the same period of 2023. Income from operations of the Momo segment was RMB409.4 million (US$56.3 million) in the second quarter of 2024, which decreased from RMB618.8 million in the second quarter of 2023. Income from operations of the Tantan segment was RMB16.4 million (US$2.3 million) in the second quarter of 2024, which decreased from RMB30.2 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP income from operations (note 1) was RMB476.5 million (US$65.6 million) in the second quarter of 2024, compared to RMB708.8 million during the same period of 2023. Non-GAAP income from operations of the Momo segment was RMB456.7 million (US$62.8 million) in the second quarter of 2024, which decreased from RMB680.8 million in the second quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP income from operations of the Tantan segment was RMB20.6 million (US$2.8 million) in the second quarter of 2024, compared to RMB31.9 million in the second quarter of 2023. \n\n**_Income tax expenses_**\n\nIncome tax expenses were RMB102.6 million (US$14.1 million) in the second quarter of 2024, compared to RMB166.0 million in the second quarter of 2023. The decrease in income tax expenses was primarily due to the lower profit in the second quarter of 2024, and to a lesser extent, lower withholding tax rate due to our eligibility for a preferential tax rate since the beginning of the year.\n\n**_Net_**** _income_**\n\nNet income was RMB397.8 million (US$54.7 million) in the second quarter of 2024, compared to RMB567.6 million during the same period of 2023. Net income from the Momo segment was RMB382.8 million (US$52.7 million) in the second quarter of 2024, compared to RMB542.4 million in the same period of 2023. Net income from the Tantan segment was RMB15.8 million (US$2.2 million) in the second quarter of 2024, compared to RMB29.1 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net income (note 1) was RMB449.2 million (US$61.8 million) in the second quarter of 2024, compared to RMB631.3 million during the same period of 2023. Non-GAAP net income from the Momo segment was RMB430.0 million (US$59.2 million) in the second quarter of 2024, which decreased from RMB604.4 million in the second quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP net income of the Tantan segment was RMB20.0 million (US$2.8 million) in the second quarter of 2024, compared to RMB30.8 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\n**_Net_**** _income attributable to Hello Group Inc._**\n\nNet income attributable to Hello Group Inc. was RMB397.8 million (US$54.7 million) in the second quarter of 2024, compared to RMB568.4 million during the same period of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net income (note 1) attributable to Hello Group Inc. was RMB449.2 million (US$61.8 million) in the second quarter of 2024, compared to RMB632.1 million during the same period of 2023.\n\n**_Net_**** _income_**** _per ADS_**\n\nDiluted net income per ADS was RMB2.11 (US$0.29) in the second quarter of 2024, compared to RMB2.82 in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP diluted net income per ADS (note 1) was RMB2.38 (US$0.33) in the second quarter of 2024, compared to RMB3.14 in the second quarter of 2023.\n\n**_Cash and cash flow_**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, short-term deposits, long-term deposits, short-term restricted cash and long-term restricted cash totaled RMB14,316.4 million (US$1,970.0 million), compared to RMB13,478.5 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter of 2024 was RMB475.2 million (US$65.4 million), compared to RMB827.7 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\n**F****irst Half of 2024****Financial Results**\n\nNet revenues for the first half of 2024 were RMB5,251.8 million (US$722.7 million), a decrease of 11.8% from RMB5,956.5 million in the same period of 2023.\n\nNet income attributable to Hello Group Inc. was RMB403.0 million (US$55.5 million) for the first half of 2024, compared to RMB958.7 million during the same period of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to Hello Group Inc. (note 1) was RMB509.1 million (US$70.1 million) for the first half of 2024, compared to RMB1,104.1 million during the same period of 2023.\n\nDiluted net income per ADS was RMB2.10 (US$0.29) during the first half of 2024, compared to RMB4.78 in the same period of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP diluted net income per ADS (note 1) was RMB2.65 (US$0.37) during the first half of 2024, compared to RMB5.49 in the same period of 2023.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was RMB875.4 million (US$120.5 million) during the first half of 2024, compared to RMB1,278.8 million in the same period of 2023.\n\n**Recent Development**\n\n_Share repurchase program_\n\nOn June 7, 2022, Hello Group's board of directors authorized a share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to US$200 million of its shares up to June 6, 2024 (the \"Share Repurchase Program\"). On March 14, 2024, Hello Group's board of directors approved to amend the Share Repurchase Program to (i) extend the term of the Share Repurchase Program up to June 30, 2026, and (ii) upsize the Share Repurchase Program so that the Company is authorized to, from time to time, acquire up to an aggregate of US$286.1 million worth of its shares in the form of ADSs and/or the ordinary shares of the Company in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions, in block trades and/or through other legally permissible means, depending on market conditions and in accordance with applicable rules and regulations.\n\nAs of September 3, the Company has repurchased 30.9 million ADSs for US$174.6 million on the open market under Share Repurchase Program announced on June 7, 2022 and amended on March 14, 2024, at an average purchase price of US$5.63 per ADS.\n\n**Business Outlook**\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, the Company expects total net revenues to be between RMB2.58 billion to RMB2.68 billion, representing a decrease of 15.2% to 11.9% year over year.

Our non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to the GAAP results. In addition, our calculation of the non-GAAP financial measures may be different from the calculation used by other companies, and therefore comparability may be limited.\n\nOur non-GAAP information (including non-GAAP cost and operating expenses, income (loss) from operations, net income (loss), net income attributable to Hello Group Inc., and diluted net income per ADS) is adjusted from the most comparable GAAP results to exclude share-based compensation and such adjustment has no impact on income tax. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that share-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future significant recurring expenses in our results of operations. We compensate for such limitation by providing reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to our U.S. GAAP measures. Please see the reconciliation tables at the end of this earnings release.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nHello Group's management will host an earnings conference call on Tuesday, September 3, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time (8:00 p.m. Beijing / Hong Kong Time on September 3, 2024).\n\nParticipants can register for the conference call by navigating to:\n\n<https://s1.c-conf.com/diamondpass/10041441-w8sbhf.html>.\n\nUpon registration, each participant will receive details for the conference call, including dial-in numbers, conference call passcode and a unique access PIN.

Announces Unaudited Financial Results for the First Quarter of 2024\n\nBEIJING, May 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Hello Group Inc. (NASDAQ: MOMO) (\"Hello Group\" or the \"Company\"), a leading player in mainland China's online social networking space, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter of 2024. \n\n**First****Quarter of 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Net revenues decreased by 9.2% year over year to RMB2,560.4 million (US$354.6 million*) in the first quarter of 2024.\n  * Net income attributable to Hello Group Inc. decreased to RMB5.2 million (US$0.7 million) in the first quarter of 2024, from RMB390.3 million in the same period of 2023.\n  * Non-GAAP net income attributable to Hello Group Inc. (note 1) decreased to RMB59.9 million (US$8.3 million) in the first quarter of 2024, from RMB471.9 million in the same period of 2023, mainly due to the accrual of withholding income tax of RMB448.6 million (US$62.1 million) on historical undistributed earnings generated by our wholly-foreign owned enterprise (\"WFOE\").\n  * Diluted net income per American Depositary Share (\"ADS\") was RMB0.03 (US$0.00) in the first quarter of 2024, compared to RMB1.96 in the same period of 2023.\n  * Non-GAAP diluted net income per ADS (note 1) was RMB0.31 (US$0.04) in the first quarter of 2024, compared to RMB2.36 in the same period of 2023.\n  * Monthly Active Users (\"MAU\") on Tantan app were 13.7 million in March 2024, compared to 19.5 million in March 2023.\n  * For the Momo app total paying users was 7.1 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 7.8 million for the same period last year. Tantan had 1.1 million paying users for the first quarter of 2024 compared to 1.6 million from the year ago period.\n\n\n\n\"We have made steady progress in implementing our strategic priorities for Momo, Tantan, and our new endeavors since the beginning of the year,\" commented Yan Tang, Chairman and CEO of Hello Group. \"Product innovation and our ability to leverage technological advancements have enabled Momo to play an important role in helping users discover new relationships and build meaningful interactions. This has laid a solid foundation for us to maintain user and revenue scale over the long term. I am also glad to see that our overseas team has accelerated the localization process to drive continued growth in the new endeavors. We look forward to delivering high quality social and entertainment services to a much broader user base global wise.\" \n\n* This press release contains translations of certain Renminbi amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rate solely for the convenience of readers. Unless otherwise noted, all translations from Renminbi to U.S. dollars, in this press release, were made at a rate of RMB7.2203 to US$1.00, the effective noon buying rate for March 29, 2024 as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board.  \n---  \n  \n**First Quarter of 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**_Net revenues_**\n\nTotal net revenues were RMB2,560.4 million (US$354.6 million) in the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of 9.2% from RMB2,818.9 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nLive video service revenues were RMB1,238.5 million (US$171.5 million) in the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of 13.3% from RMB1,429.3 million during the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to our proactive operational adjustments to de-emphasise large scale competition events in the Momo app and a soft consumer sentiment in the current macro environment, and to a lesser degree, Tantan pivoting away from the less dating-centric live video service.\n\nValue-added service revenues mainly include virtual gift revenues and membership subscription revenues. Total value-added service revenues were RMB1,294.4 million (US$179.3 million) in the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of 4.9% from RMB1,361.5 million during the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to our product adjustments to improve Momo app's ecosystem as well as the impact of the macro economy on consumer sentiment, and to a lesser extent, the decline in Tantan's paying users. The decrease was partially offset by the rapid revenue growth from the new standalone apps.\n\nMobile marketing revenues were RMB26.6 million (US$3.7 million) in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 26.2% from RMB21.1 million during the same period of 2023.\n\nMobile games revenues were RMB0.4 million (US$0.1 million) in the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of 88.3% from RMB3.7 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nNet revenues from the Momo segment decreased from RMB2,510.1 million in the first quarter of 2023 to RMB2,318.9 million (US$321.2 million) in the first quarter of 2024, primarily due to the decrease in net revenues from value-added service and live video service on Momo app. The decrease was partially offset by the revenue growth of the new standalone apps. Net revenues from the Tantan segment decreased from RMB308.6 million in the first quarter of 2023 to RMB241.5 million (US$33.4 million) in the first quarter of 2024, mainly due to the decrease in net revenues from live video service, and to a lesser extent, the decrease from value-added service.\n\n**_Cost and expenses_**\n\nCost and expenses were RMB2,120.0 million (US$293.6 million) in the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of 12.4% from RMB2,419.1 million in the first quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to: (a) a decrease in revenue sharing with broadcasters related to live video service on Momo app and Tantan app, and a decrease in revenue sharing with virtual gift recipients of virtual gift service on Momo app. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue sharing with virtual gift recipients for new standalone apps; (b) a decrease in salary expenses and share-based compensation expenses, due to our continuous optimization in personnel costs and the newly granted share options which had lower fair value; (c) a decrease in sales and marketing expenses due to less marketing and promotional spend on live video service and our strategy to trim inefficient channel marketing spend.\n\nNon-GAAP cost and expenses (note 1) were RMB2,065.3 million (US$286.0 million) in the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of 11.6% from RMB2,337.4 million during the same period of 2023.\n\n**_Income_**** _from operations_**\n\nIncome from operations was RMB460.3 million (US$63.8 million) in the first quarter of 2024, compared to RMB436.2 million during the same period of 2023. Income from operations of the Momo segment was RMB434.0 million (US$60.1 million) in the first quarter of 2024, which decreased from RMB435.0 million in the first quarter of 2023. Income from operations of the Tantan segment was RMB28.6 million (US$4.0 million) in the first quarter of 2024, which increased from RMB5.2 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP income from operations (note 1) was RMB515.0 million (US$71.3 million) in the first quarter of 2024, compared to RMB517.8 million during the same period of 2023. Non-GAAP income from operations of the Momo segment was RMB488.5 million (US$67.7 million) in the first quarter of 2024, which decreased from RMB507.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP income from operations of the Tantan segment was RMB28.8 million (US$4.0 million) in the first quarter of 2024, compared to RMB14.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. \n\n**_Income tax expenses_**\n\nIncome tax expenses were RMB557.6 million (US$77.2 million) in the first quarter of 2024, compared to RMB122.6 million in the first quarter of 2023. In the first quarter of 2024, we accrued an income tax expenses of RMB109.0 million (US$15.1 million) associated with the profit generated in this quarter. Additionally, we accrued a withholding income tax of RMB448.6 million (US$62.1 million) associated with our WFOE's historical undistributed earnings for the potential remittance of earnings from our WFOE to its offshore parent company in the form of dividend distribution. Because we believe that we might continue to distribute the WFOE's undistributed earnings in the future to fund our demands in overseas business operations, payments of dividends, potential investments, etc, to be prudent, we accrued withholding tax on the total balance of undistributed earnings of our WFOE as of March 31, 2024. From the first quarter of 2024, dividends paid by our wholly foreign-owned subsidiary in the Chinese mainland to its offshore parent company in Hong Kong are qualified for the preferential withholding tax rate of 5% under the Arrangement between the PRC and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income, instead of the normal withholding tax rate of 10%.\n\n**_Net_**** _income_**\n\nNet income was RMB5.2 million (US$0.7 million) in the first quarter of 2024, compared to RMB389.5 million during the same period of 2023. Net loss of the Momo segment was RMB20.8 million (US$2.9 million) in the first quarter of 2024, compared to a net income of RMB389.0 million in the same period of 2023. Net income from the Tantan segment was RMB28.2 million (US$3.9 million) in the first quarter of 2024, compared to RMB4.5 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net income (note 1) was RMB59.9 million (US$8.3 million) in the first quarter of 2024, compared to RMB471.1 million during the same period of 2023. Non-GAAP net income from the Momo segment was RMB33.7 million (US$4.7 million) in the first quarter of 2024, which decreased from RMB461.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP net income of the Tantan segment was RMB28.4 million (US$3.9 million) in the first quarter of 2024, compared to RMB13.7 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\n**_Net_**** _income attributable to Hello Group Inc._**\n\nNet income attributable to Hello Group Inc. was RMB5.2 million (US$0.7 million) in the first quarter of 2024, compared to RMB390.3 million during the same period of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net income (note 1) attributable to Hello Group Inc. was RMB59.9 million (US$8.3 million) in the first quarter of 2024, compared to RMB471.9 million during the same period of 2023.\n\n**_Net_**** _income_**** _per ADS_**\n\nDiluted net income per ADS was RMB0.03 (US$0.00) in the first quarter of 2024, compared to RMB1.96 in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP diluted net income per ADS (note 1) was RMB0.31 (US$0.04) in the first quarter of 2024, compared to RMB2.36 in the first quarter of 2023.\n\n**_Cash and cash flow_**\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, short-term deposits, long-term deposits, short-term restricted cash and long-term restricted cash totaled RMB15,115.8 million (US$2,093.5 million), compared to RMB13,478.5 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2024 was RMB400.2 million (US$55.4 million), compared to RMB451.1 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\n**Recent Development**\n\n_Payment of a special cash dividend_\n\nIn March 2024, Hello Group's board of directors declared a special cash dividend in the amount of US$0.54 per ADS, or US$0.27 per ordinary share.

This forecast reflects the Company's current and preliminary views on the market and operational conditions, which are subject to change.\n\n**Note 1: Non-GAAP measures**\n\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), we, Hello Group, use various non-GAAP financial measures that are adjusted from the most comparable GAAP results to exclude share-based compensation.\n\nReconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to our U.S. GAAP financial measures are shown in tables at the end of this earnings release, which provide more details about the non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial information is provided as additional information to help investors compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis and to enhance investors' overall understanding of the historical and current financial performance of our continuing operations and our prospects for the future. Our non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to the GAAP results. In addition, our calculation of the non-GAAP financial measures may be different from the calculation used by other companies, and therefore comparability may be limited.\n\nOur non-GAAP information (including non-GAAP cost and operating expenses, income (loss) from operations, net income (loss), net income attributable to Hello Group Inc., and diluted net income per ADS) is adjusted from the most comparable GAAP results to exclude share-based compensation. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that share-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future significant recurring expenses in our results of operations. We compensate for such limitation by providing reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to our U.S. GAAP measures. Please see the reconciliation tables at the end of this earnings release.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nHello Group's management will host an earnings conference call on Tuesday, May 28, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time (8:00 p.m. Beijing / Hong Kong Time on May 28, 2024).\n\nParticipants can register for the conference call by navigating to:\n\n<https://s1.c-conf.com/diamondpass/10039014-cp8m51.html>.\n\nUpon registration, each participant will receive details for the conference call, including dial-in numbers, conference call passcode and a unique access PIN.
