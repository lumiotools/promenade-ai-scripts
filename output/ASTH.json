We believe this acquisition continues to solidify Astrana as our nation's leading healthcare delivery platform, enabling us to deliver technology-driven, longitudinal, and patient-centered care to an estimated combined 1.7 million members across the country.\"\n\nJim Brown, CEO of Prospect, said, \"We are excited at the opportunity to partner with Astrana to build a larger, stronger, and more coordinated care delivery network which we expect will benefit our communities by increasing access, quality, value, and efficiency. We believe the strong cultural alignment, cohesive missions, and clear financial and operational synergies between our companies make Astrana the ideal partner for us. We look forward to working together to further our joint mission of delivering high-quality, affordable, and accessible care for all.\"\n\nAstrana plans to make significant investments in Prospect and its infrastructure in order to further enhance access and quality of care for patients in local communities. The partnership between Astrana and Prospect will help ensure that healthcare remains local and personalized for patients across four states.\n\nAdditional details regarding Astrana's planned acquisition of Prospect can be found on the Company's Investor Relations [website](https://ir.astranahealth.com/ \"Opens in a new window\").\n\n**Transaction Details**\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, Astrana plans to acquire the Prospect businesses and assets for a purchase price of $745 million.

For more information, please visit _[www.astranahealth.com](http://www.astranahealth.com)_. \n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements include words such as \"forecast,\" \"guidance,\" \"projects,\" \"estimates,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"may,\" \"plans,\" \"seeks,\" \"should,\" or \"will,\" or the negative of these words or similar words. Forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those discussed in each such statement. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those included within or contemplated by the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, risks arising from the diversion of management's attention from the Company's ongoing business operations, an increase in the amount of costs, fees and expenses and other charges related to the acquisition described in this press release, outcome of any litigation that the Company or Prospect may become subject to relating to such acquisition, the extent of, and the time necessary to obtain, any regulatory approvals required for completion of the acquisition, risks of disruption to the Company's business as a result of the public announcement of the acquisition, the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the agreements relating to the acquisition, an inability to complete the acquisition in a timely manner or at all, including due to a failure of any condition to the closing of the acquisition to be satisfied or waived by the applicable party, the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of any of the agreements to the acquisition, a decline in the market price for the Company's common stock if the acquisition is not completed, risks that the acquisition disrupts current plans and operations of the Company or Prospect and potential difficulties in Prospect's employee retention as a result of the acquisition, the Company's ability to successfully obtain funding of, and pay the interest and principal on, the Bridge Facility provided for in the Commitment Letter, and the ability to implement business plans, forecasts and other expectations after the completion of the acquisition, realize the intended benefits of the acquisition, and identify and realize additional opportunities following the acquisition, as well as the other risks and uncertainties identified in filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as may be amended or supplemented by additional risk factors set forth in subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company does not undertake any responsibility to update any of these factors or to announce publicly any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained in this or any other document, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required by any applicable securities laws. \n\n**Pro Forma Measures**\n\nThis press release includes pro forma information that gives effect to the consummation of the acquisition. The combined company forward-looking financial data are for illustrative purposes only and should not be relied on as necessarily being indicative of future results. The assumptions and estimates underlying the combined company forward-looking financial data are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the prospective financial information, including those under \"Forward Looking Statements\" above. Combined company forward-looking financial data is inherently uncertain due to a number of factors outside of the Company's or Prospect's control. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the prospective results are indicative of future performance of the combined company after completing the proposed acquisition or that actual results will not differ materially from those presented in the combined company forward-looking financial data. Inclusion of combined company forward-looking financial data in this press release should not be regarded as a representation by any person that the results contained in the prospective financial information will be achieved. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the pro forma combined company financial information.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release contains the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted EBITDA, of which the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") is net income. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP, and may be calculated differently from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure of its operations, for financial and operational decision-making, and as a supplemental means of evaluating period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, excluding income or loss from equity method investments, non-recurring and non-cash transactions, and stock-based compensation.\n\nThe Company believes the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure provides investors with relevant and useful information, as it allows investors to evaluate the operating performance of the business activities without having to account for differences recognized because of non-core or non-recurring financial information. When GAAP financial measures are viewed in conjunction with non-GAAP financial measures, investors are provided with a more meaningful understanding of the Company's ongoing operating performance. In addition, this non-GAAP financial measure is among those indicators the Company uses as a basis for evaluating operational performance, allocating resources, and planning and forecasting future periods. Non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes. The Company has not provided a quantitative reconciliation of the projected adjusted EBITDA in 2024 for Prospect to the most comparable GAAP measure, net income, on a forward-looking basis within this press release because the Company is unable, without unreasonable efforts, to provide reconciling information with respect to certain line items that cannot be calculated. These items, which could materially affect the computation of forward-looking GAAP net income, are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, some of which are outside of the Company's control.\n\n**FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT:**\n\nInvestor Relations\n\n(626) 943-6491\n\nAsher Dewhurst, ICR Westwicke\n\n_investors@astranahealth.com_\n\nView original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/astrana-health-announces-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-certain-businesses-and-assets-of-prospect-health-system-302299925.html>\n\nSOURCE Astrana Health, Inc.\n\nReleased November 8, 2024\n\n  * [emailEmail Alerts](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [location_cityCompany Profile](/company-information)\n  * [contact_pageContacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [rss_feedRSS News Feed](/rss-news-feed)\n  * [account_treeSitemap](/sitemap)\n\n\n"

(\"AHM\"), formerly known as Network Medical Management, Inc., who were AHM shareholders at the time of closing of the merger, as they have yet to submit properly completed letters of transmittal to Astrana in order to receive their pro rata portion of Astrana's common stock and warrants as contemplated under that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 21, 2016, among Astrana, AHM, Apollo Acquisition Corp. (\"Merger Subsidiary\") and Kenneth Sim, M.D., as amended, pursuant to which Merger Subsidiary merged with and into AHM, with AHM as the surviving corporation. Pending such receipt, such former AHM shareholders have the right to receive, without interest, their pro rata share of dividends or distributions with a record date after the effectiveness of the merger. The Company's consolidated financial statements have treated such shares of common stock as outstanding, given the receipt of the letter of transmittal is considered perfunctory and Astrana is legally obligated to issue these shares in connection with the merger.\n\nShares of Astrana's common stock owned by Allied Physicians of California, a Professional Medical Corporation (\"APC\"), a VIE of the Company, are legally issued and outstanding but excluded from shares of common stock outstanding in the Company's consolidated financial statements, as such shares are treated as treasury shares for accounting purposes. Such shares, therefore, are not included in the number of shares of common stock outstanding used to calculate the Company's earnings per share.\n\n**About Astrana Health, Inc.**\n\nAstrana is a leading physician-centric, technology-powered, risk-bearing healthcare management company. Leveraging its proprietary population health management and healthcare delivery platform, Astrana operates an integrated, value-based healthcare model, which aims to empower the providers in its network to deliver the highest quality of care to its patients in a cost-effective manner.

These measures are not in accordance with, or alternatives to GAAP, and may be calculated differently from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure of our operations, for financial and operational decision-making, and as a supplemental means of evaluating period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, excluding income or loss from equity method investments, non-recurring and non-cash transactions, stock-based compensation, and APC excluded assets costs. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA over total revenue.\n\nThe Company believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with relevant and useful information, as it allows investors to evaluate the operating performance of the business activities without having to account for differences recognized because of non-core or non-recurring financial information. When GAAP financial measures are viewed in conjunction with non-GAAP financial measures, investors are provided with a more meaningful understanding of the Company's ongoing operating performance. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are among those indicators the Company uses as a basis for evaluating operational performance, allocating resources, and planning and forecasting future periods. Non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. Other companies may calculate both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting the usefulness of these measures for comparative purposes. To the extent this release contains historical or future non-GAAP financial measures, the Company has provided corresponding GAAP financial measures for comparative purposes. The reconciliation between certain GAAP and non-GAAP measures is provided above.\n\nView original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/astrana-health-inc-reports-third-quarter-2024-results-302299386.html>\n\nSOURCE Astrana Health, Inc.\n\nReleased November 7, 2024\n\n  * [emailEmail Alerts](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [location_cityCompany Profile](/company-information)\n  * [contact_pageContacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [rss_feedRSS News Feed](/rss-news-feed)\n  * [account_treeSitemap](/sitemap)\n\n\n"

(\"Astrana,\" and together with its subsidiaries and affiliated entities, the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: ASTH), a leading provider-centric, technology-powered healthcare company enabling providers to deliver accessible, high-quality, and high-value care to all, today announced its consolidated financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n[ ![Astrana Health \\(PRNewsfoto/Apollo Medical Holdings, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1576087/Astrana_Health_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1576087/Astrana_Health_Logo.html \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\"We believe our strong second quarter results and entry into new states reflect the progress, scale, and momentum we continue to build at Astrana as we drive towards our mission to empower entrepreneurial providers and deliver great healthcare to local communities across the country. Strong revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth in the quarter were driven by continued organic growth in our Care Partners segment, the successful integration of the Community Family Care acquisition, and continued success in managing total cost of care for our one million members in value-based, risk-bearing arrangements. Our entry into Arizona and Hawai'i, partnerships with Anthem Blue Cross and Elation Health, and our agreement to acquire Collaborative Health Systems are anticipated to continue driving strong, sustainable, and profitable growth for the Astrana platform. We are excited to continue proving that value-based care can be done successfully in communities across the country,\" said President and CEO of Astrana Health, Brandon K. Sim.\n\n**Financial Highlights for Second Quarter Ended June 30, 2024:**\n\n_All comparisons are to the quarter ended June 30, 2023 unless otherwise stated._\n\n  * Total revenue of $486.3 million, up 40% from $348.2 million\n  * Care Partners revenue of $463.3 million, up 44% from $321.8 million\n  * Net income attributable to Astrana of $19.2 million, up 46% from $13.2 million\n  * Earnings per share - diluted (\"EPS - diluted\") of $0.40, up 43% from $0.28 per share\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $47.9 million, up 34% from $35.8 million\n\n\n\n**Financial Highlights for Six Months Ended June 30, 2024:**\n\n_All comparisons are to the six months ended June 30, 2023 unless otherwise stated._\n\n  * Total revenue of $890.6 million, up 30% from $685.5 million\n  * Care Partners revenue of $845.6 million, up 33% from $636.4 million\n  * Net income attributable to Astrana of $34.0 million, up 29% from $26.3 million\n  * EPS - diluted of $0.71, up 27% from $0.56 per share\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $90.2 million, up 38% from $65.6 million\n\n\n\n**Recent Operating Highlights**\n\n  * On May 24, 2024, the Company entered the state of Arizona through its Care Partners segment, partnering with an anchor primary care physician group with over 45 primary care providers serving around 50,000 patients across Medicare, Medicaid, and Commercial lines of business. The group is expected to be onboarded onto Astrana's Care Enablement platform by the end of 2024.\n  * On July 15, 2024, the Company announced a new partnership with Anthem Blue Cross to build and operate primary care clinics aimed at improving access to high-quality healthcare for their shared members.\n  * On July 17, 2024, the Company announced its strategic partnership with Elation Health, a technology company whose electronic health record platform is used nationwide by more than 32,000 clinicians. Together, the two organizations will aim to empower primary care providers via value-based arrangements, leveraging both Astrana and Elation's technology platform and solutions. As part of the partnership, Astrana entered the state of Hawai'i, partnering with a provider organization of over 100 primary care providers serving just under 20,000 primarily Medicare patients. Astrana will serve as the group's exclusive care enablement provider, with providers anticipated to fully integrate onto Astrana's Care Enablement platform by the end of the third quarter of 2024.\n  * On July 24, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Collaborative Health Systems (\"CHS\"), a value-based care enablement organization serving around 2,500 primary care providers and more than 100,000 beneficiaries and a company of Centene Corporation, a leading healthcare enterprise focused on transforming the health of the communities it serves. The acquisition is intended to facilitate the expansion of both Astrana's and CHS' payer-agnostic care delivery capabilities, which serve members across all lines of business, and further empower CHS' providers in the delivery of care to the communities it serves. Astrana and Centene also share a mutual commitment to providing high-quality and coordinated care to members and will continue to work together to expand the scope of their existing value-based partnerships in order to advance that joint mission. The acquisition is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval.\n\n\n\n**Three Months Ended June 30, 2024**  \n---  \n_(in thousands)_ |  **CarePartners** |  **CareDelivery** |  **CareEnablement** |  **Other** |  **IntersegmentElimination** |  **CorporateCosts** |  **ConsolidatedTotal**  \nTotal revenues |  $ |  463,277 |  $ |  34,857 |  $ |  36,172 |  — |  $ |  (48,041) |  — |  $ |  486,265  \n% change vs. prior year quarter |  _44_ |  _%_ |  _32_ |  _%_ |  _3_ |  _%_  \nCost of services |  379,413 |  26,252 |  19,939 |  — |  (12,799) |  — |  412,805  \nGeneral and administrative(1) |  43,541 |  6,780 |  9,315 |  — |  (35,247) |  19,005 |  43,394  \nTotal expenses |  422,954 |  33,032 |  29,254 |  — |  (48,046) |  19,005 |  456,199  \nIncome (loss) from operations |  $ |  40,323 |  $ |  1,825 |  $ |  6,918 |  $ |  — |  $ |  5 |  (2) |  $ |  (19,005) |  $ |  30,066  \n% change vs. prior year quarter |  _45_ |  _%_ |  _221_ |  _%_ |  _(9)_ |  %  \n  \n(1) Balance includes general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization.  \n---  \n(2) Income from operations for the intersegment elimination represents rental income from segments renting from other segments.

The Company consolidates subsidiaries in which it holds, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights, and variable interest entities (\"VIEs\") in which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Noncontrolling interests represent third party equity ownership interests in the Company's consolidated entities (including certain VIEs). The amount of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is disclosed in the Company's consolidated statements of income.\n\n**Note About Stockholders** '**Equity, Certain Treasury Stock and Earnings Per Share**\n\nAs of the date of this press release, 41,048 holdback shares have not been issued to certain former shareholders of the Company's subsidiary, Astrana Health Management, Inc. (\"AHM\"), formerly known as Network Medical Management, Inc., who were AHM shareholders at the time of closing of the merger, as they have yet to submit properly completed letters of transmittal to Astrana in order to receive their pro rata portion of Astrana's common stock as contemplated under that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 21, 2016, among Astrana, AHM, Apollo Acquisition Corp. (\"Merger Subsidiary\") and Kenneth Sim, M.D., as amended, pursuant to which Merger Subsidiary merged with and into AHM, with AHM as the surviving corporation. Pending such receipt, such former AHM shareholders have the right to receive, without interest, their pro rata share of dividends or distributions with a record date after the effectiveness of the merger. The Company's consolidated financial statements have treated such shares of common stock as outstanding, given the receipt of the letter of transmittal is considered perfunctory and Astrana is legally obligated to issue these shares in connection with the merger.\n\nShares of Astrana's common stock owned by Allied Physicians of California, a Professional Medical Corporation (\"APC\"), a VIE of the Company, are legally issued and outstanding but excluded from shares of common stock outstanding in the Company's consolidated financial statements, as such shares are treated as treasury shares for accounting purposes. Such shares, therefore, are not included in the number of shares of common stock outstanding used to calculate the Company's earnings per share.\n\n**About Astrana Health, Inc.**\n\nAstrana is a leading provider-centric, technology-powered healthcare company enabling providers to deliver accessible, high-quality, and high-value care to all. Leveraging its proprietary end-to-end technology solutions, Astrana operates an integrated healthcare delivery platform that enables providers to successfully participate in value-based care arrangements, thus empowering them to deliver high quality care to patients in a cost-effective manner.\n\nHeadquartered in Alhambra, California, Astrana serves over 10,000 providers and approximately one million patients in value-based care arrangements. Its subsidiaries and affiliates include management services organizations (MSOs), a network of risk-bearing organizations (RBOs) that encompasses independent practice associations (IPAs), accountable care organizations (ACOs), and state-specific entities such as Restricted Knox-Keene licensed health plans in California, and care delivery entities across primary, multi-specialty, and ancillary care.

These measures are not in accordance with, or alternatives to, GAAP, and may be calculated differently from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure of our operations, for financial and operational decision-making, and as a supplemental means of evaluating period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, excluding income or loss from equity method investments, non-recurring and non-cash transactions, stock-based compensation, and APC excluded assets costs. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA over total revenue.\n\nThe Company believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with relevant and useful information, as it allows investors to evaluate the operating performance of the business activities without having to account for differences recognized because of non-core or non-recurring financial information. When GAAP financial measures are viewed in conjunction with non-GAAP financial measures, investors are provided with a more meaningful understanding of the Company's ongoing operating performance. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are among those indicators the Company uses as a basis for evaluating operational performance, allocating resources, and planning and forecasting future periods. Non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. Other companies may calculate both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting the usefulness of these measures for comparative purposes. To the extent this release contains historical or future non-GAAP financial measures, the Company has provided corresponding GAAP financial measures for comparative purposes. The reconciliation between certain GAAP and non-GAAP measures is provided above.\n\nView original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/astrana-health-inc-reports-second-quarter-2024-results-302217068.html>\n\nSOURCE Astrana Health, Inc.\n\nReleased August 7, 2024\n\n  * [emailEmail Alerts](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [location_cityCompany Profile](/company-information)\n  * [contact_pageContacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [rss_feedRSS News Feed](/rss-news-feed)\n  * [account_treeSitemap](/sitemap)\n\n\n"

(together with its subsidiaries and affiliated entities, \"Astrana\") (NASDAQ: ASTH), a leading provider-centric, technology-powered healthcare company enabling providers to deliver accessible, high-quality, and high-value care to all, today announced a strategic partnership with _[Elation Health](https://www.elationhealth.com/ \"Opens in a new window\")_ , the clinical-first technology company powering innovation in primary care with more than 32,000 clinicians caring for over 15 million patients using its electronic health record (\"EHR\") platform.\n\n[ ![Astrana Health \\(PRNewsfoto/Apollo Medical Holdings, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1576087/Astrana_Health_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1576087/Astrana_Health_Logo.html \"Opens in a new window\")\n\nAstrana and Elation will partner to empower primary care providers in value-based care. In partnership, the organizations plan to scale risk-bearing entities, including accountable care organizations and clinically integrated networks, anchored by existing and future affiliate providers. Together, the organizations will support independent physicians with the tools to deliver coordinated, high-quality care and to successfully participate in value-based care arrangements. Specifically, for providers in these risk-bearing entities, Elation will provide its award-winning EHR platform, practice transformation, and billing technology. Meanwhile, as the exclusive care enablement partner for these risk-bearing entities, Astrana will deploy its value-based care platform and enablement solutions, including value-based contracting and credentialing, AI-driven population health analytics, its NCQA®-certified HEDIS gaps in care engine, care management and disease management platform, and other administrative services, such as billing, coding, and call center solutions.\n\nTo demonstrate its commitment to this innovative new venture, Astrana has agreed to provide its Care Enablement platform to support an existing provider organization in Hawai'i as a first example of a model that closely integrates Elation's EHR technology with Astrana's value-based care infrastructure and care management capabilities. Jointly, the two organizations will work with a group of over 100 primary care providers serving over 20,000 primarily Medicare patients in the Hawai'i market and support the group as it continues to grow while investing in high-quality, high-value, accessible primary and multi-specialty care. Astrana will serve as the group's exclusive care enablement provider, with providers anticipated to onboard into its Care Enablement platform by the end of Q3 2024.\n\n\"We look forward to a highly collaborative partnership with Astrana to support our current and future provider partners by leveraging their value-based care and enablement expertise to empower the entrepreneurial provider, enhance member experience, improve outcomes, and lower costs,\" said Kyna Fong, co-founder and CEO of Elation Health. \"Further, we are excited to be working together with Astrana in supporting Hawai'i physicians who desire to remain independent while caring for patients across all reimbursement models, and expanding the model to other regions.\"\n\n\"We strongly believe that success in value-based care requires an integrated approach, composed of an EHR that is loved by primary care providers with analytics and insights delivered in the provider's workflow, and care models with care management capabilities that support a patient's whole health. In conjunction, deep integration of value-based care infrastructure with the tools that providers use on a daily basis will be key in our pursuit of the quadruple aim. We believe that our partnership with Elation, a clinician-forward company with a demonstrated track record of successfully empowering local independent primary care practices, creates this innovative, integrated approach to care delivery,\" added Brandon Sim, President and CEO of Astrana. \"We look forward to collaborating with Elation in bringing their EHR and our Care Enablement platform to providers across the country with the joint goal of supporting the delivery of high-quality, high-value healthcare for all.\"\n\n**About Astrana Health** Astrana is a leading provider-centric, technology-powered healthcare company enabling providers to deliver accessible, high-quality, and high-value care to all.

The Company consolidates subsidiaries in which it holds, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights, and variable interest entities (\"VIEs\") in which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Noncontrolling interests represent third party equity ownership interests in the Company's consolidated entities (including certain VIEs). The amount of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is disclosed in the Company's consolidated statements of income.\n\n**Note About Stockholders** '**Equity, Certain Treasury Stock and Earnings Per Share**\n\nAs of the date of this press release, 41,048 holdback shares have not been issued to certain former shareholders of the Company's subsidiary, Astrana Health Management, Inc. (\"AHM\"), formerly known as Network Medical Management, Inc., who were AHM shareholders at the time of closing of the merger, as they have yet to submit properly completed letters of transmittal to Astrana in order to receive their pro rata portion of Astrana's common stock and warrants as contemplated under that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 21, 2016, among Astrana, AHM, Apollo Acquisition Corp. (\"Merger Subsidiary\") and Kenneth Sim, M.D., as amended, pursuant to which Merger Subsidiary merged with and into AHM, with AHM as the surviving corporation. Pending such receipt, such former AHM shareholders have the right to receive, without interest, their pro rata share of dividends or distributions with a record date after the effectiveness of the merger. The Company's consolidated financial statements have treated such shares of common stock as outstanding, given the receipt of the letter of transmittal is considered perfunctory and Astrana is legally obligated to issue these shares in connection with the merger.\n\nShares of Astrana's common stock owned by Allied Physicians of California, a Professional Medical Corporation (\"APC\"), a VIE of the Company, are legally issued and outstanding but excluded from shares of common stock outstanding in the Company's consolidated financial statements, as such shares are treated as treasury shares for accounting purposes. Such shares, therefore, are not included in the number of shares of common stock outstanding used to calculate the Company's earnings per share.\n\n**About Astrana Health, Inc.**\n\nAstrana is a leading physician-centric, technology-powered, risk-bearing healthcare management company. Leveraging its proprietary population health management and healthcare delivery platform, Astrana operates an integrated, value-based healthcare model, which aims to empower the providers in its network to deliver the highest quality of care to its patients in a cost-effective manner. Together with our affiliated physician groups and consolidated entities, we provide coordinated outcomes-based medical care in a cost-effective manner.\n\nHeadquartered in Alhambra, California, Astrana serves over 12,000 providers and approximately 1.1 million patients in value-based care arrangements. Its subsidiaries and affiliates include management services organizations (MSOs), a network of risk-bearing organizations (\"RBOs\") that encompasses independent practice associations (\"IPAs\"), accountable care organizations (\"ACOs\"), and state-specific entities such as Restricted Knox-Keene licensed health plans in California, and care delivery entities across primary, multi-specialty, and ancillary care.

These measures are not in accordance with, or alternatives to GAAP, and may be calculated differently from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure of our operations, for financial and operational decision-making, and as a supplemental means of evaluating period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, excluding income or loss from equity method investments, non-recurring and non-cash transactions, stock-based compensation, and APC excluded assets costs. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA over total revenue.\n\nThe Company believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with relevant and useful information, as it allows investors to evaluate the operating performance of the business activities without having to account for differences recognized because of non-core or non-recurring financial information. When GAAP financial measures are viewed in conjunction with non-GAAP financial measures, investors are provided with a more meaningful understanding of the Company's ongoing operating performance. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are among those indicators the Company uses as a basis for evaluating operational performance, allocating resources, and planning and forecasting future periods. Non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. Other companies may calculate both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting the usefulness of these measures for comparative purposes. To the extent this release contains historical or future non-GAAP financial measures, the Company has provided corresponding GAAP financial measures for comparative purposes. The reconciliation between certain GAAP and non-GAAP measures is provided above.\n\nView original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/astrana-health-inc-reports-third-quarter-2024-results-302299386.html>\n\nSOURCE Astrana Health, Inc.\n\nReleased November 7, 2024\n\n  * [emailEmail Alerts](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [location_cityCompany Profile](/company-information)\n  * [contact_pageContacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [rss_feedRSS News Feed](/rss-news-feed)\n  * [account_treeSitemap](/sitemap)\n\n\n"

The\nCompany consolidates subsidiaries in which it holds, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of\nthe voting rights, and variable interest entities (\"VIEs\") in which the Company is the primary\nbeneficiary. Noncontrolling interests represent third party equity ownership interests in the\nCompany's consolidated entities (including certain VIEs). The amount of net income\nattributable to noncontrolling interests is disclosed in the Company's consolidated\nstatements of income.\nNote About Stockholders' Equity, Certain Treasury Stock and Earnings Per Share\nAs of the date of this press release, 41,048 holdback shares have not been issued to certain\nformer shareholders of the Company's subsidiary, Astrana Health Management, Inc.\n(\"AHM\"), formerly known as Network Medical Management, Inc., who were AHM\nshareholders at the time of closing of the merger, as they have yet to submit properly\ncompleted letters of transmittal to Astrana in order to receive their pro rata portion of\nAstrana's common stock and warrants as contemplated under that certain Agreement and\nPlan of Merger, dated December 21, 2016, among Astrana, AHM, Apollo Acquisition Corp.\n(\"Merger Subsidiary\") and Kenneth Sim, M.D., as amended, pursuant to which Merger\nSubsidiary merged with and into AHM, with AHM as the surviving corporation. Pending such\nreceipt, such former AHM shareholders have the right to receive, without interest, their pro\nrata share of dividends or distributions with a record date after the effectiveness of the\nmerger. The Company's consolidated financial statements have treated such shares of\ncommon stock as outstanding, given the receipt of the letter of transmittal is considered\nperfunctory and Astrana is legally obligated to issue these shares in connection with the\nmerger.\nShares of Astrana's common stock owned by Allied Physicians of California, a Professional\nMedical Corporation (\"APC\"), a VIE of the Company, are legally issued and outstanding but\nexcluded from shares of common stock outstanding in the Company's consolidated financial\nstatements, as such shares are treated as treasury shares for accounting purposes. Such\nshares, therefore, are not included in the number of shares of common stock outstanding\nused to calculate the Company's earnings per share.\nAbout Astrana Health, Inc.\nAstrana is a leading physician-centric, technology-powered, risk-bearing healthcare\nmanagement company. Leveraging its proprietary population health management and\nhealthcare delivery platform, Astrana operates an integrated, value-based healthcare model,\nwhich aims to empower the providers in its network to deliver the highest quality of care to\nits patients in a cost-effective manner.

These measures\nare not in accordance with, or alternatives to GAAP, and may be calculated differently from\nsimilar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Company uses\nAdjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure of our operations, for financial\nand operational decision-making, and as a supplemental means of evaluating period-to-\nperiod comparisons on a consistent basis. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as earnings before\ninterest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, excluding income or loss from equity method\ninvestments, non-recurring and non-cash transactions, stock-based compensation, and APC\nexcluded assets costs. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA\nover total revenue.\nThe Company believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides\ninvestors with relevant and useful information, as it allows investors to evaluate the operating\nperformance of the business activities without having to account for differences recognized\nbecause of non-core or non-recurring financial information. When GAAP financial measures\nare viewed in conjunction with non-GAAP financial measures, investors are provided with a\nmore meaningful understanding of the Company's ongoing operating performance. In\naddition, these non-GAAP financial measures are among those indicators the Company\nuses as a basis for evaluating operational performance, allocating resources, and planning\nand forecasting future periods. Non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be\nconsidered in isolation, or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. Other companies\nmay calculate both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting the usefulness of\nthese measures for comparative purposes. To the extent this release contains historical or\nfuture non-GAAP financial measures, the Company has provided corresponding GAAP\nfinancial measures for comparative purposes. The reconciliation between certain GAAP and\nnon-GAAP measures is provided above.\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-\nreleases/astrana-health-inc-reports-third-quarter-2024-results-302299386.html\nSOURCE Astrana Health, Inc."
