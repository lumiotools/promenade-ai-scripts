          "content": "Travelzoo\n590 Madison Avenue\n35th Floor\nNew York, NY 10022\nInvestor Relations:\nir@travelzoo.com\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nTravelzoo Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results\nNEW YORK, October 23, 2024 — Travelzoo® (NASDAQ: TZOO):\n• Revenue of $20.1 million, down 2% year-over-year\n• Consolidated operating profit of $4.0 million\n• Non-GAAP consolidated operating profit of $4.9 million\n• Cash flow from operations of $5.3 million\n• Earnings per share (EPS) of $0.26\nTravelzoo, the club for travel enthusiasts, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. Consolidated revenue was $20.1 million, down 2% year-over-year. In constant\ncurrencies, revenue was $20.0 million. Travelzoo's reported revenue consists of advertising revenues\nand commissions, derived from and generated in connection with purchases made by Travelzoo\nmembers, and membership fees.\nNet income attributable to Travelzoo was $3.2 million for Q3 2024, or $0.26 per share, compared with\n$0.16 in the prior-year period. Net income attributable to Travelzoo from continuing operations was $3.2\nmillion for Q3 2024, or $0.26 per share, compared with $0.16 in the prior-year period.\n1/10\nNon-GAAP operating profit was $4.9 million. Non-GAAP operating profit excludes amortization of\nintangibles ($95,000), stock option expenses ($0.5 million) and severance-related expenses ($0.3\nmillion). Please refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the tabular reconciliation below.\n“We will continue to leverage Travelzoo's global reach, trusted brand, and strong relationships with top\ntravel suppliers to negotiate more Club Offers for members,” said Holger Bartel, Travelzoo's Global\nCEO. “Travelzoo members are affluent, active, and open to new experiences. We inspire members to\ntravel to places they never imagined they could. Travelzoo is the must-have membership for those who\nlove to travel as much as we do.\"\nCash Position\nAs of September 30, 2024, consolidated cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $12.1 million.\nNet cash provided by operations was $5.3 million.\nTravelzoo North America\nNorth America business segment revenue decreased 4% year-over-year to $12.8 million. Operating\nprofit for Q3 2024 was $3.2 million, or 25% of revenue, compared to operating profit of $3.0 million in\nthe prior-year period.\nTravelzoo Europe\nEurope business segment revenue increased 1% year-over-year to $6.1 million. In constant currencies,\nEurope business segment revenue was $5.9 million. Operating profit for Q3 2024 was $1.0 million, or\n17% of revenue, compared to operating profit of $267,000 in the prior-year period.\nJack’s Flight Club\nJack’s Flight Club is a membership subscription service in which Travelzoo has a 60% ownership\ninterest. Revenue from unaffiliated customers increased 11% year-over-year to $1.2 million. The\nnumber of premium subscribers increased 14% year-over-year. Jack’s Flight Club’s revenue from\nsubscriptions is recognized ratably over the subscription period (quarterly, semi-annually, annually).\nNon-GAAP operating profit for Q3 2024 was $85,000. Non-GAAP operating profit excludes amortization\n2/10\nof intangibles ($58,000) related to the acquisition of Travelzoo’s ownership interest in Jack’s Flight Club\nin 2020.\nNew Initiatives\nNew Initiatives business segment revenue, which includes Licensing and Travelzoo META, was\n$33,000. Operating loss for Q3 2024 was $160,000.\nIn June 2020, Travelzoo entered into a royalty-bearing licensing agreement with a local licensee in\nJapan for the exclusive use of Travelzoo’s brand, business model, and members in Japan. In August of\n2020, Travelzoo entered into a royalty-bearing licensing agreement with a local licensee in Australia for\nthe exclusive use of Travelzoo’s brand, business models, and members in Australia, New Zealand, and\nSingapore. Under these arrangements, Travelzoo’s existing members in Australia, Japan, New\nZealand, and Singapore will continue to be owned by Travelzoo as the licensor. Travelzoo recorded\n$7,000 in licensing revenue from the licensee in Japan in Q3 2024. Travelzoo recorded $10,000 in\nlicensing revenue from the licensee in Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore in Q3 2024. Licensing\nrevenue is expected to increase going forward.\nMembers and Subscribers\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had 30.1 million members and subscribers worldwide. In North America,\nTravelzoo had 15.8 million unduplicated members as of September 30, 2024. In Europe, Travelzoo had\n9.1 million unduplicated members as of September 30, 2024. Jack’s Flight Club had 2.1 million\nsubscribers, including premium subscribers, as of September 30, 2024. Comparisons to prior periods\nare no longer meaningful due to strategic developments of the Travelzoo membership and Jack’s Flight\nClub premium subscriber acquisition. For Travelzoo, the average activity of members is increasing. For\nJack’s Flight Club, the premium subscribers are increasing.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn March 2020, Travelzoo decided to exit its Asia Pacific business and operate it as a licensing\nbusiness going forward. Consequently, the Asia Pacific business has been classified as discontinued\noperations.\n3/10\nIncome Taxes\nA provision of $1.1 million for income taxes was recorded for Q3 2024, compared to an income tax\nexpense of $1.0 million in the prior-year period. Travelzoo intends to utilize available net operating\nlosses (NOLs) to largely offset its actual tax liability for Q3 2024.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring Q3 2024, the Company repurchased 552,679 shares of its outstanding common stock.\nLooking Ahead\nFor Q4 2024, we expect growth in revenue year-over-year, albeit at a smaller pace than in 2023.\nHowever, there could be unexpected fluctuations. We also expect for Q4 2024 higher profitability year-\nover-year and quarter-over-quarter. For 2025, we expect substantial growth in revenue as a result of\nadditional revenue from membership fees.\nIn December 2023, we announced the introduction of a membership fee for Travelzoo beginning\nJanuary 1, 2024. We recognize membership fee revenue ratably over the subscription period. Legacy\nTravelzoo members as of December 31, 2023, which represent more than 95% of members, are\nexempt from the fee during 2024. Therefore, we do not anticipate membership fee revenue from these\nmembers before 2025.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nManagement calculates non-GAAP operating income when evaluating the financial performance of the\nbusiness. Travelzoo’s calculation of non-GAAP operating income, also called “non-GAAP operating\nprofit” in this press release and today’s earnings conference call, excludes the following items:\namortization of intangibles, stock option expenses and severance-related expenses. This press release\nincludes a table which reconciles GAAP operating income to the calculation of non-GAAP operating\nincome. Non-GAAP operating income is not required by, or presented in accordance with, generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). This information should be\nconsidered as supplemental in nature and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for\nthe financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures may not be the same as similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n4/10\nConference Call\nTravelzoo will host a conference call to discuss third quarter 2024 results today at 11:00 a.m. ET.\nPlease visit http://ir.travelzoo.com/events-presentations to\n• download the management presentation (PDF format) to be discussed in the conference call\n• access the webcast\nAbout Travelzoo\nWe, Travelzoo®, are the club for travel enthusiasts.

Consolidated revenue was $20.1 million, down 2% year-over-year. In constant\ncurrencies, revenue was $20.0 million. Travelzoo's reported revenue consists of advertising revenues\nand commissions, derived from and generated in connection with purchases made by Travelzoo\nmembers, and membership fees.\nNet income attributable to Travelzoo was $3.2 million for Q3 2024, or $0.26 per share, compared with\n$0.16 in the prior-year period. Net income attributable to Travelzoo from continuing operations was $3.2\nmillion for Q3 2024, or $0.26 per share, compared with $0.16 in the prior-year period.\n1/10\nNon-GAAP operating profit was $4.9 million. Non-GAAP operating profit excludes amortization of\nintangibles ($95,000), stock option expenses ($0.5 million) and severance-related expenses ($0.3\nmillion). Please refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the tabular reconciliation below.\n“We will continue to leverage Travelzoo's global reach, trusted brand, and strong relationships with top\ntravel suppliers to negotiate more Club Offers for members,” said Holger Bartel, Travelzoo's Global\nCEO. “Travelzoo members are affluent, active, and open to new experiences. We inspire members to\ntravel to places they never imagined they could. Travelzoo is the must-have membership for those who\nlove to travel as much as we do.\"\nCash Position\nAs of September 30, 2024, consolidated cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $12.1 million.\nNet cash provided by operations was $5.3 million.\nTravelzoo North America\nNorth America business segment revenue decreased 4% year-over-year to $12.8 million. Operating\nprofit for Q3 2024 was $3.2 million, or 25% of revenue, compared to operating profit of $3.0 million in\nthe prior-year period.\nTravelzoo Europe\nEurope business segment revenue increased 1% year-over-year to $6.1 million. In constant currencies,\nEurope business segment revenue was $5.9 million. Operating profit for Q3 2024 was $1.0 million, or\n17% of revenue, compared to operating profit of $267,000 in the prior-year period.\nJack’s Flight Club\nJack’s Flight Club is a membership subscription service in which Travelzoo has a 60% ownership\ninterest. Revenue from unaffiliated customers increased 11% year-over-year to $1.2 million. The\nnumber of premium subscribers increased 14% year-over-year. Jack’s Flight Club’s revenue from\nsubscriptions is recognized ratably over the subscription period (quarterly, semi-annually, annually).\nNon-GAAP operating profit for Q3 2024 was $85,000. Non-GAAP operating profit excludes amortization\n2/10\nof intangibles ($58,000) related to the acquisition of Travelzoo’s ownership interest in Jack’s Flight Club\nin 2020.\nNew Initiatives\nNew Initiatives business segment revenue, which includes Licensing and Travelzoo META, was\n$33,000. Operating loss for Q3 2024 was $160,000.\nIn June 2020, Travelzoo entered into a royalty-bearing licensing agreement with a local licensee in\nJapan for the exclusive use of Travelzoo’s brand, business model, and members in Japan. In August of\n2020, Travelzoo entered into a royalty-bearing licensing agreement with a local licensee in Australia for\nthe exclusive use of Travelzoo’s brand, business models, and members in Australia, New Zealand, and\nSingapore. Under these arrangements, Travelzoo’s existing members in Australia, Japan, New\nZealand, and Singapore will continue to be owned by Travelzoo as the licensor. Travelzoo recorded\n$7,000 in licensing revenue from the licensee in Japan in Q3 2024. Travelzoo recorded $10,000 in\nlicensing revenue from the licensee in Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore in Q3 2024. Licensing\nrevenue is expected to increase going forward.\nMembers and Subscribers\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had 30.1 million members and subscribers worldwide. In North America,\nTravelzoo had 15.8 million unduplicated members as of September 30, 2024. In Europe, Travelzoo had\n9.1 million unduplicated members as of September 30, 2024. Jack’s Flight Club had 2.1 million\nsubscribers, including premium subscribers, as of September 30, 2024. Comparisons to prior periods\nare no longer meaningful due to strategic developments of the Travelzoo membership and Jack’s Flight\nClub premium subscriber acquisition. For Travelzoo, the average activity of members is increasing. For\nJack’s Flight Club, the premium subscribers are increasing.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn March 2020, Travelzoo decided to exit its Asia Pacific business and operate it as a licensing\nbusiness going forward. Consequently, the Asia Pacific business has been classified as discontinued\noperations.\n3/10\nIncome Taxes\nA provision of $1.1 million for income taxes was recorded for Q3 2024, compared to an income tax\nexpense of $1.0 million in the prior-year period. Travelzoo intends to utilize available net operating\nlosses (NOLs) to largely offset its actual tax liability for Q3 2024.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring Q3 2024, the Company repurchased 552,679 shares of its outstanding common stock.\nLooking Ahead\nFor Q4 2024, we expect growth in revenue year-over-year, albeit at a smaller pace than in 2023.\nHowever, there could be unexpected fluctuations. We also expect for Q4 2024 higher profitability year-\nover-year and quarter-over-quarter. For 2025, we expect substantial growth in revenue as a result of\nadditional revenue from membership fees.\nIn December 2023, we announced the introduction of a membership fee for Travelzoo beginning\nJanuary 1, 2024. We recognize membership fee revenue ratably over the subscription period. Legacy\nTravelzoo members as of December 31, 2023, which represent more than 95% of members, are\nexempt from the fee during 2024. Therefore, we do not anticipate membership fee revenue from these\nmembers before 2025.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nManagement calculates non-GAAP operating income when evaluating the financial performance of the\nbusiness. Travelzoo’s calculation of non-GAAP operating income, also called “non-GAAP operating\nprofit” in this press release and today’s earnings conference call, excludes the following items:\namortization of intangibles, stock option expenses and severance-related expenses. This press release\nincludes a table which reconciles GAAP operating income to the calculation of non-GAAP operating\nincome. Non-GAAP operating income is not required by, or presented in accordance with, generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). This information should be\nconsidered as supplemental in nature and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for\nthe financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures may not be the same as similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n4/10\nConference Call\nTravelzoo will host a conference call to discuss third quarter 2024 results today at 11:00 a.m. ET.\nPlease visit http://ir.travelzoo.com/events-presentations to\n• download the management presentation (PDF format) to be discussed in the conference call\n• access the webcast\nAbout Travelzoo\nWe, Travelzoo®, are the club for travel enthusiasts.

Company and Basis of Presentation\nTravelzoo (including its subsidiaries and affiliates, the “Company” or “we”) is a global Internet media company. It operates Travelzoo®, the club for\ntravel enthusiasts, and Jack’s Flight Club®, a subscription service that provides information about exceptional airfares. Travelzoo has more than 30 million\nmembers.\nThrough its websites, e-mails newsletters, iOS and Android apps, and social media channels, Travelzoo provides members information and access to\nexclusive discounted travel, entertainment, and local offers and experiences. Offers are researched, negotiated, and personally selected by Travelzoo’s deal\nexperts around the globe. Offers are sourced from more than 5,000 top travel and entertainment partners.\nThe Company generates revenues from advertising, membership fees, and other sources.\nIn March 2022, the Company began the development of Travelzoo META, a subscription service that is intended to provide Metaverse travel\nexperiences.\nAPAC Exit and Pivot to Licensing Model\nIn March 2020, Travelzoo exited its loss-making Asia Pacific business and pivoted to a licensing model. The Company’s Asia Pacific business was\nclassified as discontinued operations as of March 31, 2020.\nTravelzoo currently has license agreements covering Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea. The license agreements provide the\nlicensees exclusive rights to use Travelzoo products, services and intellectual property in each jurisdiction in exchange for quarterly royalty payments based\nupon net revenue over a five-year term, with an option to renew.\nOwnership\nRalph Bartel, who founded Travelzoo, is the sole beneficiary of the Ralph Bartel 2005 Trust, which is the controlling shareholder of Azzurro Capital Inc.\nAzzurro Capital Inc. is the Company’s largest shareholder, and as of September 30, 2024, holds approximately 40.8% of the Company's outstanding shares.\nFinancial Statements\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in accordance with the rules and\nregulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial\nstatements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted in\naccordance with such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all\nadjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to state fairly the financial position of the Company and its results of operations and\ncash flows. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial\nstatements and related notes as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in the Company’s Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 22, 2024.\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and\ntransactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities where the Company does not have control, but does have significant influence, are\naccounted for as equity method investments. We have reclassified prior period financial statements to conform to the current period presentation.\n10\nManagement of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and\nthe disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.\nSignificant estimates included in the consolidated financial statements and related notes include revenue recognition, refund liability, income taxes, stock-based\ncompensation, loss contingencies, useful lives of property and equipment, purchase price allocation for the business combination and related impairment\nassessment, relating to the projections and assumptions used. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The results of operations for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024 or any other future\nperiod, and the Company makes no representations related thereto.\n(b) Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Standards Accounting Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07 \"Segment Reporting (Topic\n280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\", which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily\nthrough enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim\nperiods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential effect that the updated\nstandard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\", to expand the disclosure\nrequirements for income taxes, primarily requiring more detailed disclosure for income taxes paid and the effective tax rate reconciliation. ASU 2023-09 is\neffective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted and can be applied on either a prospective or\nretroactive basis. We are currently evaluating the ASU to determine its impact on our income tax disclosures.\n(c) Significant Accounting Policies\nBelow is a summary of the Company's significant accounting policies. For a comprehensive description of our accounting policies, refer to our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company follows Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606), under which revenue is\nrecognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled\nto in exchange for those goods or services.\nThe Company's revenues consist of (1) advertising revenues and commissions, derived from and generated in connection with purchases made by\nTravelzoo members, (2) membership fees and (3) other.\nAdvertising Revenues and Commissions\nAdvertising revenues are generated from the publishing of travel and entertainment deals on the Travelzoo website, in Top 20 email newsletters, in\nStandalone email newsletters and through the Travelzoo Network. The Company also generates transaction-based commission revenues from the sale of\nvouchers (our Local Deals and Getaways offerings), operation of our hotel booking platform and limited offerings of vacation packages.\nSpecifically, for fixed-fee website advertising, the Company recognizes revenues ratably over the contracted placement period. For Top 20 email\nnewsletters and other email products, the Company recognizes revenues when the emails are delivered to its members. For cost-per-click advertising, whereby\nan advertiser pays the Company when a user clicks on an ad (typically served on Travelzoo properties or Travelzoo Network partner properties), the Company\nrecognizes revenues each time a user clicks on the ad.\nThe Company also offers clients other advertising models whereby an advertiser pays the Company based on the number of times their advertisement is\ndisplayed (whether on Travelzoo properties, email advertisements, Travelzoo Network properties, social platforms or other media properties). For these\ninstances, the Company recognizes revenues each time an ad is displayed.\nFor transaction-based advertising revenues, including from products such as Local Deals and Getaways prepaid voucher sales, hotel platform bookings\nand vacation package sales, the Company evaluates whether it is acting as principal (thereby reporting revenue on a gross basis) versus agent (thereby reporting\nrevenue on a net basis). Accordingly, the Company reports transaction-based advertising revenues on a net basis, as third-party suppliers are primarily\nresponsible for fulfilling the underlying good or service, which the Company does not control prior to its transfer to the customer.\n11\nFor Local Deals and Getaways prepaid voucher sales, the Company earns a fee for acting as an agent on the sale, while vouchers can subsequently be\nredeemed for goods or services with third-party merchants. Commission revenues are, accordingly, presented net of amounts due to third-party merchants for\nfulfilling the underlying goods and services, and net of estimated future refunds to consumers, as the terms of the vouchers permit. Certain merchant contracts\nallow the Company to retain the proceeds from unredeemed vouchers. With these contracts, the Company estimates the value of vouchers that will ultimately\nnot be redeemed and records the estimate as revenues in the same period.\nCommission revenues generated from bookings on our hotel platform are recognized ratably over the periods of guest stays, net of an allowance for\nestimated cancellations, based upon historical patterns. For bookings of non-cancelable reservations, where the Company’s performance obligation is deemed\nto be completed upon the successful booking, the Company records commission revenue at such time.\nIn certain instances, the Company’s contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations, whereby the Company allocates revenues to\neach performance obligation based on its standalone selling price. The Company determines standalone selling prices based on overall pricing objectives,\ntaking into consideration the type of goods or services, geographical region of the customers, rate card pricing and customary discounts. Standalone selling\nprices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers when the good or service is sold separately.\nThe Company relies upon certain practical expedients and exemptions provided for in Topic 606. The Company expenses sales commissions when\nincurred, as the amortization period would be one year or less, which are recorded in sales and marketing expenses. In addition, the Company does not disclose\nthe value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less, and contracts for which it recognizes\nrevenues at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed.\nMembership Fee Revenues\nMembership fee revenues are generated from subscription fees paid by Travelzoo, Jack's Flight Club and Travelzoo META members. We recognize\nsubscription revenues ratably over the subscription periods.\nTravelzoo membership has historically been free, however, on January 1, 2024, Travelzoo introduced an annual membership fee of $40 (or local\nequivalent) for new members in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Germany, with the 2024 annual fee waived for existing members as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues include licensing fees, fees generated from the existing retail business acquired by the Company when it acquired MTE.\nDeferred Revenues\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of deferred membership fees, customer prepayments and undelivered Company performance obligations related to\ncontracts comprising multiple performance obligations. As of December 31, 2023, $1.5 million was recorded as deferred revenue for Jack's Flight Club, of\nwhich $1.4 million was recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, $569,000 was recorded as deferred revenue for Travelzoo North America\nand Travelzoo Europe, of which $559,000 was recognized as revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the deferred\nrevenue balance was $3.9 million, of which $2.3 million was for Jack's Flight Club and the remaining $1.5 million was for Travelzoo North America and\nTravelzoo Europe.\nReserve for Refunds to Members\nThe Company estimates and records a reserve for future refunds on member purchases of Local Deals and Getaways vouchers, at the time revenue is\nrecorded. We consider various factors such as historical refund timeframes from dates of sale, reasons for refunds, time periods remaining until expiration,\nchanges in refund procedures and estimates of redemptions and breakage. Should any of these factors change, the estimates made by management will also\nchange, which could impact the level of our future reserve for refunds to members. Specifically, if the financial condition of our merchant partners, on behalf of\nwhom vouchers are sold, were to deteriorate, affecting their ability to provide the goods or services to our members, additional reserves for refunds to members\nmay be required and may adversely affect future revenues as the liability is recorded against revenue.\nThe Company's refund policy is a 14-day refund period from date of purchase, with an option to extend refund eligibility until voucher redemption or\nexpiration, for a surcharge. As of September 30, 2024, the expiration dates of unexpired vouchers ranged from October 2024 through December 2025;\nprovided, that expiration dates may sometimes be extended on a case-by-case basis and final payments to merchants upon expiration may not be due for up to a\nyear later.\n12\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $4.3 million of unredeemed vouchers that had been sold, representing the Company’s\ncommission earned. The Company estimated and recorded a refund reserve of $142,000 for these unredeemed vouchers as of September 30, 2024, which is\nrecorded as a reduction of revenues on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and accrued expenses and other on the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $5.2 million of unredeemed vouchers that had been sold representing the Company’s\ncommission earned from the sale and estimated a refund reserve of $268,000 for these unredeemed vouchers as of December 31, 2023, as a reduction of\nrevenues on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and accrued expenses and other on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.\nIf our judgments regarding estimated member refunds are inaccurate, reported results of operations could differ from amounts previously accrued.\nMerchant payables of $17.3 million as of September 30, 2024 is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet, representing amounts payable to merchants by the\nCompany for vouchers sold but not redeemed.\nIdentifiable intangible assets\nUpon acquisition, identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Identifiable intangible\nassets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The carrying values of all intangible assets are reviewed for\nimpairment annually, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets.\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment annually, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable. The\nCompany performs an impairment test by comparing the book value of the reporting unit to the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing a combination of\nvaluation techniques, including an income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (guideline company method). The Company performed its\nannual impairment testing as of October 31, 2023 and no impairment charge was identified in connection with the annual impairment test. The Company did\nnot identify any indicators of impairment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nOperating Leases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities are\nrecognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. The lease payments used to determine\nthe operating lease assets may include lease incentives and stated rent increases. The Company does not include options to extend or terminate until it is\nreasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental\nborrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the lease liabilities, as the Company’s leases generally do not\nprovide an implicit rate. The Company elected not to recognize leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on its unaudited condensed consolidated balance\nsheets.\nThe Company’s leases are reflected in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities and long-term operating lease liabilities on our unaudited\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets. The lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nCertain Risks and Uncertainties\nThe Company’s business is subject to risks associated with its ability to attract and retain advertisers and offer goods or services on compelling terms to\nour members.\nThe Company’s cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash and cash equivalents are\nplaced with financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality. Accounts receivables are derived from revenue earned from customers\nlocated in the U.S. and internationally. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any customers that accounted for 10% or\nmore of accounts receivable.\n13\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had merchant payables of $17.3 million related to the sale of vouchers. In the Company’s financial statements\npresented in this 10-Q report, following GAAP accounting principles, we classified all merchant payables as current. As such, the consolidated balance sheet\nreflects negative net working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) of $7.0 million at September 30, 2024. Payables to merchants are\ngenerally due upon redemption of vouchers by members who purchased them from the Company. As of September 30, 2024, unredeemed vouchers have\nmaturities ranging from October 2024 through December 2025; however, expiration dates may be extended on a case-by-case basis and final payment to\nmerchants upon expiration may not be due for up to a year after. Based on current projections of future redemption activity, management expects that cash on\nhand as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to provide for working capital needs for at least the next twelve months.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less on the date of purchase. Restricted cash includes cash and\ncash equivalents that is restricted through legal contracts, regulations or our intention to use the cash for a specific purpose. Our restricted cash primarily relates\nto refundable for leases.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the unaudited condensed consolidated balance\nsheets to the total amounts shown in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 11,429 $ 15,713\nRestricted cash 675 675\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash–discontinued operations 2 1\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the condensed consolidated statements\nof cash flows $ 12,106 $ 16,389\nThe Company’s restricted cash was included in noncurrent assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nNote 2: Net Income Per Share\nBasic net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per\nshare is computed by adjusting the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding\nduring the period. Potential common shares included in the diluted calculation consist of incremental shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock\noptions calculated using the treasury stock method.\n14\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet income attributable to Travelzoo—continuing operations $ 3,184 $ 2,353 $ 10,347 $ 8,652\nNet loss attributable to Travelzoo—discontinued operations $ — $ (5) $ — $ (5)\nDenominator:\nWeighted average common shares—basic 12,176 14,769 12,851 15,242\nEffect of dilutive securities: stock options 210 52 184 65\nWeighted average common shares—diluted 12,386 14,821 13,035 15,307\nIncome per share—basic\nContinuing operations $ 0.26 $ 0.16 $ 0.81 $ 0.57\nDiscontinued operations — — — —\nNet income per share —basic $ 0.26 $ 0.16 $ 0.81 $ 0.57\nIncome per share—diluted\nContinuing operations $ 0.26 $ 0.16 $ 0.79 $ 0.57\nDiscontinued operations — — — —\nNet income per share—diluted $ 0.26 $ 0.16 $ 0.79 $ 0.56\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, options to purchase 612,500 shares of common stock were not included in the computation of\ndiluted net income per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, options to\npurchase 950,000 and 750,000 shares of common stock, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share because the effect\nwould have been anti-dilutive.\nNote 3: Acquisitions\nJack’s Flight Club\nIn January 2020, the Company acquired a 60% interest in JFC Travel Group Co. (“Jack’s Flight Club”), which operates Jack’s Flight Club, a subscription\nservice that provides members with information about exceptional airfares.\nStock Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) between Travelzoo and Azzurro\nIn connection with the acquisition of Metaverse Travel Experiences (“MTE”), formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of Azzurro, the Company completed a\nprivate placement of newly issued shares with Azzurro. Ralph Bartel, who founded the Company, is the sole beneficiary of the Ralph Bartel 2005 Trust, which\nis the controlling shareholder of Azzurro. Azzurro was the Company’s largest shareholder at the time of the MTE acquisition and, as of December 31, 2022,\nAzzurro and Ralph Bartel, in his individual capacity, owned approximately 50.3% of the Company’s outstanding shares. On December 28, 2022, the\nstockholders of Travelzoo approved the issuance and sale of 3.4 million shares of common stock (the “Shares”) of Travelzoo to Azzurro, in exchange for\ncertain consideration, and on December 30, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), the transaction was consummated. The closing price of Travelzoo’s common stock on\nDecember 30, 2022 was $4.45 per share, resulting in an aggregate fair value of the Shares of $15.2 million. The consideration for the Shares consisted of the\nfollowing: (a) $1.0 million in cash paid on the Closing Date; (b) $4.8 million paid in the form of a promissory note, carrying a 12% interest rate per annum,\nissued on the Closing Date and payable by June 30, 2023; and (c) the transfer to the Company of all outstanding capital stock of MTE, which was effected\npursuant to a merger of MTE with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company on the Closing Date. The Company records the $4.8 million promissory note as\nNote receivable from shareholder in the stockholders’ equity section. In October 2023, the Company and Azzurro agreed to a payment plan for payment of the\npromissory note in five installments, ending in February 2024, with interest on the outstanding principal accruing at 16% per annum beginning on July 1, 2023.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, Azzurro paid $3.0 million of principal. Azzurro paid interest of $70,000 and $190,000 in the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Azzurro paid interest of $210,000 and\n15\n$475,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The remaining principal amount of $1.8 million, together with interest of\n$19,000, was paid off in October 2024.\nIntangible Assets\nThe following table represents the fair value and estimated useful lives of intangible assets from acquisitions (in thousands):\nFair Value Estimated Life (Years)\nCustomer relationships (Jack’s Flight Club) $ 3,500 5.0\nTrade name (Jack’s Flight Club) 2,460 indefinite\nNon-compete agreements (Jack’s Flight Club) 660 4.0\nSecret Escapes Spain member database 445 3.0\nSecret Escapes U.S. member database 1,751 2.3\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis\nThe Company’s non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment, are adjusted to fair value if an impairment is\nrecognized during the period. The fair value measurements are based on Level 3 inputs which are unobservable inputs based on management assumptions used\nto measure assets at fair value.\nThe goodwill assessment was performed by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their carrying value. The fair value estimates for the\nreporting units were based on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market value approach, using Level 3 inputs. The\nindefinite-lived intangible assets assessment was performed using the relief-from-royalty method, which includes unobservable inputs, classified as Level 3,\nincluding projected revenues and approximately 5% royalty rate.\nThe Company performed an annual impairment test in October 2023 and did not identify any indicators of impairment for the year ended December 31,\n2023.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangible Assets\nThe following table represents the activities of intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nJack’s Flight Club Secret Escape Spain Secret Escape U.S.\nIntangible assets—December 31, 2022 $ 2,351 $ 327 $ 973\nAmortization of intangible assets with definite lives (168) (39) (195)\nIntangible assets—March 31, 2023 2,183 288 778\nAmortization of intangible assets with definite lives (158) (36) (194)\nIntangible assets—June 30, 2023 2,025 252 584\nAmortization of intangible assets with definite lives (157) $ (29) $ (195)\nIntangible assets—September 30, 2023 1,868 223 389\nAmortization of intangible assets with definite lives (158) (37) (194)\nIntangible assets—December 31, 2023 1,710 186 195\nAmortization of intangible assets with definite lives (75) (48) (195)\nIntangible assets—March 31, 2024 1,635 138 —\nAmortization of intangible assets with definite lives (59) (28) —\nIntangible assets—June 30, 2024 1,576 110 —\nAmortization of intangible assets with definite lives (58) (37) —\nIntangible assets—September 30, 2024 $ 1,518 $ 73 $ —\nAmortization expense for acquired intangibles was $95,000 and $381,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAmortization expense for acquired intangibles was $500,000 and $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n16\nExpected future amortization expense of acquired intangible assets as of September 30, 2024 is as follows (in thousands):\nYears ending December 31,\n2024 (excluding the nine months ended September 30, 2024) 94\n2025 47\n$ 141\nThe Company performed its annual impairment testing of Trade name as of October 31, 2023 using a relief from royalty method. No impairment was\nidentified in 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of the Trade name was $1.5 million. The Company did not identify any indicators of\nimpairment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nNote 4: Commitments and Contingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to various claims and legal proceedings, either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. The Company accrues for legal contingencies if the Company can estimate the potential liability and believes it is probable that the matter will be\nruled on adversely. Accruals for legal contingencies were not material as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. If a legal claim for which the\nCompany did not accrue is resolved against it, the Company would record the expense in the period in which the ruling was made. The Company believes that\nthe likelihood of an ultimate amount of liability, if any, for any pending claims of any type (alone or combined) that will materially affect the Company’s\nfinancial position, results of operations or cash flows is remote. The ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain, however, and unfavorable outcomes could\nhave a material negative impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.

It operates Travelzoo®, the club for\ntravel enthusiasts, and Jack’s Flight Club®, a subscription service that provides information about exceptional airfares. Travelzoo has more than 30 million\nmembers.\nThrough its websites, e-mails newsletters, iOS and Android apps, and social media channels, Travelzoo provides members information and access to\nexclusive discounted travel, entertainment, and local offers and experiences. Offers are researched, negotiated, and personally selected by Travelzoo’s deal\nexperts around the globe. Offers are sourced from more than 5,000 top travel and entertainment partners.\nThe Company generates revenues from advertising, membership fees, and other sources.\nIn March 2022, the Company began the development of Travelzoo META, a subscription service that is intended to provide Metaverse travel\nexperiences.\nWe also license Travelzoo products, services and intellectual property to licenses in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea. In each\ncase, the Company is entitled to a quarterly royalty payment based on a percentage of net revenue. The Company recognized $18,000 in royalties in each of the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company recognized $53,000 and $39,000 in royalties in the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. Under the licensing agreements, Travelzoo's existing member list in the applicable territories continues to be owned by the Company.\nIn May 2023 we launched Travelzoo META, to extend the range of experiences we offer consumers in the emerging metaverse. This paid membership\nservice currently provides founding members with a limited edition “Travel Companion” non-fungible token (“NFT”) and future access to beta version\nmetaverse travel experiences, as developed. In December 2022, we acquired Metaverse Travel Experiences, Inc., now Metaverse Travel Experiences, LLC\n(“MTE”), to support Travelzoo META in sourcing prospective metaverse travel experiences. MTE also continues to operate its legacy business in retail and\nfashion, which is included in but not material to the Company’s consolidated results. See Note 3—Acquisitions to the accompanying condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements included in this report for further information regarding the acquisition of MTE.\nAPAC Exit and Pivot to Licensing Model\nIn March 2020, Travelzoo exited its loss-making Asia Pacific business and pivoted to a licensing model. The Company’s Asia Pacific business was\nclassified as discontinued operations as of March 31, 2020.\nTravelzoo currently has license agreements covering Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea. The license agreement for Australia,\nNew Zealand and Singapore provides the licensee exclusive rights to use Travelzoo products, services and intellectual property in each jurisdiction in exchange\nfor quarterly royalty payments based upon net revenue over a five-year term, with an option to renew. The Company recognized royalties of $11,000 and\n$9,000 from the licensee for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recognized royalties of $32,000 and $26,000\nfrom the licensee for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n26\nThe license agreement for Japan and South Korea provides the licensee exclusive rights to use Travelzoo products, services, and intellectual property in\nexchange for quarterly royalty payments based on net revenue over a five-year term, with an option to renew. An interest free loan was provided to the licensee\nfor JPY 46 million (approximately $430,000), of which $133,000 was repaid in 2021 and the remaining amount repaid in 2023. The Company recognized\nroyalties of $7,000 and $9,000 from the licensee for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recognized royalties of\n$21,000 and $13,000 from the licensee for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nReportable Segments\nThe Company determines its reportable segments based upon the Company's chief operating decision maker managing the performance of the business.\nThe Company currently has four reportable operating segments: Travelzoo North America, Travelzoo Europe, Jack’s Flight Club and New Initiatives.\nTravelzoo North America consists of the Company’s operations in the U.S. and Canada. Travelzoo Europe consists of the Company’s operations in France,\nGermany, Spain and the U.K. Jack’s Flight Club consists of subscription revenues from premium members to access and receive flight deals from Jack’s Flight\nClub via email or mobile applications. New Initiatives consists of Travelzoo’s licensing business, the Travelzoo META subscription service and MTE.\nFinancial information with respect to our business segments and certain financial information about geographic areas appears in Note 9–Segment Reporting\nand Significant Customer Information to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nWhen evaluating the financial condition and operating performance of the Company, management focuses on financial and non-financial indicators such\nas growth in the number of members to the Company’s newsletters, operating margin, growth in revenues in the absolute and relative to the growth in reach of\nthe Company’s publications measured as revenue per member and revenue per employee as a measure of productivity.\nHow We Generate Revenues\nTravelzoo\nRevenues from the Travelzoo brand and business are generated primarily from three categories: Advertising, Membership Fees, and Other.\nThe \"Advertising\" category consists primarily of (a) advertising fees paid by travel companies for the publishing of their offers on Travelzoo’s media\nproperties, (b) commission generated from the sale of Getaways vouchers and bookings on our hotel platform, and (c) publishing fees from high-quality local\nbusinesses, sale of Local Deals vouchers and entertainment offers. Advertising fees may be based on audience reach, placement in email newsletters or on\nmedia properties, number of listings, number of clicks, and/or actual sales. We typically recognize advertising revenues upon delivery of emails or clicks, as\ntracked by our internal platform or third-party platforms, in the period of the applicable insertion orders, which are typically for periods between one month and\ntwelve months and are not automatically renewed. For Getaways vouchers, we recognize a percentage of the face value of vouchers upon sale as commission,\nnet of an allowance for future refunds. Merchant agreements for Getaways advertisers are typically for periods between twelve and twenty-four months and are\nnot automatically renewed. Revenues generated from local business offers are based upon a percentage of the face value of the vouchers sold, commission on\nactual sales or a listing fee based on audience reach. We recognize revenue upon the sale of vouchers, upon notification of the amount of direct bookings or\nupon delivery of emails. For Local Deals vouchers, we recognize a percentage of the face value of vouchers upon the sale of the vouchers, net of an allowance\nfor refunds. Insertion orders and merchant agreements for Local Deals are typically for periods between one and twelve months and are not automatically\nrenewed.\nIn the second quarter of 2020, due to the global pandemic and various stay-at-home protocols, the Company expanded its voucher refund policy to fully\nrefundable until the voucher expires or is redeemed by the customer. This refund policy was reverted in April 2022 to a 14-day refund period from date of\npurchase, with a newly introduced option to extend refund eligibility until voucher redemption or expiration, for a surcharge. The expiration dates of vouchers\nrange between October 2024 through December 2025; provided, that these expiration dates may sometimes be extended on a case-by-case basis and final\npayment to merchants upon expiration may not be due for up to a year later.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $4.3 million and $5.2 million of unredeemed vouchers that had been\nsold, respectively, representing the Company’s commission. The Company estimates a refund reserve using historical and current refund rates by product and\nby merchant location to calculate estimated future refunds. The Company estimated and recorded a refund reserve of $142,000 and $268,000 as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, for these unredeemed vouchers which is recorded as a reduction of revenues on the consolidated\nstatements of operations, and accrued expense and other on the consolidated balance sheet.\n27\nMerchant payables of $17.3 million as of September 30, 2024 related to unredeemed vouchers is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet, representing\namounts payable to merchants by the Company for vouchers sold but not redeemed. Certain merchant contracts, typically in foreign locations, allow the\nCompany to retain the proceeds from unredeemed vouchers upon expiration. With these contracts, the Company estimates the value of vouchers that will\nultimately not be redeemed and records the estimate as revenues in the same period.\nThe \"Membership Fees\" category consists of subscription fees paid by Travelzoo, Jack's Flight Club, and Travelzoo META members. Travelzoo®\nmembership has historically been free, however, on January 1, 2024, Travelzoo introduced an annual membership fee of $40 (or local equivalent) for new\nmembers in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Germany, with the 2024 annual fee waived for existing members as of December 31, 2023. Jack’s\nFlight Club subscription options are quarterly, semi-annually, and annually. We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the respective subscription\nperiods. For Travelzoo META, a founding membership was launched in 2022 following a test-and-learn strategy.\nThe \"Other\" category consists of licensing fees from license agreements, as well as the retail business originally operated by MTE and acquired and\nmaintained by the Company following the acquisition of MTE.\nTrends in Our Business\nOur ability to generate revenues in the future depends on numerous factors, including those relating to members, advertisers, competitors, the travel\nindustry, the online advertising business, internal factors and external factors.\nFactors relating to members include their willingness to purchase the deals we advertise, their demand for vouchers as a promotional format, and with the\nintroduction of membership fees for new members in 2024 and existing members in 2025, our ability to enroll new paying members and transition existing\nmembers to paid membership, without adversely affecting our membership base and existing advertising revenue streams.\nFactors relating to advertisers include our ability to sell more advertising to existing and new advertisers, our ability to enhance our audience reach and\nadvertising rates, spending controls by travel intermediaries to focus on improving profitability, and advertiser shifts from one advertising service (e.g. Top 20)\nto another (e.g. Local Deals and Getaways). Advertiser shifts between advertising services could result in no incremental revenue or less revenue than in\nprevious periods, depending on amounts purchased, and in particular with Local Deals and Getaways, depending on how many vouchers are purchased by\nmembers.\nFactors relating to competitors include the willingness of certain competitors to grow their business unprofitably. Factors relating to the travel industry\ninclude lingering effects of the global pandemic, geopolitical tensions affecting consumer travel to certain regions, and risk of future unforeseeable macro\nevents that impact travel, while factors relating to the online advertising business include shifts in consumer use of different digital media formats such as from\ndesktop to mobile, from mobile web to mobile app, and from email to push notifications and SMS text messaging.\nInternal factors include risks relating to our ability to continue to service members without interruption, our ability to develop and launch new products\nmembers will utilize and advertisers will adopt, and hiring and relying on key employees for the continued maintenance and growth of our business.\nExternal factors include the introduction of new methods of advertising, the relative condition of the economy, cybersecurity risks due to increased\ndependence on digital technologies, and climate change and related legislation, to the extent such legislation impacts the businesses of our advertisers such as\nairlines and cruise ship operators, which have come under increasing scrutiny for their carbon footprints.\nRevenues from local business have been and may continue to decline over time due to market conditions driven by competition and declines in consumer\ndemand. In the last several years, we have seen a decline in the number of vouchers sold and a decrease in the average commission rate earned by us from the\nmerchants for vouchers sold. However, during the global pandemic, we saw an increase in demand by consumers for fully refundable travel options, which led\nto a slight reversal of this trend and an increase in the sale of Getaways hotel vouchers (although demand for restaurants and spas continued to be low). With\nthe ending of the pandemic, the importance of fully refundable travel options has decreased (and we also shifted to offering a surcharge for full refundability),\nand the trend is therefore returning to pre-pandemic patterns.\n28\nOur ability to continue generating revenues through advertising, commissions and subscriptions depends heavily upon our ability to maintain and grow\nan attractive audience for our publications. We monitor our membership base to assess our efforts to maintain and grow our audience reach. We obtain\nadditional members and activity on our websites by acquiring traffic from Internet search and social media companies. The costs to grow our audience have\nhad, and we expect will continue to have, a significant impact on our financial results and can vary from period to period. With the introduction of membership\nfees in 2024, we have been adjusting our user acquisition strategies whose timeframes to become effective are uncertain. While we are initially reducing our\nexpenditures on acquiring traffic as we test new strategies for efficacy, in time we plan to increase these expenditures to maintain or grow our membership,\naudience and the reach of our publications. We continue to see a shift in users accessing our services through mobile devices and social media and, therefore,\nanticipate continuing to address this growing channel through additional investments in mobile app development.\nWe believe that an important factor for our advertising rates is the reach of our publications, however, we also believe that there are other important\nfactors, such as the engagement of our membership base with our content. We do not know if we will be able to increase the reach of our publications,\nparticularly with the introduction of membership fees in 2024. We do not know if by increasing the reach of our publications, we will also be able to increase\nengagement and other key metrics of importance to our advertisers. If we are able to increase the reach of our publications, we still may not be able to or want\nto increase rates given market conditions, including intense competition in our industry. Even if we increase our rates, the increased price may reduce the\nnumber of advertisers willing to advertise with us and could, therefore, decrease our revenue. We may need to decrease our rates based on competitive market\nconditions and the performance of our audience in order to maintain or grow our revenue.\nWe do not know what our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues will be in future periods. Our cost of revenues may change in relation to volume\nand terms with third-party partners of the Travelzoo network, the incurrence of merchant processing fees from the sale of vouchers for Local Deals and\nGetaways and payment of membership fees, changes in refund request trends and provisioning of customer service. We expect fluctuations in cost of revenues\nas a percentage of revenues from quarter to quarter. Some of the fluctuations may be significant and may have a material impact on our results of operations.\nWe do not know what our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue will be in future periods. Changes in the average cost per acquisition\nof new members impacts our advertising expenses and sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue, and are not readily predictable. With the\nintroduction of membership fees in 2024, we expect the cost of acquiring new paying members to increase significantly, as compared with the cost of acquiring\nnon-paying members prior to 2024. We are early in the development of new strategies to acquire paying members, so our test budgets have not yet fully scaled.\nHowever, as we test new strategies and gain more learnings as to acquiring paying members, our expenditures may increase significantly. We hope efficiencies\nwe have gained through our testing will scale as well. In addition, there may be a significant number of members that cancel or we may cancel their\nmemberships for various reasons, which may prompt us to spend more on member acquisition in order to replace lost members.\nIn addition to the type of membership offered, we believe the average cost per acquisition depends mainly on the advertising rates we pay for media\nbuys, the quality of the members we acquire, our ability to manage our member acquisition efforts successfully, the regions we target to acquire new members\nand the relative costs for that region, and the degree of competition in our industry. All else equal, increased competition may require us to increase advertising\nfor our brand and advertisers’ deals.\nBeside member acquisition costs, we may see a unique opportunity for a brand marketing campaign, experience increases in the cost of retaining or\nsourcing new advertiser clients, or change the number of personnel or compensation structure for the Sales and marketing function, any of which would result\nin an increase in sales and marketing expenses. We expect fluctuations in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue from year to year and from\nquarter to quarter. Some of the fluctuations may be significant and have a material impact on our results of operations. We expect increased marketing expenses\nto spur continued growth in revenue in future periods; however, we cannot be assured of this due to the many factors that impact our growth. We expect to\nadjust the level of such incremental spending dynamically during any given quarter based upon market conditions, as well as our performance in each quarter.\nWe do not know what our product development expenses as a percentage of revenue will be in future periods. We expect to increase investment in our\nproducts in connection with building out and refining the value proposition of the Travelzoo membership. There may be fluctuations that have a material\nimpact on our results of operations. Product development changes may lead to reductions of revenue based on changes in receptivity of our offerings to our\nmember audience and advertiser clients. We expect our efforts in developing products and services will continue to be a focus in the future, which may lead to\nincreased product development expenses. Increases in expense may result from costs related to third-party technology service providers and software licenses,\nheadcount and the use of professional services.\n29\nWe do not know what our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will be in future periods. There may be fluctuations that have a\nmaterial impact on our results of operations.\nWe do not know what our income taxes will be in future periods. There may be fluctuations that have a material impact on our results of operations. Our\nincome taxes are dependent on numerous factors such as the geographic mix of our taxable income, foreign, federal, state and local tax law and regulations,\nand changes thereto. Our income taxes are also dependent on the determination of whether valuation allowances for certain tax assets are required or not, any\naudits of prior years' tax returns that result in adjustments, resolution of uncertain tax positions and different treatments for certain items for tax versus book\npurposes. We expect fluctuations in our income taxes from year to year and from quarter to quarter, which may be significant and have a material impact on our\nresults of operations.\nDue to the adverse effects of the global pandemic, the Company reduced expenditures in many areas, including but not limited to, marketing, technology\nand human resources. For example, in 2020, the Company ceased operations in Asia Pacific, conducted employee furloughs and restructured its operations\nsignificantly. The Company also renegotiated many of its outstanding contractual obligations with vendors and closed some ancillary office locations. We do\nnot currently anticipate that additional cost-cutting measures will be necessary. In the foreseeable future, we anticipate relatively slow growth in fixed costs for\nour existing business, while investing in new initiatives where we see opportunities to expand our business, in aggregate, in-line with the trend of our revenues.\nThe key elements of our growth strategy include building our trusted travel, entertainment and local brands, refining and building out the value\nproposition of our membership and consequently increasing the value and engagement of our members, sourcing more exclusive and compelling offers from\ntravel and entertainment partners, and innovating with new experiences and revenue streams. We expect to continue our efforts to grow; however, we may not\ngrow or we may experience slower growth.\nWe believe that we can sell more advertising if the market for online advertising continues to grow and if we can maintain or increase our market share.\nWe believe the market for advertising continues to shift from offline to online. We do not know if we will be able to maintain or increase our market share. We\ndo not know if we will be able to increase the number of our advertisers in the future. We do not know if we will have market acceptance of our new products\nor whether the market will continue to accept our existing products.\n30\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, as a percentage of total revenues, the results from our operations for the periods indicated.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nCost of revenues 12.7 12.9 12.2 13.0\nGross profit 87.3 87.1 87.8 87.0\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing 41.0 47.8 41.5 46.2\nProduct development 3.0 2.5 2.8 2.4\nGeneral and administrative 23.2 21.7 21.9 20.8\nTotal operating expenses 67.2 72.0 66.2 69.4\nOperating income 20.1 15.1 21.6 17.6\nOther income, net 1.8 1.5 1.1 1.8\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes 21.9 16.6 22.7 19.4\nIncome tax expense 5.7 4.9 6.2 5.5\nIncome from continuing operations 16.2 11.7 16.5 13.9\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of taxes — — — —\nNet income 16.2 11.7 16.5 13.9\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest 0.4 0.3 0.1 0.2\nNet income attributable to Travelzoo 15.8 % 11.4 % 16.4 % 13.7 %\n31\nOperating Metrics\nThe following table sets forth, as a percentage of total revenues, the results from our operations for the periods indicated.\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nNorth America\nTotal members (1) 15,805,000 16,340,000\nAverage cost per acquisition of a new member $ 2.27 $ 2.78\nRevenue per member (2) $ 3.38 $ 3.47\nRevenue per employee (3) $ 458,000 $ 434,000\nMobile application downloads 4,220,000 4,158,000\nSocial media followers 3,323,000 3,265,000\nEurope\nTotal members (1) 9,056,000 9,302,000\nAverage cost per acquisition of a new member $ 2.97 $ 3.71\nRevenue per member (2) $ 2.70 $ 2.62\nRevenue per employee (3) $ 249,000 $ 243,000\nMobile application downloads 2,409,000 2,356,000\nSocial media followers 1,012,000 898,000\nJack's Flight Club\nTotal members 2,081,000 2,325,000\nOther locations 3,172,000 3,221,000\nConsolidated\nTotal members (1) 30,114,000 31,188,000\nAverage cost per acquisition of a new member $ 2.53 $ 3.15\nRevenue per member (2) $ 2.80 $ 2.71\nRevenue per employee (3) $ 362,000 $ 352,000\nMobile application downloads 7,736,000 7,524,000\nSocial media followers 4,336,000 4,163,000\n(1) Members represent individuals who receive one or more of our email publications.\n(2) Annualized revenue divided by number of members at the beginning of the year.\n(3) Annualized revenue divided by number of employees at the end of the quarter.\n32\nRevenues\nThe following table sets forth the breakdown of revenues (in thousands) by category Advertising, Membership Fees, and Other.

Our\neffective tax rate from continuing operations was 26% and 30%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company’s\neffective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 changed from the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a decrease of non-\ndeductible expenses in certain jurisdictions in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Income tax expense was $3.9 million and $3.5 million, respectively,\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 27% and 28% for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 changed from the three months\nended September 30, 2023 primarily due to a decrease of non-deductible expenses in certain jurisdictions in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023.

See Note 5–Income Taxes to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for further\ninformation.\nWe do not know what our income taxes will be in future periods. There may be fluctuations that have a material impact on our results of operations. Our\nincome taxes are dependent on numerous factors such as the geographic mix of our taxable income, federal and state and foreign country tax law and\nregulations and changes thereto, the determination of whether valuation allowances for certain tax assets are required or not, audits of prior years’ tax returns\nresulting in adjustments, resolution of uncertain tax positions and different treatment for certain items for tax versus books. We expect fluctuations in our\nincome taxes from year to year and from quarter to quarter. Some of the fluctuations may be significant and have a material impact on our results of operations.\nTravelzoo North America\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In thousands) (In thousands)\nRevenues $ 12,822 $ 13,408 $ 41,184 $ 42,299\nOperating profit $ 3,150 $ 3,015 $ 11,305 $ 11,284\nOperating profit as a % of revenue 24.6 % 22.5 % 27.4 % 26.7 %\nNorth America revenues decreased by $586,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from the three months ended September 30, 2023.

We also had $675,000 in restricted cash held in the\nU.S. as of September 30, 2024.\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased $4.3 million from $16.4 million as of December 31, 2023 to $12.1 million as of September 30, 2024\nprimarily due to $16.6 million cash used to repurchase common stock, offset partially by $13.3 million cash provided by operating activities.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had merchant payables of $17.3 million related to unredeemed vouchers. In the Company’s financial statements presented\nin this 10-Q report, following U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we classified all merchant payables as current. When all merchant\npayables are classified as current, there is negative net working capital (which is defined as current assets minus current liabilities) of $7.0 million. Payables to\nmerchants are generally due upon redemption of vouchers. The vouchers expire between October 2024 through December 2025; however, these expiration\ndates may sometimes be extended on a case-by-case basis and final payment upon expiration may not be due for up to a year after expiration. Based on current\nprojections of redemption activity, we expect that cash on hand as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to provide for working capital needs for at least the\nnext twelve months.\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 13,257 $ 9,293\nNet cash used in investing activities (129) (104)\nNet cash used in financing activities (17,197) (12,065)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (214) 80\nNet decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (4,283) $ (2,796)\nNet cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.

Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted\nof $1.2 million for stock-based compensation and $737,000 for depreciation and amortization. The increase in cash from changes in operating assets and\nliabilities was primarily due to $1.8 million increase in deferred revenue, $1.4 million increase in other non-current liabilities and $802,000 increase in\naccounts payable and accrued expenses, offset partially by $3.3 million decrease in merchant payables.\n37\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $9.3 million, which primarily consisted of net income of\n$8.7 million and $1.6 million increase in non-cash items, offset partially by $1.1 million decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nAdjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $1.4 million for depreciation and amortization and $1.2 million for stock-based compensation, offset\npartially by $944,000 reversal of reserves from accounts receivable and other.

The cash used in\ninvesting activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was consisted of purchases of property and equipment. The cash used in investing activities\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily consisted of the $217,000 purchases of property and equipment, offset partially by $113,000\nproceeds from repayment of the Japan loan.\nNet cash used for financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $17.2 million which primarily consisted of the repurchase of\ncommon stock of $16.6 million and taxes paid for net share settlement of $592,000. Net cash used for financing activities for the nine months ended September\n30, 2023 was $12.1 million which primarily consisted of the repurchase of common stock of $11.8 million and taxes paid for net share settlement of $299,000.\nConsistent with our growth, we experienced fluctuations in our cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses, product development expenses and\ngeneral and administrative expenses, and we anticipate that these increases will continue for the foreseeable future. We believe cash on hand will be sufficient\nto pay such costs for at least the next twelve months. In addition, we will continue to evaluate possible investments in businesses, products and technologies,\nthe consummation of any of which would increase our capital requirements.\nAlthough we currently believe we have sufficient capital resources to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at\nleast the next twelve months, unanticipated events and opportunities or a less favorable than expected development of our business with one or more\nadvertising formats may require us to sell additional equity or debt securities or establish credit facilities to raise capital in order to meet our capital\nrequirements.\nIf we sell additional equity or convertible debt securities, such sale could dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders. If we issue debt securities or\nestablish a new credit facility, our fixed obligations could increase and we may be required to agree to operating covenants that would restrict our operations.\nWe cannot be sure that any such financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us.\nIf the development of our business is less favorable than expected, we may decide to significantly reduce the size of our operations and marketing\nexpenses in certain markets with the objective of reducing cash outflows.\nThe information set forth under “Note 4—Commitments and Contingencies” and “Note 10—Leases” to the accompanying condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements included in this report.

See “Note 5: Income Taxes” to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because they\nrequire that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nNot required for smaller reporting companies.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nBased on management’s evaluation (with the participation of the Company’s Global Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Accounting Officer\n(CAO), as of September 30, 2024, our CEO and CAO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), are not effective due to the material weakness in internal control over financial\nreporting noted below to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act\nis recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in U.S. SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and\ncommunicated to management, including our CEO and CAO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nHowever, after giving full consideration to the material weakness, management, including our CEO and CAO, that our condensed consolidated financial\nstatements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of our operations and our cash flows for the periods presented in this Quarterly\nReport, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nMaterial Weakness\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to having sufficient resources for the accounting for certain non-\nroutine, non-recurring, unusual or complex transactions within our financial statement closing and reporting process. Specifically, the Company did not have\ninternal financial staff with sufficient specific expertise to ensure complete and timely financial reporting and disclosures related to technical and complex\naccounting transactions.\nRemediation Plan\nWe have made progress towards remediation and continue to implement our remediation plan for the material weakness in internal control over financial\nreporting described above. Specifically, we realigned certain of our personnel (including promoting a Chief Accounting Officer and recruiting for additional\nheadcount in Finance), improved reporting processes, and designed and implemented new controls in preparation for the next non-routine, non-recurring,\nunusual or complex transaction. We will engage sufficient outside subject matter experts and specialists to ensure the complete and timely accounting and\nfinancial reporting for certain non-routine, unusual or complex transactions and technical matters, where appropriate. We are committed to maintaining a strong\ninternal control environment and implementing measures designed to help ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated\nas soon as possible. We will consider the material weakness remediated after the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nAs outlined above, we are in the process of taking steps to remediate the material weakness previously reported related to non-routine, non-recurring,\nunusual or complex transactions. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we made no other changes in internal control over financial reporting (as\ndefined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\n40\nPART II—OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.
