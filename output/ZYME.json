Zymeworks’ mission is to make a meaningful difference in the lives of people impacted by difficult-to-treat cancers and other diseases. The Company’s complementary therapeutic platforms and fully integrated drug development engine provide the flexibility and compatibility to precisely engineer and develop highly differentiated antibody-based therapeutic candidates. Zymeworks engineered and developed zanidatamab, a HER2-targeted bispecific antibody using the Company’s proprietary Azymetric™ technology. Zymeworks has entered into separate agreements with BeiGene, Ltd. (BeiGene) and Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited (Jazz), granting each exclusive rights to develop and commercialize zanidatamab in different territories. Zanidatamab is currently being evaluated in multiple global clinical trials as a potential best-in-class treatment for patients with HER2-expressing cancers. The U.S. FDA granted accelerated approval of Ziihera® (zanidatamab-hrii) 50mg/mL for injection for intravenous use for the treatment of adults with previously-treated, unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive (IHC 3+) biliary tract cancer (BTC). Ziihera is the first and only dual HER2-targeted bispecific antibody approved for HER2-positive BTC in the U.S. A BLA has also been accepted for review by the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China. Zymeworks is rapidly advancing a robust pipeline of wholly-owned product candidates, leveraging its expertise in both antibody-drug conjugates and multispecific antibody therapeutics targeting novel pathways in areas of significant unmet medical need. Phase 1 studies for ZW171 and ZW191 are now actively recruiting with investigational new drug applications for ZW220 and ZW251 planned for 2025. In addition to Zymeworks’ pipeline, its therapeutic platforms have been further leveraged through strategic partnerships with global biopharmaceutical companies.

Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.1 The approval of _Ziihera,_ which previously received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for this indication, is an important advance and offers the first and only dual HER2-targeted bispecific antibody and chemotherapy-free treatment for patients living with BTC.\n\nIn late 2022, Zymeworks entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited (a subsidiary of Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc, collectively referred to as Jazz), for the exclusive development and commercialization rights to zanidatamab across all indications in the United States, Europe, Japan and all other territories except for those Asia Pacific territories previously licensed by Zymeworks. This collaboration allowed the Company to leverage Jazz’s global commercial infrastructure, together with BeiGene’s complementary strengths in certain Asia Pacific countries, to enable the global, rapid advancement of zanidatamab in multiple tumor types with the potential to provide a foundational HER2-targeted therapy for patients with difficult-to-treat cancers and limited treatment options. Under the terms of the Jazz license and collaboration agreement, Zymeworks has earned a milestone payment of $25M based on the FDA approval in BTC. Zymeworks is also eligible to receive up to a further $500M in regulatory milestone payments and $862.5M in commercial milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties of 10% to 20% of net sales by Jazz.\n\nThis approval represents the first FDA-approved therapy in Zymeworks’ pipeline, and validates the Company’s novel Azymetric™ bispecific platform technology and internal research and development capabilities for novel multifunctional medicines.\n\n“The FDA’s accelerated approval of _Ziihera_ marks the culmination of more than a decade of research and development at Zymeworks, highlighting our deep scientific expertise in multifunctional biotherapeutics and unwavering commitment to innovation in drug development,” said Paul Moore, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer at Zymeworks. “This approval exemplifies our team’s exceptional scientific capabilities to translate from an initial hypothesis for dual-HER2 blockade to a breakthrough treatment that offers new hope for patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive BTC with limited treatment options and few approved therapies.”\n\nThrough rigorous scientific investigation, innovative protein engineering, and proprietary Azymetric™ bispecific platform technology, Zymeworks developed the unique binding mechanism of zanidatamab-hrii, which enables it to bind to two extracellular sites on HER2. Binding of zanidatamab-hrii with HER2 results in internalization leading to a reduction of the receptor on the tumor cell surface. Zanidatamab-hrii induces complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). These mechanisms result in tumor growth inhibition and cell death in vitro and in vivo.\n\nThe FDA approval of _Ziihera_ is based on compelling data from the HERIZON-BTC-01 trial, which included the evaluation of zanidatamab as a single agent in previously treated HER2-positive (as determined by Roche Diagnostic’s PATHWAY® anti-HER-2/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody companion diagnostic) BTC and is the largest Phase 2b clinical trial to date specifically for this patient population. The trial achieved its primary endpoint of confirmed objective response rate (cORR) by independent central review (ICR) and results were presented at the [American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting 2023](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=6nudYJInoUXdO1mARuCEUN9urdEZ_HP2m9DL3PtDozVf0Jv9TLlwSHygDVajSv3HpSXd7T-dNqIouwuXZ2H9ztUPKJ2UQqvo0XRW3x2gO9sJNjjYVGyPfBqfC7hvtRTaY31Oz4e-D9wW8EjOyRHRs0x_uhW8467YyHVUM-p55UualFues7OhzTkEcQIs6ldo3tpZL7xjXIMszJoYUbkSHSLw27CFvPOTUW0a60xv4MJ4txXTXOtheCaSdjbQhS8mwIJfmCLgEjPvdJcqRHzMHWbCtNArdfs7tk7d7AIV4HQ=), published in [_The Lancet Oncology_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=di82CIf0MHQr1crcRhmqVh8sn2U25uoiXo9YOTAQJRed2-AHAAIFqhm84V5RReX0KEdKKq3UtsY_RcOy9Mz2XQhl5Ocr_tL_YJiTSTZbuxx4eG-02WMSN9FMCj7bsWNvNkYIxBHKQ2rLPV57KnZqGASlBgpquTnbh8qbtJZ2d_s=) _,_ and included in the 2023 Best of ASCO® program _._ Longer follow-up data showing improvement upon previously reported DOR were reported at the [ASCO Annual Meeting 2024](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=GsXoeZfaeLzw_fu2aCFdWqo66R_Y2DC9KGLsnXmUyl8VQ_X8WeDkJjoJTm6Y4hk19WGTkCKhKqYy4oPx078DxUloT4FxYZjeWiqTsd9dyOAZODanKHvI15LChg4HdoUiGNxfT5lu66MxQopsDC7LifBi1yZrwQB6V0p9C5u2g9SEjrSInoFaFaQqUCpLF7a3KXAE7ERubw4E0dcUskQLn59gaSWrOmAP82a9SrEW1QoNePoIoW9vXdQc9D1tdEb8).1 \n\nThe Phase 3 HERIZON-BTC-302 confirmatory trial is ongoing to evaluate zanidatamab in combination with standard-of-care therapy versus standard-of-care therapy alone in the first-line setting for patients with HER2-positive BTC. Zanidatamab is also being investigated in a number of additional tumor types, including Phase 3 trials in gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas (GEAs) and metastatic breast cancer (mBC). The HERIZON-GEA-01 trial is evaluating the potential of zanidatamab plus chemotherapy with or without tislelizumab as first-line treatment for patients with advanced/metastatic HER2-positive GEAs and top-line progression-free survival data from this study is expected to be available in Q2-2025. The EmpowHER-303 trial is evaluating the potential of zanidatamab in combination with physician’s choice chemotherapy for the treatment of HER2-positive mBC for patients who have progressed on, or are intolerant to, previous trastuzumab deruxtecan treatment.\n\n“Our strategic collaboration with Jazz provided the optimal ‘partner of choice’ to continue the rapid advancement of zanidatamab, and we are extremely encouraged with Jazz’s continued investment in and dedication to the development and commercialization of this novel therapy within their geographic territories,” said Kenneth Galbraith, Chair and Chief Executive Officer of Zymeworks. “The combination of our strong balance sheet and anticipated revenue stream associated with zanidatamab positions us to accelerate the development of our wholly-owned R&D programs, while maintaining our projected cash runway into the second half of 2027.”\n\nZymeworks continues to advance a diverse pipeline of novel therapeutics targeting difficult-to-treat cancers and other serious diseases, with several product candidates in various stages of development. The Company’s in-house research and development capabilities, which were instrumental in zanidatamab’s success, remain focused on delivering the next generation of innovative treatments. Zymeworks will host an in-person and virtual R&D day in New York on December 12, 2024, which will feature updates on the Company’s portfolio of solid tumor targeting antibody-drug conjugates and T cell engager molecules, including preclinical progress supporting potential investigational new drug applications for multiple new product candidates in 2025, 2026 and beyond, and strategy and rationale for potential expansion into new therapeutic areas in hematological cancers and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.\n\nMore information about _Ziihera_ , the Full Prescribing Information, including Boxed Warning and Patient Information, is available [here.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=bQf_VIjsE8QmrLQ2CNgD-SRfT-CoFH5m4XWd-jCrfqbEN4wLFDRntCRyr7VFKrjCtP4kqnnoGRGZxcGQ7EBCivr1ASyxlKUU1-jkS2kA3Fw=)\n\n**About Ziihera****®****(zanidatamab-hrii)**\n\n_Ziihera_ (zanidatamab-hrii) is a bispecific HER2-directed antibody that binds to two extracellular sites on HER2. Binding of zanidatamab-hrii with HER2 results in internalization leading to a reduction of the receptor on the tumor cell surface. Zanidatamab-hrii induces complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). These mechanisms result in tumor growth inhibition and cell death in vitro and in vivo.1 In the United States, _Ziihera_ is indicated for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive (IHC 3+) biliary tract cancer (BTC), as detected by an FDA-approved test.1 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for this indication based on overall response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).1\n\nZanidatamab is not approved anywhere else in the world.\n\nZanidatamab is being developed in multiple clinical trials as a targeted treatment option for patients with solid tumors that express HER2. Zanidatamab is being developed by Jazz and BeiGene, Ltd. (BeiGene) under license agreements from Zymeworks, which first developed the molecule.\n\nThe FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for zanidatamab development in patients with previously treated HER2 gene-amplified BTC, and two Fast Track designations for zanidatamab: one as a single agent for refractory BTC and one in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy for 1L gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA). Additionally, zanidatamab has received Orphan Drug designations from FDA for the treatment of BTC and GEA, as well as Orphan Drug designation from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of BTC and gastric cancer.\n\nMore information about _Ziihera_ , the Full Prescribing Information, including Boxed Warning and Patient Information, is available [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=r66oO6CtlVWMZkWXcmzLFb58QAo_kn0ARvePTzBrowdMNr2X4NI1MjmAikKlw8-DzUYT7gTNMGH6H80TujLt_oe7TvGLGiZFI1dQpvqyE44=).\n\n**Important Safety Information**\n\n**WARNING: EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY****Exposure to ZIIHERA during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise patients of the risk and need for effective contraception.**  \n---  \n  \n**WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS**\n\n**Embryo-Fetal Toxicity** ZIIHERA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In literature reports, use of a HER2-directed antibody during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death.\n\nVerify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ZIIHERA. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that exposure to ZIIHERA during pregnancy or within 4 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm.Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ZIIHERA and for 4 months following the last dose of ZIIHERA.\n\n**Left Ventricular Dysfunction**\n\nZIIHERA can cause decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). LVEF declined by >10% and decreased to <50% in 4.3% of 233 patients. Left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) leading to permanent discontinuation of ZIIHERA was reported in 0.9% of patients. The median time to first occurrence of LVD was 5.6 months (range: 1.6 to 18.7). LVD resolved in 70% of patients.\n\nAssess LVEF prior to initiation of ZIIHERA and at regular intervals during treatment. Withhold dose or permanently discontinue ZIIHERA based on severity of adverse reactions.\n\nThe safety of ZIIHERA has not been established in patients with a baseline ejection fraction that is below 50%.\n\n**Infusion-Related Reactions**\n\nZIIHERA can cause infusion-related reactions (IRRs). An IRR was reported in 31% of 233 patients treated with ZIIHERA as a single agent in clinical studies, including Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (25%). IRRs leading to permanent discontinuation of ZIIHERA were reported in 0.4% of patients. IRRs occurred on the first day of dosing in 28% of patients; 97% of IRRs resolved within one day.\n\nPrior to each dose of ZIIHERA, administer premedications to prevent potential IRRs. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of IRR during ZIIHERA administration and as clinically indicated after completion of infusion. Have medications and emergency equipment to treat IRRs available for immediate use.\n\nIf an IRR occurs, slow, or stop the infusion, and administer appropriate medical management. Monitor patients until complete resolution of signs and symptoms before resuming. Permanently discontinue ZIIHERA in patients with recurrent severe or life-threatening IRRs.\n\n**Diarrhea**\n\nZIIHERA can cause severe diarrhea.\n\nDiarrhea was reported in 48% of 233 patients treated in clinical studies, including Grade 3 (6%) and Grade 2 (17%). If diarrhea occurs, administer antidiarrheal treatment as clinically indicated. Perform diagnostic tests as clinically indicated to exclude other causes of diarrhea. Withhold or permanently discontinue ZIIHERA based on severity.\n\n**ADVERSE REACTIONS**\n\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 53% of 80 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive BTC who received ZIIHERA. Serious adverse reactions in >2% of patients included biliary obstruction (15%), biliary tract infection (8%), sepsis (8%), pneumonia (5%), diarrhea (3.8%), gastric obstruction (3.8%), and fatigue (2.5%). A fatal adverse reaction of hepatic failure occurred in one patient who received ZIIHERA.The most common adverse reactions in 80 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive BTC who received ZIIHERA (≥20%) were diarrhea (50%), infusion-related reaction (35%), abdominal pain (29%), and fatigue (24%).\n\n**USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS**\n\n**Pediatric Use**\n\nSafety and efficacy of ZIIHERA have not been established in pediatric patients.\n\n**Geriatric Use**\n\nOf the 80 patients who received ZIIHERA for unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive BTC, there were 39 (49%) patients 65 years of age and older. Thirty-seven (46%) were aged 65-74 years old and 2 (3%) were aged 75 years or older.\n\nNo overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between these patients and younger adult patients.\n\n**About Biliary Tract Cancer**\n\nBTC, including gallbladder cancer and intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, account for <1% of all adult cancers globally and are often associated with a poor prognosis.2,3 The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a well-validated target for antitumor therapy in other cancers. Across the U.S., Europe, and Japan, approximately 12,000 people are diagnosed with HER2+ BTC annually.4,5,6,7\n\n**About Azymetric™**\n\nAzymetric™ is a heterodimeric antibody technology that gives the ability to engineer, screen, and effectively choose the optimal geometry and valency for our targeted treatments. These customized therapeutic antibodies are engineered to simultaneously bind to multiple distinct locations on a target or to multiple targets, resulting in unique mechanisms of action not accessible through typical monospecific antibodies. Azymetric™ antibodies can block multiple signaling pathways, recruit immune cells to tumors, enhance receptor clustering and internalization, and increase tumor-specific targeting. Zymeworks’ other technologies can combine with Azymetric™ to engineer the antibody backbone of a bispecific antibody-drug conjugate or the base of a multispecific therapeutic, to overcome known therapeutic barriers and help design potential best-in-class bi-specifics and trispecifics.\n\n**About Zymeworks Inc. **\n\nZymeworks is a global clinical-stage biotechnology company committed to the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel, multifunctional biotherapeutics.

(Nasdaq: ZYME), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a diverse pipeline of novel, multifunctional biotherapeutics to improve the standard of care for difficult-to-treat diseases, today announced that the first patient has been dosed in the company’s first-in-human Phase 1 trial ([NCT06555744](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=aHp-cuqHnmx8fC7lx89j8ZNJGMRAt_6zpxNTIBa9WLT2Pxo3_LUFvwDbbRLrv5itaRID_CNIJb4BLuhre6p5HfousB7RwUh-1SbW9cMtgjs=)) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the investigational therapy ZW191 in the treatment of advanced folate receptor-⍺ (FR⍺)-expressing solid tumors including ovarian, endometrial, and non-small cell lung (NSCLC) cancers.\n\n“Our team is excited to initiate this important clinical trial to assess the safety and tolerability of ZW191, our first antibody-drug conjugate utilizing ZD06519, our novel proprietary payload, in patients with difficult-to-treat cancers,” said Jeff Smith, M.D., FRCP, Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer at Zymeworks. “This global study represents a significant milestone in our mission to bring innovative and urgently needed therapies to patients in need. This announcement also follows the recent initiation of our Phase 1 trial of ZW171, marking an additional important step forward in advancing the many promising therapies in our wholly-owned pipeline.”\n\nFRα is found in ~75% of high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas1 and ~70% of lung adenocarcinomas2. In data presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting in 2024, ZW191 was associated with greater anti-tumor activity compared to benchmark in FRα-expressing tumor models and was well-tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys up to 60 mg/kg3.\n\nThe Phase 1 trial is a two-part, multi-center, global study that aims to enroll 145 adult patients with advanced FR⍺-expressing cancers. The Company expects to enroll patients at investigator sites in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. Part one of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of ZW191 and involve dose escalation in patients with advanced ovarian, endometrial, and NSCLC cancers, with secondary endpoints assessing pharmacokinetics and confirmed objective response rate. Part two of the study will further evaluate safety and explore the potential anti-tumor activity of ZW191.\n\n**About ZW191** ZW191 is an antibody-drug conjugate that is engineered to target a protein called folate receptor-⍺ (FR⍺) that is found on the surface of a variety of tumors such as on ovarian, endometrial, and lung cancers. ZW191’s differentiated design strongly supports its ability to internalize into FR⍺-expressing cells with the potential to release bystander active topoisomerase-1 inhibitor (ZD06519), a novel proprietary payload developed by Zymeworks to kill tumor cells.\n\n**About Zymeworks Inc.**\n\nZymeworks is a global clinical-stage biotechnology company committed to the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel, multifunctional biotherapeutics. Zymeworks’ mission is to make a meaningful difference in the lives of people impacted by difficult-to-treat cancers and other diseases. The Company’s complementary therapeutic platforms and fully integrated drug development engine provide the flexibility and compatibility to precisely engineer and develop highly differentiated antibody-based therapeutic candidates. Zymeworks engineered and developed zanidatamab, a HER2-targeted bispecific antibody using the Company’s proprietary Azymetric™ technology. Zymeworks has entered into separate agreements with BeiGene, Ltd. (BeiGene) and Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited (Jazz), granting each exclusive rights to develop and commercialize zanidatamab in different territories. Zanidatamab is currently being evaluated in multiple global clinical trials as a potential best-in-class treatment for patients with HER2-expressing cancers. A Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking accelerated approval for zanidatamab as a treatment for previously treated, unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic HER2-positive biliary tract cancer (BTC) has been accepted and granted Priority Review. A BLA has also been accepted for review by the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China. If approved, zanidatamab would be the first HER2-targeted treatment specifically approved for BTC in the U.S. and China. Zymeworks is rapidly advancing a robust pipeline of wholly-owned product candidates, leveraging its expertise in both antibody-drug conjugates and multispecific antibody therapeutics targeting novel pathways in areas of significant unmet medical need. Phase 1 studies for ZW171 and ZW191 are now actively recruiting. In addition to Zymeworks’ pipeline, its therapeutic platforms have been further leveraged through strategic partnerships with global biopharmaceutical companies.
