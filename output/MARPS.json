          "content": "Marine Petroleum Trust\nMARINE PETROLEUM TRUST\nANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER CASH DISTRIBUTION\nDALLAS, Texas, November 18, 2024 – Marine Petroleum Trust (NASDAQ:\nMARPS) (“Marine”) today declared a quarterly cash distribution to the holders of its units of\nbeneficial interest of $0.102923 per unit, payable on December 30, 2024, to unitholders of\nrecord on November 29, 2024. Marine’s 2023 tax information, cash distribution history,\ncurrent and prior year financial reports, a link to filings made with the Securities and\nExchange Commission and more can be found on its website at http://www.marps-\nmarine.com/. Additionally, printed reports can be requested and are mailed free of charge.\nThis distribution of $0.102923 per unit is higher than the $0.094886 per unit\ndistributed last quarter. Volumes of both oil and natural gas produced and prices realized\nfor oil included in this distribution have increased, while natural gas pricing has decreased\nwhen compared to last quarter. This distribution is higher than the $0.083661 per unit\ndistributed in the comparable quarter in 2023. As compared to the comparable quarter in\n2023, the volume of oil produced decreased this year while production for natural gas\nincreased. As compared to the comparable quarter in 2023, the price realized for both oil\nand natural gas have increased.\nMarine’s distributions to unitholders are determined by royalties received up to the\ndate the distribution amount is declared. In general, Marine receives royalties two months\nafter oil production and three months after natural gas production.\n* * *\nContact: Jana Egeler\nVP, Royalty Trust Services\nArgent Trust Company, Trustee\nToll Free – 1.855.588-7839"

Accounting Policies\nThe financial statements herein include the financial statements of Marine Petroleum Trust (the “Trust”) and its wholly owned subsidiary,\nMarine Petroleum Corporation (“MPC,” and collectively with the Trust, “Marine”). The financial statements are condensed and consolidated and should\nbe read in conjunction with Marine’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. The financial statements included herein are\nunaudited, but in the opinion of Argent Trust Company (the “Trustee”), the Trustee of the Trust, they include all adjustments necessary for a fair\npresentation of the results of operations for the periods presented. Operating results for the interim periods reported herein are not necessarily indicative\nof the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024.\nNote 2. Basis of Accounting\nThe financial statements of Marine are prepared on the modified cash basis method and are not intended to present Marine’s financial\nposition and results of operations in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Under the modified cash\nbasis method the financial statements of Marine differ from financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP because of the following:\n• Royalty income is recognized in the month when received by Marine rather than in the month of production.\n• Marine’s expenses (including accounting, legal, other professional fees, trustees’ fees and out-of-pocket expenses) are recorded on an\nactual paid basis in the month paid rather than in the month incurred. Reserves for liabilities that are contingent or uncertain in amount\nmay also be established if considered necessary, which would not be recorded under GAAP.\n• At the time the Trust was established, no determinable market value was available for the assets transferred to the Trust; consequently,\nnominal values were assigned. Accordingly, no allowance for depletion has been included. All income from oil and natural gas royalties\nrelate to proved developed oil and natural gas reserves.\nThe modified cash basis method of accounting corresponds to the accounting principles permitted for royalty trusts by the U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E, Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts. Because the\nTrust’s financial statements are prepared on the modified cash basis, as described above, most accounting pronouncements are not applicable to or do\nnot have a significant impact on the Trust’s financial statements.\nNote 3. Distributable Income\nThe Trust’s Indenture (the “Indenture”) provides that the Trustee is to distribute all cash in the Trust, less an amount reserved for payment\nof accrued liabilities and estimated future expenses, to unitholders of record on the 28th day of March, June, September and December of each year. If\nthe 28th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the payments are to be made on the immediately succeeding business day. Total estimated\nreserve for future expenses deducted from calculated distributable income for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $120,500.\nAs stated under “Note 1. Accounting Policies” above, the financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are the condensed\nand consolidated financial statements of the Trust and MPC. However, distributable income is paid from the account balances of the Trust. Distributable\nincome is comprised of (i) royalties from offshore Texas leases owned directly by the Trust, (ii) 98% of the royalties received from offshore Louisiana\nleases owned by MPC, which are retained by and delivered to the Trust on a quarterly basis, (iii) cash distributions from the Trust’s interest in Tidelands\nRoyalty Trust “B” (“Tidelands”), a separate royalty trust, until Tidelands was wound up, (iv) dividends paid by MPC, less (v) administrative expenses\nincurred by the Trust. Distributions fluctuate from quarter to quarter primarily due to changes in oil and natural gas prices and production quantities and\nexpenses incurred.\n5\nNote 4. Investment in Affiliate — Tidelands Royalty Trust “B”\nAt March 31, 2022, the Trust owned 32.6% of the outstanding units of beneficial interest in Tidelands, which entity was wound up prior to\nJune 30, 2022. Due to Tidelands being wound up prior to June 30, 2022, there was no market underlying the 452,366 units owned by the Trust at the\ntime Tidelands was wound up. A reserve of $123,193 has been established for future reporting and compliance issues that may arise in years to come\nand will be used for such transactions. Due to Tidelands being wound up prior to June 30, 2022, there was no income received for the three and six\nmonths ended December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.\nTidelands was a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. On March 8, 2019, Tidelands terminated the\nregistration of its units under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, and suspended its reporting obligations under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act. As of\nthat date, Tidelands’ obligations to file certain reports with the SEC, including annual, quarterly and current reports on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and\nForm 8-K, respectively, were automatically and immediately suspended. The last regular distribution Marine received from Tidelands was in the fourth\nquarter of 2018. The term of Tidelands expired in 2021. Tidelands has been wound up and declared January 31, 2022 as the record date for the final\ndistribution which was paid in February 2022.\nItem 2. Trustee’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOrganization\nMarine Petroleum Trust (the “Trust”) is a royalty trust that was created in 1956 under the laws of the State of Texas. Effective February 20,\n2018, Simmons Bank became corporate trustee of the Trust (“Simmons”) as a result of a merger between Simmons Bank and Southwest Bank, the\nformer corporate trustee of the Trust. On November 4, 2021, Simmons announced that it had entered into an agreement with Argent Trust Company, a\nTennessee chartered trust company (the “Trustee”), pursuant to which Simmons would resign as trustee of the Trust and nominate Argent Trust\nCompany as successor trustee of the Trust. The change in trustee from Simmons to Argent Trust Company was effective on December 30, 2022.\nThe Trust’s Indenture provides that the term of the Trust will expire on June 1, 2041, unless extended by the vote of the holders of a\nmajority of the outstanding units of beneficial interest.\nThe Trust is not permitted to engage in any business activity because it was organized for the sole purpose of providing an efficient,\norderly and practical means for the administration and liquidation of rights to payments from certain oil and natural gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico,\npursuant to license agreements and amendments between the Trust’s predecessors and Gulf Oil Corporation (“Gulf”). As a result of various transactions\nthat have occurred since 1956, these interests were largely held by Chevron Corporation (“Chevron”) and are now predominantly held by its assignees,\nincluding Arena Energy, LP (collectively with Chevron and its assignees, the “Interest Owners”). The Trust holds title to interests in properties that are\nsituated offshore of Texas.\nThe Trust’s wholly owned subsidiary, Marine Petroleum Corporation (“MPC,” and collectively with the Trust, “Marine”), holds title to\ninterests in properties that are situated offshore of Louisiana because at the time the Trust was created, trusts could not hold these interests under\nLouisiana law. MPC is prohibited from engaging in a trade or business and only takes those actions that are necessary for the administration and\nliquidation of its properties.\nMarine’s rights are generally referred to as overriding royalty interests in the oil and natural gas industry. An overriding royalty interest is\ncreated by an assignment by the owner of a working interest in an oil or natural gas lease. The royalty rights associated with an overriding royalty\ninterest terminate when the underlying lease terminates. All production and marketing functions are conducted by the working interest owners of the\nleases. Income from overriding royalties is paid to Marine either (i) on the basis of the selling price of oil, natural gas and other minerals produced,\nsaved or sold, or (ii) at the value at the wellhead as determined by industry standards, when the selling price does not reflect the value at the wellhead.\n6\nThe Trustee assumes that some units of beneficial interest are held by middlemen, as such term is broadly defined in U.S. Treasury\nRegulations (and includes custodians, nominees, certain joint owners and brokers holding an interest for a customer in street name). Therefore, the\nTrustee considers the Trust to be a widely held fixed investment trust (“WHFIT”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Trust will\nprovide tax information in accordance with applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations governing the information reporting requirements of the Trust as a\nWHFIT. The Trustee will provide the required information and the contact information for the Trustee is below:\nArgent Trust Company\n3838 Oak Lawn Avenue, Suite 1720\nDallas, Texas 75219\nTelephone number: (855) 588-7839\nEach unitholder should consult its own tax advisor for compliance with U.S. federal income tax laws and regulations.\nCommodity Prices\nThe Trust’s income and monthly distributions are heavily influenced by commodity prices. Commodity prices may fluctuate widely in response to\n(i) relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, (ii) market uncertainty and (iii) a variety of additional factors that are\nbeyond the Trustee’s control. Factors that may impact future commodity prices, including the price of oil and natural gas, include but are not limited to:\n• political conditions worldwide, and in particular, political disruptions, terrorist activities, wars or other armed conflicts in oil producing\nregions, including the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war;\n• worldwide economic conditions;\n• weather conditions;\n• trade barriers;\n• public health concerns;\n• the supply and price of domestic and foreign crude oil or natural gas;\n• the level of consumer demand;\n• the price and availability of alternative fuels;\n• the proximity to, and capacity of, transportation facilities;\n• the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures; and\n• the nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation.\nAlthough the Trustee cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect future commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will be\naffected, gas royalty income for a given period generally relates to production three months prior to the period and crude oil royalty income for a given\nperiod generally relates to production two months prior to the period and will generally approximate current market prices in the geographic region of\nthe production at the time of production. When crude oil and natural gas prices decline, the Trust is affected in two ways. First, distributable income\nfrom the Trust’s royalty properties is reduced. Second, exploration and development activity by operators on the Trust’s royalty properties may decline\nas some projects may become uneconomic and are either delayed or eliminated. It is impossible to predict future crude oil and natural gas price\nmovements, and this reduces the predictability of future cash distributions to unitholders.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs stated in the Indenture, there is no requirement for capital due to the limited purpose of the Trust. The Trust’s only obligation is to\ndistribute the distributable income that is actually collected to unitholders. As an administrator of oil and natural gas royalty interests, the Trust collects\nroyalties monthly, pays administrative expenses and disburses all net royalties that are collected to its unitholders each quarter, subject to the availability\nof distributable income on the distribution date after the payment of expenses.\n7\nThe Indenture (and MPC’s charter and by-laws) expressly prohibits the operation of any kind of trade or business. The Trust’s oil and\nnatural gas properties are depleting assets that are not being replaced due to the prohibition against investments. These restrictions, along with other\nfactors, allow the Trust to be treated as a grantor trust. As a grantor trust, all income and deductions for state and U.S. federal income tax purposes\ngenerally flow through to each individual unitholder. The State of Texas imposes a franchise tax, but the Trust does not believe that it is subject to the\nfranchise tax because at least 90% of its income is from passive sources. Please see Marine’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nJune 30, 2023 for further information. MPC is a taxable entity that pays state and U.S. federal income taxes and state franchise taxes. However, MPC’s\nincome specifically excludes 98% of the oil and natural gas royalties collected by MPC, which are retained by and delivered to the Trust because of the\nTrust’s net profits interest.\nThe Leases\nMarine relies on public records for information regarding drilling and workover operations. The public records available up to the date of\nthis report indicate that there was one new well completion made during the three months ended December 31, 2023 on leases in which Marine has an\ninterest. As of February 1, 2024, public records also indicated that there were no new wells in the process of being drilled or recompleted on other leases\nin which Marine has an interest.\nMarine holds an overriding royalty interest that is equal to three-fourths of one percent of the working interest and is calculated on the\nvalue at the well of any oil, natural gas or other minerals produced and sold from 55 leases covering 199,868 gross acres located in the Gulf of Mexico.\nMarine’s overriding royalty interest applies only to existing leases and does not apply to any new leases that the Interest Owners may acquire.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn accordance with the Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E, Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts, Marine uses the modified cash basis\nmethod of accounting. Under this accounting method, royalty income is recorded when received, and distributions to unitholders are recorded when\ndeclared by the Trustee of the Trust. Expenses of Marine (including accounting, legal, other professional fees, trustees’ fees and out-of-pocket expenses)\nare recorded on an actual paid basis. Marine also reports distributable income instead of net income under the modified cash basis method of accounting.\nCash reserves are permitted to be established by the Trustee for certain contingencies that would not be recorded under generally accepted accounting\nprinciples in the United States.\nMarine did not have any changes in its critical accounting policies or estimates during the three and six months ended December 31, 2023.\nPlease see Marine’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 for a detailed discussion of its critical accounting policies.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSince the Trust financial statements are prepared on a modified-cash basis, most accounting pronouncements are not applicable to the\nTrust. No new accounting pronouncements have been adopted or issued that would have a significant impact on Marine’s financial statements.\nGeneral\nMarine’s royalty income is derived from the oil and natural gas production activities of third parties. Marine’s royalty income fluctuates\nfrom period to period based upon factors beyond Marine’s control, including, without limitation, the number of productive wells drilled and maintained\non leases that are subject to Marine’s interest, the level of production over time from such wells and the prices at which the oil and natural gas from such\nwells are sold.\nImportant aspects of Marine’s operations are conducted by third parties. Marine’s royalty income is dependent on the operations of the\nworking interest owners of the leases on which Marine has an overriding royalty interest. The oil and natural gas companies that lease tracts subject to\nMarine’s interests are responsible for the production and sale of oil and natural gas and the calculation of royalty payments to Marine. The only\nobligation of the working interest owners to Marine is to make monthly overriding royalty payments that reflect Marine’s interest in the oil and natural\ngas sold. Marine’s distributions are processed and paid by its transfer agent, Equiniti Trust Company.\n8\nThe volume of oil and natural gas produced and the selling prices of such oil and natural gas are the primary factors in calculating\noverriding royalty payments. Production is affected by the natural production decline of the producing wells, the number of new wells drilled and the\nnumber of existing wells that are re-worked and placed back in production on the leases. Production from existing wells is anticipated to decrease in the\nfuture due to normal well depletion. The operators do not provide Marine with information regarding future drilling or re-working operations that could\nimpact the oil and natural gas production from the leases for which Marine has an overriding royalty interest.\nSummary of Operating Results\nDuring the six months ended December 31, 2023, the Trust realized approximately 99% of its royalty income from the sale of oil and\napproximately 1% of its royalty income from the sale of natural gas. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, the Trust realized approximately\n94% of its royalty income from the sale of oil and approximately 6% of its royalty income from the sale of natural gas. Royalty income includes\nroyalties from oil and natural gas received from producers.\nDistributable income per unit for the six months ended December 31, 2023 was $0.21 as compared to $0.45 for the comparable period in\n2022. Distributions per unit also amounted to approximately $0.21 per unit for the six months ended December 31, 2023, a decrease from distributions\nof $0.51 per unit for the comparable period in 2022.\nFor the six months ended December 31, 2023, oil production decreased to 7,041 barrels (bbls) from 9,499 bbls and natural gas production\ndecreased to 5,439 thousand cubic feet (mcf) from 7,738 mcf as compared to the comparable period in 2022. For the six months ended December 31,\n2023, the average price realized for oil decreased to $75.71 per bbl as compared to the price of $100.65 realized for the comparable period in 2022 and\nthe average price realized for natural gas (net of expenses) decreased to $1.31 per mcf as compared to the average price of $8.40 realized for the\ncomparable period in 2022.\nThe following table presents the net production quantities of oil and natural gas and distributable income and distributions per unit for the\nlast six quarters.\nNet Production\nQuantities\nNatural Distributable Distributions\nQuarter Ended Oil (bbls) Gas (mcf) Income Per Unit Per Unit\nSeptember 30, 2022 5,187 4,417 $ 0.26 $ 0.26\nDecember 31, 2022 4,311 3,321 $ 0.19 $ 0.24\nMarch 31, 2023 3,390 1,914 $ 0.11 $ 0.16\nJune 30, 2023 3,929 3,060 $ 0.13 $ 0.11\nSeptember 30, 2023 3,964 3,148 $ 0.11 $ 0.12\nDecember 31, 2023 3,077 2,291 $ 0.10 $ 0.08\nResults of Operations—Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to the Three Months Ended December 31, 2022\nIncome from oil and natural gas royalties decreased to $249,200 during the three months ended December 31, 2023 from $425,321\nrealized for the comparable period in 2022.

This report uses the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “budget,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,”\n“plan,” or other similar words to identify forward-looking statements. You should read statements that contain these words carefully because they\ndiscuss future expectations, contain projections of Marine’s financial condition, and/or state other “forward-looking” information. Actual results may\ndiffer from expected results because of: reductions in price or demand for oil and natural gas, which might then lead to decreased production or impair\nMarine’s ability to make distributions; the impact of COVID-19 on future production and distributions; reductions in production due to the depletion of\nexisting wells or disruptions in service, which may be caused by storm damage to production facilities, blowouts or other production accidents, or\ngeological changes such as cratering of productive formations; changes in regulations; general economic conditions; actions and policies of petroleum-\nproducing nations; other changes in domestic and international energy markets; the resignation of the Trustee; and the expiration, termination or release\nof leases subject to Marine’s interests. Additional risks are set forth in Marine’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.\nEvents may occur in the future that Marine is unable to accurately predict or over which it has no control. If one or more of these uncertainties\nmaterialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those forward-looking statements included in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as required by applicable securities laws, Marine does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any\nforward-looking statements.\nWebsite\nMarine makes available, free of charge, its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form\n8-K, and amendments to such reports at its website at www.marps-marine.com. Each of these reports will be posted on this website as soon as\nreasonably practicable after such report is electronically filed with, or furnished, to the SEC.\nItem 3.

Marine’s disclosure controls and procedures include controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to\nbe disclosed by Marine in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to\nensure that information required to be disclosed by Marine in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to the Trustee as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Trustee carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Marine’s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act.
