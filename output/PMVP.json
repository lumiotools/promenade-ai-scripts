(Nasdaq: PMVP), a precision oncology company pioneering the discovery and development of small molecule, tumor-agnostic therapies targeting p53, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a corporate update.\n\n“The Phase 2 portion of the PYNNACLE trial continues to advance, with site activation and enrollment progressing well,” said David Mack, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of PMV Pharma. “We look forward to providing an update on the PYNNACLE clinical trial in the middle of next year.”\n\n**PYNNACLE Phase 2 Monotherapy Update**\n\nEnrollment is on track in the Phase 2 monotherapy portion of the PYNNACLE clinical trial. The multicenter, single-arm, registrational, tumor-agnostic Phase 2 trial is assessing rezatapopt as monotherapy at a dose of 2000 mg once-daily in patients with _TP53_ Y220C and _KRAS_ wild-type advanced solid tumors. The primary endpoint is overall response rate per blinded independent central review. The trial is designed to enroll 114 patients across five cohorts at approximately 60 sites.\n\nSite activation is progressing well, with more than 75% of sites activated across the U.S., Europe, and Asia-Pacific. PMV Pharma plans to provide data from the interim analysis of the Phase 2 monotherapy portion of the PYNNACLE trial by mid-2025 and anticipates a New Drug Application filing by the end of 2026.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Corporate Highlights:**\n\n  * PMV Pharma is collaborating with MD Anderson Cancer Center and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to support an investigator-initiated Phase 1b study. The study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of rezatapopt monotherapy and in combination with azacitidine in approximately 25 patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) harboring a _TP53 Y220C_ mutation. Enrollment is planned to begin in the first quarter of 2025.\n  * Rezatapopt food effect data were presented on September 8, 2024 during a poster session at the American College of Clinical Pharmacology Annual Conference. Key data are summarized below: \n    * In the Phase 1 portion of the PYNNACLE study, 13 patients received rezatapopt in a fasted state, while 12 patients received rezatapopt after eating. When taken with food, exposure levels at steady state as measured by AUC0-24 and Cmax increased by 42% and 40%, respectively. Additionally, variability in exposure decreased significantly with food.\n    * Overall, rezatapopt was well-tolerated and associated with fewer gastrointestinal (GI) treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) when administered with food. In addition, the frequency and severity of GI TRAEs were lowest in the 2000 mg once-daily (QD) fed cohort versus higher dose cohorts. These data supported the 2000 mg QD dose being recommended to be taken with food within the ongoing PYNNACLE Phase 2 study.\n  * Dose-limiting toxicities were observed in the combination arm of the Phase 1b PYNNACLE trial evaluating rezatapopt and Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab). As a result, rezatapopt 500 mg once-daily in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg every three weeks was established as the maximum tolerated dose. Due to limited clinical benefit at this dose, PMV Pharma discontinued enrollment in the Phase 1b combination arm.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nPMV Pharma ended the third quarter with $197.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, compared to $238.1 million as of September 30, 2023. Net cash used in operations was $34.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $43.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n  * Net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $19.2 million compared to $16.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The net loss increase was a result of increased research and development (R&D) spending associated with advancing our lead product candidate through the PYNNACLE Phase 1/2 clinical trial.\n  * R&D expenses were $16.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $13.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily related to increased contract research organization costs.\n  * General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $4.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $6.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in G&A expenses was primarily due to reduced spend for facility and operational expenses.\n\n\n\nKEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA.\n\n**About****Rezatapopt**\n\nRezatapopt (PC14586) is a first-in-class, small molecule p53 reactivator designed to selectively bind to the pocket in the p53 Y220C mutant protein, restoring the wild-type tumor-suppressor function. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation to rezatapopt for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with a TP53 Y220C mutation.\n\n**About the PYNNACLE Clinical Trial**\n\nThe ongoing Phase 1/2 PYNNACLE clinical trial is evaluating rezatapopt in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring a TP53 Y220C mutation. The primary objective of the Phase 1 portion of the trial was to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of rezatapopt when administered orally to patients. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and effects on biomarkers were also assessed. In Phase 1, an overall response rate of 38% (6/16 evaluable patients) was achieved at the RP2D of 2000 mg daily reflective of the Phase 2 patient population (TP53 Y220C and KRAS wild-type). The median duration of response was seven months. The Phase 2 monotherapy portion is a registrational, single-arm, expansion basket clinical trial comprising five cohorts (ovarian, lung, breast, endometrial cancers, and other solid tumors) with the primary objective of evaluating the efficacy of rezatapopt at the RP2D in patients with TP53 Y220C and KRAS wild-type advanced solid tumors.\n\nFor more information about the Phase 1/2 PYNNACLE clinical trial, refer to www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT trial identifier NCT04585750).\n\n**About PMV Pharma**\n\nPMV Pharma is a precision oncology company pioneering the discovery and development of small molecule, tumor-agnostic therapies targeting p53.

Nineteen patients were enrolled in the combination arm of the trial. This decision was driven by dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed at the 1000 mg dose of rezatapopt once-daily plus pembrolizumab 200 mg every three weeks. The DLTs were Grade 2 and 3 and included AST increase, platelet count decrease, pancreatitis, dehydration, and rash. No Grade 4 or 5 adverse events were observed. The safety profile of the rezatapopt and pembrolizumab combination has been consistent with each agent as monotherapy with no new safety signals observed.\n\nPer protocol, these observations established rezatapopt 500 mg once-daily in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg every three weeks as the maximum tolerated dose. Patients dosed with rezatapopt 500 mg once-daily in combination with pembrolizumab did not experience a clinically meaningful benefit, informing the decision to discontinue enrollment in the combination arm of the PYNNACLE trial.\n\n**MD Anderson Cancer Center and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to Initiate a Phase 1b Study in Recurrent/Refractory AML/MDS**\n\nPMV Pharma is collaborating with MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) to support an investigator-initiated Phase 1b study. The study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of rezatapopt monotherapy and in combination with azacitidine in approximately 25 patients with recurrent or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) harboring a _TP53 Y220C_ mutation. Enrollment is planned to begin in the first quarter of 2025 across two sites.\n\n“There is an important need for new treatment options for patients with recurrent or refractory AML or MDS harboring a TP53 Y220C mutation, as this mutation is often associated with poorer prognosis and resistance to conventional therapies” said Courtney DiNardo M.D., MSCE, Department of Leukemia, Division of Cancer Medicine at MDACC. “Based on proof-of-concept data demonstrating the ability of rezatapopt to selectively reactivate p53 in locally advanced/metastatic solid tumor patients with a TP53 Y220C mutation, we believe that rezatapopt in combination with azacitidine has the potential to significantly benefit this patient population.”\n\nEytan M. Stein, M.D., Chief, Leukemia Service at MSK commented, “Patients with p53 mutant AML currently have no effective standard of care treatment options that lead to long term survival, so this important trial using rezatapopt is the first step in developing a focused, mutation specific strategy, for this patient population.”\n\nDavid Mack, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of PMV Pharma commented, “While we are disappointed to discontinue enrollment of the trial evaluating rezatapopt in combination with pembrolizumab, we look forward to the initiation of the AML/MDS study and evaluating rezatapopt in other settings. I would like to thank the patients and investigators for their time and commitment to the Phase 1b combination portion of the PYNNACLE study. We remain excited by the potential for rezatapopt as a monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring a TP53 Y220C mutation and KRAS wild-type and look forward to providing interim data in the middle of next year.” \n\nKEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA.\n\n**About****Rezatapopt**\n\nRezatapopt (PC14586) is a first-in-class, small molecule p53 reactivator designed to selectively bind to the pocket in the p53 Y220C mutant protein, restoring the wild-type tumor-suppressor function. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation to rezatapopt for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with a TP53 Y220C mutation.\n\n**About the PYNNACLE Clinical Trial**\n\nThe ongoing Phase 1/2 PYNNACLE clinical trial is evaluating rezatapopt in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring a TP53 Y220C mutation. The primary objective of the Phase 1 portion of the trial was to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of rezatapopt when administered orally to patients. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and effects on biomarkers were also assessed. In Phase 1, an overall response rate of 38% (6/16 evaluable patients) was achieved at the RP2D of 2000 mg daily reflective of the Phase 2 patient population (TP53 Y220C and KRAS wild-type). The median duration of response was seven months. The Phase 2 monotherapy portion is a registrational, single-arm, expansion basket clinical trial comprising five cohorts (ovarian, lung, breast, endometrial cancers, and other solid tumors) with the primary objective of evaluating the efficacy of rezatapopt at the RP2D in patients with TP53 Y220C and KRAS wild-type advanced solid tumors.\n\nFor more information about the Phase 1/2 PYNNACLE clinical trial, refer to www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT trial identifier NCT04585750).\n\n**About PMV Pharma**\n\nPMV Pharma is a precision oncology company pioneering the discovery and development of small molecule, tumor-agnostic therapies targeting p53. TP53 mutations are found in approximately half of all cancers. Our co-founder, Dr. Arnold Levine, established the field of p53 biology when he discovered the p53 protein in 1979.

(Nasdaq: PMVP), a precision oncology company pioneering the discovery and development of small molecule, tumor-agnostic therapies targeting p53, today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024, and provided an update on the Phase 2 monotherapy and Phase 1b combination portions of the PYNNACLE clinical trial.\n\n“We are encouraged by the pace of site activation and patient enrollment in the Phase 2 PYNNACLE trial,” said David Mack, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of PMV Pharma. “I would like to thank our team for their continued execution, and we look forward to providing an update on the PYNNACLE clinical trial next year.”\n\n**PYNNACLE Phase 2 Monotherapy Update**\n\nEnrollment is on track in the Phase 2 monotherapy portion of the PYNNACLE clinical trial. The multicenter, single-arm, registrational, tumor-agnostic Phase 2 trial will assess rezatapopt as monotherapy at a dose of 2000 mg once-daily in patients with _TP53_ Y220C and _KRAS_ wild-type advanced solid tumors. The primary endpoint of the trial is overall response rate per blinded independent central review. The trial is designed to enroll 114 patients across five cohorts at approximately 60 sites.\n\nSite activation is progressing well, with more than 60% of sites activated across the U.S., Europe, and Asia-Pacific. PMV plans to provide data from the interim analysis of the Phase 2 monotherapy portion of the PYNNACLE trial by mid-2025 and anticipates a New Drug Application (NDA) filing by the end of 2026.\n\n**PYNNACLE Phase 1b Rezatapopt/Pembrolizumab Combination Update**\n\nEnrollment continues in the Phase 1b combination arm of the PYNNACLE trial evaluating rezatapopt in combination with pembrolizumab (200 mg every three weeks) in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring a _TP53_ Y220C mutation.\n\n  * Eight patients were initially enrolled at a dose of 1000 mg once-daily of rezatapopt and pembrolizumab. Three patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Subsequently, per protocol, eight patients were enrolled at 500 mg once-daily rezatapopt and pembrolizumab. As no DLTs were observed at this dose level, the Safety Review Committee escalated the rezatapopt dose to 1000 mg once-daily. Enrollment is currently ongoing at this dose level for rezatapopt. The pembrolizumab dose has remained at 200 mg every three weeks throughout the course of the Phase 1b combination clinical trial. Further characterization to identify the optimal combination dose is in progress.\n  * The safety profile of the rezatapopt and pembrolizumab combination has been consistent with either agent as monotherapy.\n  * Based on a preliminary review of the Phase 1b combination data, _KRAS_ wild-type patients experienced more of a clinical benefit compared to patients with a _KRAS_ single-nucleotide variant (SNV). As a result, PMV has decided to exclude patients with a _KRAS_ SNV from the Phase 1b combination arm in order to maximize the opportunity for patients to benefit from rezatapopt in combination with pembrolizumab. This exclusion criterion is aligned with the Phase 2 monotherapy portion of the PYNNACLE clinical trial.\n\n\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nPMV Pharma ended the second quarter with $212.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, compared to $213.1 million as of March 31, 2024. Net cash used in operations was $17.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $27.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n\n  * Net loss for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, was $1.2 million compared to $17.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The net loss reduction was a result of the company’s sale of its New Jersey accumulated net operating losses, with a corresponding $16.2 million income tax benefit.\n  * Research and development (R&D) expenses were $14.6 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $13.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily related to increased contractual research organization costs.\n  * General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $5.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $6.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in G&A expenses was primarily due to reduced spend for facility and operational expenses.\n\n\n\nKEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA.\n\n**About****Rezatapopt**\n\nRezatapopt (PC14586) is a first-in-class, small molecule, p53 reactivator designed to selectively bind to the pocket in the p53 Y220C mutant protein, restoring the wild-type tumor-suppressor function.
