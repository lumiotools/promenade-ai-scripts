This approval is a transformational milestone for both Journey Medical and the dermatology community, as Emrosi has the potential to become the best-in-class oral medication and standard of care to address inflammatory lesions of rosacea.”\n\nMr. Maraoui continued, “We also continued to commercialize our core dermatology products and experienced a solid third quarter of 2024, with $14.6 million in revenues. We look forward to continued growth with the anticipated launch of Emrosi in late first quarter or early second quarter of 2025.”\n\n**Financial Results:**\n\n  * Total net product revenues were $14.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 4% decrease compared to the third quarter of 2023. Qbrexza net product sales increased by $1.7 million, or 29%, from the same period in 2023, due to our focused marketing efforts and the expansion of our access and coverage platforms for the product offset by decreases in sales volume for the remainder of our products. \n  * Cost of goods sold decreased by $1.1 million, or 18%, compared to the third quarter of 2023, driving a 6.0% increase in our gross product margin from 57.9% in the prior year quarter, to 63.9% for the third quarter of 2024. The gross margin increase was mainly due to inventory charges recorded in the prior year period and a decrease in product royalties from the same period in 2023. \n  * Research and development costs decreased by $1.4 million compared to the prior year quarter due to lower clinical trial expenses to develop Emrosi. \n  * Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $2.8 million from the same period in 2023 mainly due to increases in non-cash share-based compensation expenses and overall selling and marketing expenses, including our pre-launch expenses for Emrosi. \n  * Net income for the third quarter of 2023 includes the one-time $19.0 million upfront payment received pursuant to our license agreement with Maruho Co., Ltd. Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $2.4 million, or $(0.12) per share basic and diluted, compared to net income of $16.8 million, or $0.91 per share basic and $0.80 per share diluted, for the third quarter of 2023. \n  * Our non-GAAP results in the table below reflect Adjusted EBITDA of $0.3 million, or $0.01 per share basic and diluted, for the third quarter of 2024 compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $20.8 million, or $1.13 per share basic and $0.99 per share diluted, for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2023 includes the one-time $19.0 million upfront payment received pursuant to our license agreement with Maruho Co., Ltd. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA per share basic and Adjusted EBITDA per share diluted are non-GAAP financial measures, each of which is reconciled to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP below under “ _Use of Non-GAAP Measures_.” \n  * At September 30, 2024, the Company had $22.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, as compared to $23.9 million at June 30, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Recent Corporate Highlights:**\n\n  * In November 2024, the U.S. FDA approved Emrosi (Minocycline Hydrochloride Extended Release Capsules, 40 mg) for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults.\n  * In October 2024, clinical data was presented at the 44th Fall Clinical Dermatology Conference assessing the dermal and systemic pharmacokinetics of Emrosi versus oral Doxycycline 40 mg capsules (Oracea®) in healthy subjects. With its extended-release formulation, Emrosi provides higher dermal concentration than doxycycline from Day 1 onward at a similar dose, expected to translate into a clinically meaningful impact for treating patients with rosacea, and as demonstrated in Emrosi’s Phase 3 clinical trials.\n  * In July 2024, Journey Medical appointed Michael C. Pearce to its Board of Directors. Mr. Pearce is an accomplished executive, with substantial strategic, business and financial experience across many industries, including healthcare. \n\n\n\n**About Journey Medical Corporation** Journey Medical Corporation (Nasdaq: DERM) (“Journey Medical”) is a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company that primarily focuses on the selling and marketing of FDA-approved prescription pharmaceutical products for the treatment of dermatological conditions through its efficient sales and marketing model.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) excluding interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization, less certain other non-cash and infrequent items not considered to be normal, recurring operating expenses, including, share-based compensation expense, amortization and impairments of acquired intangible assets, severance, short-term research and development expense and foreign exchange transaction losses. In particular, we exclude the following matters for the reasons more fully described below:\n\n  * _Share-Based Compensation Expense_ : We exclude share-based compensation from our adjusted financial results because share-based compensation expense, which is non-cash, fluctuates from period to period based on factors that are not within our control, such as our stock price on the dates share-based grants are issued.\n  * _Non-core and Short-term Research and Development Expense_ : We exclude research and development costs incurred in connection with Emrosi, formerly referred to as DFD-29, including the filing fee payment made to the FDA and contractual milestone payments, which was the only product in our portfolio not approved for marketing and sale during the reporting period, because we do not consider such costs to be normal, recurring operating expenses that are core to our long-term strategy. Instead, our long-term strategy is focused on the marketing and sale of our core FDA-approved dermatological products and out licensing our intellectual property and related technologies.\n  * _Amortization and impairments of Acquired Intangible Assets_ : We exclude the impact of certain amounts recorded in connection with the acquisitions of intangible assets that are either non-cash or not normal, recurring operating expenses due to their nature, variability of amounts, and lack of predictability as to occurrence and/or timing. These amounts may include non-cash items such as the amortization impairments of acquired intangible assets. \n\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA per share basic and Adjusted EBITDA per share diluted are determined by dividing the resulting Adjusted EBITDA by the number of shares outstanding on an actual and fully diluted basis.\n\nManagement believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s performance because (i) it allows for greater transparency with respect to key measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, (ii) it excludes the impact of non-cash or, when specified, non-recurring items that are not directly attributable to the Company’s core operating performance and that may obscure trends in the Company’s core operating performance and (iii) it is used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help analyze the Company's results. However, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA per share basic, Adjusted EBITDA per share diluted and any other non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Further, non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company and the manner in which they are calculated may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures or the calculations of the same non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, including the Company’s competitors.\n\nThe table below provides a reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures:\n\n**JOURNEY MEDICAL CORPORATION**  \n---  \n**Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA**  \n($ in thousands except for share and per share amounts)  \n**Three-Month Periods Ended** | **Nine-Month Periods Ended**  \n**September 30** | **September 30**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**GAAP Net Loss** | **$** | **(2,390** | **)** | **$** | **16,789** | **$** | **(16,193** | **)** | **$** | **(1,710** | **)**  \n**EBITDA:**  \nInterest | 570 | 260 | 1,303 | 1,465  \nTaxes | - | 95 | - | 95  \nAmortization of acquired intangible assets | 814 | 814 | 2,443 | 2,952  \n**EBITDA** | **(1,006** | **)** | **17,958** | **(12,447** | **)** | **2,802**  \n**Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA:**  \n**Non-Cash Components:**  \nShare-based compensation | 1,640 | 558 | 4,720 | 2,077  \nGain on extinguishment of debt | (1,125 | ) | - | (1,125 | ) | -  \nLoss on impairment of intangible assets | - | - | - | 3,143  \n**Non-core & Infrequent Components:**  \nShort-term R&D (includes one-time DFD-29 license and milestone payments) | 692 | 2,206 | 9,173 | 5,949  \nForeign exchange transaction losses | 51 | 100 | 104 | 181  \nSeverance | - | - | 147 | 711  \n**Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA** | **$** | **252** | **$** | **20,822** | **$** | **572** | **$** | **14,863**  \n**Net income (loss) & Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA per common share:**  \n**Basic**  \nGAAP Net Loss | $ | (0.12 | ) | $ | 0.91 | $ | (0.80 | ) | $ | (0.09 | )  \nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA | $ | 0.01 | $ | 1.13 | $ | 0.03 | $ | 0.82  \n**Diluted**  \nGAAP Net Loss | $ | (0.12 | ) | $ | 0.80 | $ | (0.80 | ) | $ | (0.09 | )  \nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA | $ | 0.01 | $ | 0.99 | $ | 0.02 | $ | 0.72  \n**Weighted average number of common shares:**  \nGAAP - Basic | 20,537,794 | 18,416,368 | 20,137,942 | 18,078,437  \nGAAP - Diluted | 20,537,794 | 21,034,758 | 20,137,942 | 18,078,437  \nNon-GAAP - Basic | 20,537,794 | 18,416,368 | 20,137,942 | 18,078,437  \nNon-GAAP - Diluted | 24,762,014 | 21,034,758 | 24,263,348 | 20,588,661  \n  \n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/68f0b467-248f-4250-9cda-2c7a68a11a1d/small/journeylogo-1-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/68f0b467-248f-4250-9cda-2c7a68a11a1d)\n\nSource: Journey Medical Corporation \n\nReleased November 12, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/email-alerts)\n  * [Contacts](/company/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://ir.journeymedicalcorp.com/new-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n\nWe use cookies to offer you a better browsing experience, including personalized advertising.

Emrosi was developed in collaboration with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd.\n\nClaude Maraoui, Co-Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Journey Medical, said, “With approval from the FDA, Journey Medical is proud to deliver Emrosi, a unique treatment option for the millions of patients in the U.S. suffering from rosacea. Rosacea is a difficult to treat skin condition and based on the favorable results from our Phase 3 clinical trials, Emrosi has potential to become the best-in-class oral medication to treat the condition. Our seasoned dermatology-focused sales force is now preparing for a successful launch and to establish Emrosi as a new standard of care in the treatment of rosacea. Journey Medical is committed to bringing cutting-edge innovation to patients with dermatological conditions and the healthcare professionals who treat them.”\n\nThe approval of Emrosi is supported by positive data from Journey Medical’s two Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of rosacea. The Phase 3 clinical trials met all co-primary and secondary endpoints, and subjects completed the 16-week treatment with no significant safety issues. Emrosi demonstrated statistically significant superiority over both the current standard-of-care treatment, Oracea® 40 mg capsules, and placebo for Investigator’s Global Assessment treatment success as well as the reduction in total inflammatory lesion count in both studies.\n\nJourney Medical is completing the manufacturing of Emrosi for the U.S. market and anticipates that initial supply will be available late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2025. Journey Medical intends to commercialize Emrosi in the U.S. with its dermatology-focused commercial organization. In line with the approved label, Journey Medical will execute a launch strategy to drive Emrosi toward becoming a new oral standard of care for adult rosacea patients.\n\nSrinivas Sidgiddi, M.D., Vice President, Research & Development at Journey Medical, added, “Emrosi showed great efficacy and tolerability in the pivotal clinical trials, and we are tremendously grateful to the patients, physicians, investigators, and site coordinators who participated and contributed to this important approval milestone.”\n\n**Conference Call and Replay Information** Journey Medical management will host a conference call to review the FDA approval on Monday, November 4, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.\n\nTo listen to the conference call, interested parties within the U.S. should dial 1-866-777-2509 (domestic) or 1-412-317-5413 for international callers.

If DRESS syndrome is recognized, discontinue EMROSI immediately. Use during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, infancy and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth and reversible inhibition of bone growth. Discontinue EMROSI use if Antibiotic-Associated Colitis occurs. Discontinue EMROSI if liver injury is suspected. Patients experiencing light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo should be cautioned about driving vehicles or operating heavy machinery. Clinical manifestations include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss. Discontinue EMROSI immediately if symptoms occur. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. Discontinue EMROSI immediately if symptoms occur. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight while using EMROSI. Tetracycline-class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. EMROSI may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity, sclerae and heart valves. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of EMROSI, use EMROSI only as indicated. If superinfection occurs, discontinue EMROSI and institute appropriate therapy. Perform periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

DFD-29 is being developed for the treatment of rosacea in collaboration with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd.\n\nClaude Maraoui, Co-Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Journey Medical, stated, “Based on the robust safety and efficacy data seen throughout all our clinical trials, we believe DFD-29 can change the treatment landscape for the millions of patients suffering from rosacea. We submitted a New Drug Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for DFD-29 earlier this year and look forward to the upcoming PDUFA date of November 4, 2024. If approved, DFD-29 has the potential to be the lowest fixed-dose minocycline and the best-in-class therapy for rosacea patients.”\n\nThis randomized, open-label, single-center, parallel-group study evaluated the systemic and dermal PK of once-daily administration of oral DFD-29 40 mg capsules versus oral doxycycline 40 mg for 21 days in healthy adult volunteers. Plasma PK parameters (Cmax & AUC) were similar on Day 1 and Day 21 for minocycline (DFD-29), but doxycycline showed accumulation in the plasma with a significant increase in PK parameters from Day 1 to Day 21. Mean dermal Cmax and AUC for minocycline (DFD-29) reached maximum levels on Day 1 and remained at a high level until Day 21, while doxycycline started with low levels on Day 1 and attained peak on Day 21. Minocycline (DFD-29) had significantly higher levels than doxycycline in the skin both on Day 1 and Day 21. Both DFD-29 and doxycycline were well tolerated by the healthy volunteers.\n\nSrinivas Sidgiddi, M.D., Vice President, Research & Development at Journey Medical, said, “With its modified-release formulation, DFD-29 (40 mg) provides higher dermal concentration than a similar dose of doxycycline from Day 1 and onward. These PK data suggest DFD-29 could have a clinically meaningful impact in treating patients with rosacea.”\n\n**About Rosacea** Rosacea is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin condition that most commonly presents with symptoms such as deep facial redness, acne-like inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) and spider veins (telangiectasia).

This approval is a transformational milestone for both Journey Medical and the dermatology community, as Emrosi has the potential to become the best-in-class oral medication and standard of care to address inflammatory lesions of rosacea.”\n\nMr. Maraoui continued, “We also continued to commercialize our core dermatology products and experienced a solid third quarter of 2024, with $14.6 million in revenues. We look forward to continued growth with the anticipated launch of Emrosi in late first quarter or early second quarter of 2025.”\n\n**Financial Results:**\n\n  * Total net product revenues were $14.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 4% decrease compared to the third quarter of 2023. Qbrexza net product sales increased by $1.7 million, or 29%, from the same period in 2023, due to our focused marketing efforts and the expansion of our access and coverage platforms for the product offset by decreases in sales volume for the remainder of our products. \n  * Cost of goods sold decreased by $1.1 million, or 18%, compared to the third quarter of 2023, driving a 6.0% increase in our gross product margin from 57.9% in the prior year quarter, to 63.9% for the third quarter of 2024. The gross margin increase was mainly due to inventory charges recorded in the prior year period and a decrease in product royalties from the same period in 2023. \n  * Research and development costs decreased by $1.4 million compared to the prior year quarter due to lower clinical trial expenses to develop Emrosi. \n  * Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $2.8 million from the same period in 2023 mainly due to increases in non-cash share-based compensation expenses and overall selling and marketing expenses, including our pre-launch expenses for Emrosi. \n  * Net income for the third quarter of 2023 includes the one-time $19.0 million upfront payment received pursuant to our license agreement with Maruho Co., Ltd. Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $2.4 million, or $(0.12) per share basic and diluted, compared to net income of $16.8 million, or $0.91 per share basic and $0.80 per share diluted, for the third quarter of 2023. \n  * Our non-GAAP results in the table below reflect Adjusted EBITDA of $0.3 million, or $0.01 per share basic and diluted, for the third quarter of 2024 compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $20.8 million, or $1.13 per share basic and $0.99 per share diluted, for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2023 includes the one-time $19.0 million upfront payment received pursuant to our license agreement with Maruho Co., Ltd. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA per share basic and Adjusted EBITDA per share diluted are non-GAAP financial measures, each of which is reconciled to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP below under “ _Use of Non-GAAP Measures_.” \n  * At September 30, 2024, the Company had $22.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, as compared to $23.9 million at June 30, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Recent Corporate Highlights:**\n\n  * In November 2024, the U.S. FDA approved Emrosi (Minocycline Hydrochloride Extended Release Capsules, 40 mg) for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults.\n  * In October 2024, clinical data was presented at the 44th Fall Clinical Dermatology Conference assessing the dermal and systemic pharmacokinetics of Emrosi versus oral Doxycycline 40 mg capsules (Oracea®) in healthy subjects. With its extended-release formulation, Emrosi provides higher dermal concentration than doxycycline from Day 1 onward at a similar dose, expected to translate into a clinically meaningful impact for treating patients with rosacea, and as demonstrated in Emrosi’s Phase 3 clinical trials.\n  * In July 2024, Journey Medical appointed Michael C. Pearce to its Board of Directors. Mr. Pearce is an accomplished executive, with substantial strategic, business and financial experience across many industries, including healthcare. \n\n\n\n**About Journey Medical Corporation** Journey Medical Corporation (Nasdaq: DERM) (“Journey Medical”) is a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company that primarily focuses on the selling and marketing of FDA-approved prescription pharmaceutical products for the treatment of dermatological conditions through its efficient sales and marketing model.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) excluding interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization, less certain other non-cash and infrequent items not considered to be normal, recurring operating expenses, including, share-based compensation expense, amortization and impairments of acquired intangible assets, severance, short-term research and development expense and foreign exchange transaction losses. In particular, we exclude the following matters for the reasons more fully described below:\n\n  * _Share-Based Compensation Expense_ : We exclude share-based compensation from our adjusted financial results because share-based compensation expense, which is non-cash, fluctuates from period to period based on factors that are not within our control, such as our stock price on the dates share-based grants are issued.\n  * _Non-core and Short-term Research and Development Expense_ : We exclude research and development costs incurred in connection with Emrosi, formerly referred to as DFD-29, including the filing fee payment made to the FDA and contractual milestone payments, which was the only product in our portfolio not approved for marketing and sale during the reporting period, because we do not consider such costs to be normal, recurring operating expenses that are core to our long-term strategy. Instead, our long-term strategy is focused on the marketing and sale of our core FDA-approved dermatological products and out licensing our intellectual property and related technologies.\n  * _Amortization and impairments of Acquired Intangible Assets_ : We exclude the impact of certain amounts recorded in connection with the acquisitions of intangible assets that are either non-cash or not normal, recurring operating expenses due to their nature, variability of amounts, and lack of predictability as to occurrence and/or timing. These amounts may include non-cash items such as the amortization impairments of acquired intangible assets. \n\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA per share basic and Adjusted EBITDA per share diluted are determined by dividing the resulting Adjusted EBITDA by the number of shares outstanding on an actual and fully diluted basis.\n\nManagement believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s performance because (i) it allows for greater transparency with respect to key measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, (ii) it excludes the impact of non-cash or, when specified, non-recurring items that are not directly attributable to the Company’s core operating performance and that may obscure trends in the Company’s core operating performance and (iii) it is used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help analyze the Company's results. However, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA per share basic, Adjusted EBITDA per share diluted and any other non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Further, non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company and the manner in which they are calculated may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures or the calculations of the same non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, including the Company’s competitors.\n\nThe table below provides a reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP measures:\n\n**JOURNEY MEDICAL CORPORATION**  \n---  \n**Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA**  \n($ in thousands except for share and per share amounts)  \n**Three-Month Periods Ended** | **Nine-Month Periods Ended**  \n**September 30** | **September 30**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**GAAP Net Loss** | **$** | **(2,390** | **)** | **$** | **16,789** | **$** | **(16,193** | **)** | **$** | **(1,710** | **)**  \n**EBITDA:**  \nInterest | 570 | 260 | 1,303 | 1,465  \nTaxes | - | 95 | - | 95  \nAmortization of acquired intangible assets | 814 | 814 | 2,443 | 2,952  \n**EBITDA** | **(1,006** | **)** | **17,958** | **(12,447** | **)** | **2,802**  \n**Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA:**  \n**Non-Cash Components:**  \nShare-based compensation | 1,640 | 558 | 4,720 | 2,077  \nGain on extinguishment of debt | (1,125 | ) | - | (1,125 | ) | -  \nLoss on impairment of intangible assets | - | - | - | 3,143  \n**Non-core & Infrequent Components:**  \nShort-term R&D (includes one-time DFD-29 license and milestone payments) | 692 | 2,206 | 9,173 | 5,949  \nForeign exchange transaction losses | 51 | 100 | 104 | 181  \nSeverance | - | - | 147 | 711  \n**Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA** | **$** | **252** | **$** | **20,822** | **$** | **572** | **$** | **14,863**  \n**Net income (loss) & Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA per common share:**  \n**Basic**  \nGAAP Net Loss | $ | (0.12 | ) | $ | 0.91 | $ | (0.80 | ) | $ | (0.09 | )  \nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA | $ | 0.01 | $ | 1.13 | $ | 0.03 | $ | 0.82  \n**Diluted**  \nGAAP Net Loss | $ | (0.12 | ) | $ | 0.80 | $ | (0.80 | ) | $ | (0.09 | )  \nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA | $ | 0.01 | $ | 0.99 | $ | 0.02 | $ | 0.72  \n**Weighted average number of common shares:**  \nGAAP - Basic | 20,537,794 | 18,416,368 | 20,137,942 | 18,078,437  \nGAAP - Diluted | 20,537,794 | 21,034,758 | 20,137,942 | 18,078,437  \nNon-GAAP - Basic | 20,537,794 | 18,416,368 | 20,137,942 | 18,078,437  \nNon-GAAP - Diluted | 24,762,014 | 21,034,758 | 24,263,348 | 20,588,661  \n  \n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/68f0b467-248f-4250-9cda-2c7a68a11a1d/small/journeylogo-1-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/68f0b467-248f-4250-9cda-2c7a68a11a1d)\n\nSource: Journey Medical Corporation \n\nReleased November 12, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/email-alerts)\n  * [Contacts](/company/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://ir.journeymedicalcorp.com/new-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n\nWe use cookies to offer you a better browsing experience, including personalized advertising.

The risks described below are a summary\nof the principal risks associated with an investment in our common stock and are not the only risks we face. These risks are more fully described in the\nsection titled “Risk Factors” of this report on Form 10-K and include the following:\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry and Existing Operating Revenue Stream\n● Our products and product candidates are subject to time and cost intensive regulation and clinical testing. As a result, they may never be\nsuccessfully developed or commercialized. Further, any approved product may be subject to post-marketing requirements, including studies or\nclinical trials, the results of which could cause such product to be withdrawn from the market.\n● A substantial portion of our sales derive from products that are without patent protection and/or are or may become subject to third-party generic\ncompetition, the introduction of new competitor products, or an increase in market share of existing competitor products, any of which could have a\nsignificant adverse impact on our operating income.\n● We operate in a heavily regulated industry, and we cannot predict the impact that any future legislation or administrative or executive action may\nhave on our operations.\n● Our revenue is dependent mainly upon sales of our dermatology products and any setback relating to the sale of such products could impair our\noperating results.\n● Our competitors may develop treatments for our products’ target indications, which could limit our products’ commercial opportunity and\nprofitability.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\n● We rely on third parties for several aspects of our operations, which limits our control over product development, marketing, manufacturing, and\nsale processes and may hinder our ability to develop and commercialize our products in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nRisks Related to Our Growth\n● Our future growth may depend on our ability to identify, develop, and acquire or in-license products and integrate them into our operations, at\nwhich we may be unsuccessful.\n● We may expend resources on unsuccessful product candidates or indications and may fail to capitalize on more profitable or successful product\ncandidates or indications.\n● There is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. We may need to raise additional funding (which may not be\navailable on acceptable terms to the Company, or at all) and/or to delay, limit or terminate certain of our product development and\ncommercialization efforts or other operations.\nRisks Related to Development and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates (DFD-29)\n● The success of our business, including our ability to finance our company and generate additional revenue, may depend on the successful\ndevelopment and regulatory approval of the DFD-29 product candidate and any future product candidates that we may develop, in-license or\nacquire.\n● Clinical drug development is very expensive, time consuming, and uncertain. Our clinical trials may fail to adequately demonstrate the safety and\nefficacy of our current or any future product candidates, which could prevent or delay regulatory approval and commercialization.\n4\nTable of Contents\n● We expect to rely on third-party contract research organizations (“CROs”) and other third parties to conduct and oversee our clinical trials, other\naspects of our product development and our regulatory submission process for our product candidates. If these third parties do not meet our\nrequirements, conduct the trials as required or otherwise provide services as anticipated, we may not be able to satisfy our contractual obligations or\nobtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our current or any future product candidates when expected or at all.\nRisks Pertaining to Intellectual Property, Generic Competition and Paragraph IV Litigation\n● If we are unable to maintain sufficient patent protection for our technology and products, our competitors could develop and commercialize\nproducts similar or identical to ours.\n● Any dispute with our licensors may affect our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates.\n● Generic drug companies may submit applications seeking approval to market generic versions of our products.\n● In connection with these applications, generic drug companies may seek to challenge the validity and enforceability of our patents through litigation\nand/or with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”). Such challenges may subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation\nand/or USPTO proceedings.\n● As a result of the loss of any patent protection from such litigation or USPTO proceedings, or the “at-risk” launch by a generic competitor of our\nproducts, our products could be sold at significantly lower prices, and we could lose a significant portion of sales of that product in a short period of\ntime, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nRisks Related to our Platform and Data\n● Our business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks, or deficiencies in our or our third parties’\ncybersecurity.\nRisks Related to Our Finances and Capital Requirements\n● Due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we may incur losses and may be unable to\nmaintain profitability.\n● If we are unable to raise capital as needed, we may be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our operations.\nRisks Relating to Owning our Common Stock\n● Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to do so. Any such fluctuation may cause our performance to fall\nbelow expectations, and our stock price may suffer.\nRisks Related to our Relationship with Fortress Biotech, Inc. (“Fortress”)\n● Fortress controls a voting majority of our common stock, which could be detrimental to our other shareholders. Further, Fortress’ ownership\nqualifies us as a “controlled company” under the Nasdaq listing standards.\n● Fortress’ financial obligations and any potential risk of default may adversely affect the Company or constrain our ability to take certain actions.\n5\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1. Business\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company founded in October 2014 that focuses on the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical\nproducts for the treatment of dermatological conditions. Our current portfolio includes seven branded and two authorized generic prescription drugs for\ndermatological conditions that are marketed in the U.S. We are managed by experienced life science executives with a track record of creating value for\ntheir stakeholders and bringing novel medicines to the market, enabling patients to experience increased quality of life, and enabling physicians and other\nlicensed medical professionals to provide better care for their patients. We aim to acquire rights to future products by licensing or otherwise acquiring an\nownership interest in, funding the research and development of, and eventually commercializing, these products through our field sales organization. Since\ninception, we have made significant investments to build out our commercial product portfolios, which we believe, coupled with our experienced\ndermatology sales leadership team and our seasoned field sales force, will position our business for growth. We are a majority-owned subsidiary of\nFortress.\n2023 Highlights and Events\nOn December 27, 2023, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with SWK Funding LLC (“SWK”). The Credit Agreement provides\nfor a term loan facility (the “Credit Facility”) in the original principal amount of up to $20.0 million. On the closing date, we drew $15.0 million. The\nremaining $5.0 million may be drawn upon our request within 12 months after the closing date. Loans under the Credit Facility (the “Term Loans”) mature\non December 27, 2027 unless the Credit Facility is otherwise terminated pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement and bear interest at a rate per\nannum equal to the three-month term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) (subject to a SOFR floor of 5%) plus 7.75%. The interest rate resets\nquarterly. Interest payments begin in February 2024 and are paid quarterly. Beginning in February 2026, we are required to repay the outstanding principal\nof the Term Loans quarterly in an amount equal to 7.5% of the principal amount of funded Term Loans. If our total revenue, measured on a trailing twelve-\nmonth basis, is greater than $70 million as of December 31, 2025, principal repayment is not required until February 2027, at which point we are required\nto repay a portion of the outstanding principal of the Term Loans quarterly in an amount equal to 15% of the principal amount of funded Term Loans.\nOn August 31, 2023, we entered into a license agreement (the “New License Agreement”) with Maruho Co., Ltd., a Japanese company specializing in\ndermatology (“Maruho”), whereby we granted an exclusive license to Maruho to develop and commercialize Qbrexza® for the treatment of primary axillary\nhyperhidrosis in South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Vietnam, Brunei, Cambodia, Myanmar\nand Laos (the “Territory”). Under the terms of the New License Agreement, Maruho paid us $19.0 million as a non-refundable upfront payment. Maruho is\nalso obligated to make royalty payments to us related to sales of the product in the Territory equal to the corresponding rate payable by us to Dermira under\nthe asset purchase agreement between us and Dermira.\nIn July 2023, we announced positive topline data from our two DFD-29 Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of papulopustular rosacea. The Phase 3\nclinical trials achieved the co-primary and all secondary endpoints, the subjects completed the 16-week treatment and the drug was well-tolerated. DFD-29\ndemonstrated statistical superiority over both the standard of care, Oracea® capsules, and placebo for Investigator’s Global Assessment treatment success\nand the reduction in the total inflammatory lesion count in both studies. We summitted a New Drug Application (“NDA”) under Section 505(b)(2) of the\nUnited States Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for DFD-29 on January 4, 2024,\npaying a $4.0 million filing fee, and expect potential approval from the FDA in the second half of 2024. On March 18, 2024, we announced the FDA\naccepted the Company’s NDA with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date of November 4, 2024.\nCORPORATE INFORMATION\nJourney Medical Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 2014.

These products were launched in January 2020; and\n● doxycycline hyclate immediate release 50mg tablets, indicated as adjunctive therapy for severe acne to reduce the development of drug-resistant\nbacteria as well as to maintain the effectiveness of doxycycline hyclate and other antibacterial drugs, launched in May 2018.\n7\nTable of Contents\nOur Products and Relevant Disease States\nExcessive Underarm Sweating and the Current Standard of Care\nExcessive underarm sweating, commonly referred to as primary axillary hyperhidrosis (“PAH”), is a rare disorder characterized by excessive sweating in\nthe armpits. The exact cause of PAH is not known, and the disorder affects males and females equally. When excessive sweating occurs as part of some\nother disorder, it is said to be secondary hyperhidrosis, which is a more commonly encountered condition than is primary hyperhidrosis. According to a\n2016 article published in the Archives of Dermatological Research, there are approximately 10 million people who suffer from PAH in the United States.\nThe symptoms of PAH typically begin during childhood or puberty and may often, although not always, persist throughout a person’s life. Affected\nindividuals may experience a heightened reaction to certain stimuli that can cause sweating such as anxiety, pain, exercise, tension, caffeine, and/or\nnicotine. The symptoms of this disorder develop due to overactivity of certain sweat glands, and incidences may be precipitated by social and/or physical\nstress. Some people with PAH experience relief from the symptoms during adulthood without treatment or obvious reason for the remission.\nPharmacological treatment options for PAH include topical, oral and iontophoretic treatments.\nQbrexza® (glycopyrronium 2.4% cloth) for the Treatment of Primary Axillary Hyperhidrosis\nOur Qbrexza® (glycopyrronium 2.4%) product is a topical, once-daily anticholinergic cloth that was approved by the FDA in June 2018 for the treatment of\nPAH in adult and pediatric patients nine years of age and older. Anticholinergics are a class of pharmaceutical products that exert their effect by blocking\nthe action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that transmits signals within the nervous system that are responsible for the activation of sweat glands.\nQbrexza is applied directly to the skin and is designed to block underarm sweat production by inhibiting sweat gland activation. Qbrexza has Orange Book-\nlisted patents that extend through February of 2033.\nThe PAH market had approximately 450,000 prescriptions in 2023 according to Symphony Health, excluding over-the-counter (“OTC”) clinical strength\nanti-perspirants.\nAcne and the Current Standard of Care\nAcne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a common skin disorder characterized by a blockage of hair follicles, which are clogged with oil and dead skin cells.\nAccording to the American Academy of Dermatology (“AAD”), acne is the most common skin condition in the US, affecting up to 50 million individuals\nannually.\nApproximately 85% of people between the ages of 12 and 24 experience at least a minor form of acne. The disease is classified as mild, moderate or severe\nbased on the severity of the disease progression, which is useful in identifying an appropriate treatment regimen. Mild acne is characterized by clogged hair\nfollicles (known as comedones) that are either exposed to air (blackheads) or closed (whiteheads), with occasional inflammatory lesions which occur\nprimarily on the face. Moderate acne is characterized by a higher presence of inflammatory lesions known as papules and pustules across the face and\nextending to the trunk. Severe acne is characterized by painful, deep lesions called nodules across the face, with extensive involvement of the trunk\nfrequently.\nTreatment options are based on the severity of disease, with certain drugs being reserved for more severe forms of the disease. Mild acne is addressed with\ndietary and lifestyle changes, along with OTC and prescription topical agents. Other therapies with varying degrees of success include dermabrasion and\nchemical peels, light therapy and hormonal therapy such as birth control pills or spironolactone. Moderate acne is treated with more aggressive therapy\nincluding topical and oral antibiotics such as tetracyclines, which are particularly effective due to their antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, and\nother topical agents including benzoyl peroxide and retinoids. Severe acne is treated with combination therapies, often including oral antibiotics. For\nresistant cases, physicians may use a potent drug known as isotretinoin (a vitamin A analog), which requires Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy\n(“REMS”) (safety) monitoring with regard to pregnancy. The current U.S. market size for treatment of acne is considerable and estimated at approximately\n$3 billion annually, according to the American Medical Association.\n8\nTable of Contents\nAccutane® for the Treatment of Severe Recalcitrant Nodular Acne\nAccutane® (isotretinoin 10mg, 20mg, 30mg, and 40mg capsules USP) is indicated for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne. Accutane is used to\ntreat a type of severe recalcitrant nodular acne that has not been helped by other treatments, including antibiotics. Severe recalcitrant nodular acne occurs\nwhen many red, swollen, tender lumps form in the skin. Patients with severe nodular acne are at higher risk of scarring. Accutane belongs to a class of drugs\nthat affects all four major pathogenic processes in acne: increased sebum production, irregular follicular desquamation, propionibacterium acnes\nproliferation and inflammation. Accutane has achieved a strong market position and is well known in the dermatology community.\nThe oral isotretinoin market had over 2 million prescriptions in 2023 according to Symphony Health.\nTargadox® for the Treatment of Severe Acne\nTargadox® (doxycycline hyclate immediate release 50mg tablets) is indicated as adjunctive therapy for severe acne, which is part of a class of oral\nantibiotics known as tetracyclines. The tetracycline class, which includes minocycline, doxycycline, sarecycline and tetracycline, is particularly effective in\ntreatment for more severe forms of acne due to its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Targadox is gluten-free, lactose-free, animal byproduct-\nfree, and GMO-free.\nThe oral doxycycline market had more than 27 million prescriptions in 2023 according to Symphony Health.\nAmzeeq® for the Treatment of Moderate-to-Severe Acne\nAmzeeq® (4% minocycline foam), formerly known as FMX101, was approved by the FDA in October 2019 and became available in pharmacies\nnationwide in January 2020. Amzeeq is a once-daily novel topical antibiotic foam formulation of minocycline for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of\nnon-nodular moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris in patients nine years of age and older. Amzeeq utilizes proprietary MST™ technology and is the first topical\nminocycline to be approved by the FDA for any condition. We believe that the combination of a well-established antibiotic in a well-tolerated, easy to use\nfoam makes Amzeeq a very attractive treatment option for patients.\nThe topical acne market had almost 21 million prescriptions in 2023 according to Symphony Health, presenting significant unmet needs of patients and\nhealthcare providers to be addressed. As the first topical minocycline to be approved by the FDA for any condition, we believe that Amzeeq may provide a\nnew treatment alternative for patients and healthcare providers who are unsatisfied with their current therapies. Amzeeq has Orange Book-listed patents that\nextend through September of 2037.\nXimino® for the Treatment of Inflammatory Lesions of Non-Nodular Moderate to Severe Acne\nDuring fiscal 2022 and part of fiscal 2023, we marketed and sold Ximino® (minocycline hydrochloride extended-release 45mg, 90mg, and 135mg\ncapsules), which is indicated for the treatment of inflammatory non-nodular lesions (pimples and red bumps) associated with moderate to severe acne. We\ndiscontinued selling Ximino in September 2023.\nThe oral minocycline market had just under 2.7 million prescriptions in 2023 according to Symphony Health.\nFungal Infections of the Skin and the Current Standard of Care\nFungal skin infections, collectively referred to as dermatomycoses, are common infections caused by ringworms (tinea) and include conditions such as\nathlete’s foot, jock itch and ringworm of the body. Tinea pedis, commonly known as athlete’s foot, is a form of ringworm that usually develops between\nthe toes. Symptoms include peeling, cracking and scaly feet, blisters, and skin that is red, softened, itching, or burning. Tinea cruris, commonly known as\njock itch, is a form of ringworm that affects the groin. Tinea corporis, commonly known as ringworm of the body, is a fungal infection that appears on the\nbody in which the outer part of the sore might be raised while the skin in the middle appears normal. Fungal infections caused by ringworm cause skin\nrashes that present as itchy, red, raised and scaly rings. These infections are easily transmissible between people, pets or contaminated objects or surfaces\nbut are usually not serious in nature.\n9\nTable of Contents\nTreatment options typically involve topical OTC and prescription antifungal medications. Where difficult to administer topically, oral options (such as for\ntoenail fungus or oral thrush) or suppositories (such as for vaginal yeast infections) have proven to be more effective. OTC products typically include\nknown antifungal ingredients such as clotrimazole, miconazole, terbinafine or ketoconazole. Prescription treatments are often reserved for more serious\ninfection or for those in hard-to-treat areas. In conjunction with OTC or prescription medications, lifestyle adjustments, including daily washing of bedding\nand clothing during an infection, drying thoroughly after bathing, wearing loose clothing in affected areas and actively treating infected areas, can all\ncontribute to disinfecting your surroundings and preventing a prolongation or recurrence of infection.\nExelderm® for the Treatment of Fungal Skin Infections\nExelderm® (sulconazole nitrate 1%, cream and solution) is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent indicated for the treatment of ringworm-caused fungal\ninfections including tinea pedis, tinea cruris, tinea corporis and tinea versicolor. The active pharmaceutical ingredient (sulconazole) acts by inhibiting\nfungal cell division and growth and has been shown to have broad activity against candida species, aspergillus species and dermatophytes. Exelderm cream\nor solution is administered externally only, whereby a small amount of cream or solution is gently massaged into the affected and surrounding areas and\nonly requires a convenient once or twice daily application. However, when used to treat tinea pedis, for which Exelderm cream is also indicated, twice daily\napplication is required.\nThe topical antifungal market had more than 11 million prescriptions in 2023 according to Symphony Health.\nPruritus (Itch) and the Current Standard of Care\nPruritus or itch is defined as an unpleasant sensation of the skin that provokes the urge to scratch. It is a characteristic feature of many skin diseases and an\nunusual sign of some systemic diseases. Pruritus may be localized or generalized and can occur as an acute or chronic condition. Itch can be caused by a\nnumber of conditions, including skin conditions such as dry skin, eczema, psoriasis, scabies, parasites, burns, scars, insect bites and hives. Depending on the\ncause of itchiness, skin may appear normal, red, rough or bumpy. Repeated scratching can cause raised thick areas of skin that might bleed or become\ninfected.\nTreatment for itch may include moisturizing daily, using gentle cleansers, and bathing with lukewarm water. Long-term relief requires identifying and\ntreating the underlying cause of itchy skin. Common treatments are prescription medicated creams and lotions, moist dressings, and oral anti-itch\nmedicines.\nAnti-Itch Product for the Treatment of Pruritus\nOur acquired anti-itch product is indicated to treat pruritis, scabies, and other skin itch conditions (“Anti-itch Product”). Our Anti-itch Product delivers\nprescription relief and is non-steroidal and antihistamine free. Topical steroids are effective against itch because they reduce inflammation that can cause\nitch. However, they are not recommended for long-term use. Antihistamines are also effective in treating some types of itch, but they too have drawbacks\nwith continued use. We plan on launching our Anti-itch Product through our field sales force during the second half of 2024 or first half of 2025.\nRosacea and the Current Standard of Care\nRosacea is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin condition that most commonly presents with symptoms such as deep facial redness, acne-like\ninflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) and spider veins (telangiectasia). According to The National Rosacea Society, it is estimated that rosacea\naffects well over 16 million Americans (F1000Research 2018, 7(F1000 Faculty Rev):1885) and as many as 415 million people worldwide. Rosacea is most\nfrequently seen in adults between 30 and 50 years of age. Surveys conducted by The National Rosacea Society report more than 90% of rosacea patients\nsaid their condition had lowered their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% reported that it had caused them to avoid public contact or cancel social\nengagements. Among rosacea patients with severe symptoms, 88% said the disorder had adversely affected their professional interactions, and 51% said\nthey had missed work because of their condition. The rosacea market had 3.8 million prescriptions in 2023 according to Symphony Health.\n10\nTable of Contents\nThe tetracycline class of antibiotics (minocycline and doxycycline) are considered to be effective options for the treatment of papulopustular rosacea, likely\ndue to anti-inflammatory activities that are usually manifested at doses much lower than those prescribed for treatment of bacterial infections. A low dose\nof doxycycline (i.e., 40 mg taken once daily) as oral formulation has been approved for the treatment of only inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) of\nrosacea and is available under the proprietary name Oracea® in the US. Oracea is generally considered to be the current standard of care. Minocycline, first\nintroduced in 1971, is widely believed to be the most effective tetracycline agent due to its high lipophilicity, which is anticipated to permit greater\npermeation into, and accumulation in, the sebaceous follicles and layers of the epidermis. We offer two products, Zilxi and, if approved, DFD-29, that we\nbelieve provide a new treatment alternative for patients and healthcare providers who are unsatisfied with their current rosacea therapies.\nZilxi® for the Treatment of Papulopustular Rosacea\nZilxi® (1.5% minocycline foam), was approved by the FDA in May 2020 and became available in pharmacies nationwide in October 2020. Zilxi is a once-\ndaily novel antibiotic foam formulation of minocycline for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults. Similar to Amzeeq, Zilxi leverages\nMST™ technology and is the first minocycline product of any form to be approved by the FDA for use in rosacea. We believe the anti-inflammatory\nproperties of minocycline delivered in our innovative foam technology make Zilxi a highly appealing treatment option for rosacea patients. Zilxi has\nOrange Book-listed patents that extend through October of 2030.\nDFD-29 for the Treatment of Rosacea\nDFD-29 is a low-dose minocycline (40 mg) extended release capsule formulation for oral use for the treatment of papulopustular rosacea. The rationale of\nselecting DFD-29 doses lower than the approved minocycline dose is based on the lower protein binding and higher lipophilicity of minocycline. In a Phase\n1 PK study (DFD-29-CD-001) in 24 healthy subjects, the systemic exposure of minocycline from DFD-29 (minocycline HCl) ER capsules 40 mg was much\nlower than that seen with the approved antibiotic dose of minocycline, although this was not a head-to-head study. A Phase 2 study (DFD-29-CD-002) in\n205 subjects with papulopustular rosacea, demonstrated that DFD-29 (40 mg) was significantly superior to placebo and Oracea®, on the co-primary\nendpoints of IGA treatment success and absolute inflammatory lesion count reduction. The study also showed DFD-29 was well-tolerated. DFD-29 has also\nshown superiority to Oracea and Placebo on the co-primary endpoints and all secondary endpoints in two phase 3 studies and was well-tolerated. The NDA\nwas filed under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, in January 2024 and is under review by the FDA.\nLuxamend® for Wound Healing\nLuxamend® is a water-based wound cream formulated for the dressing and management of superficial wounds; minor abrasions; dermal ulcers; donor sites;\n1st and 2nd degree burns, including sunburns; and radiation dermatitis. Luxamend contains purified water, white mineral oil, ethylene glycol monostearate,\nstearic acid, propylene glycol, paraffin wax, squalane, avocado oil, trolamine/sodium alginate, triethanolamine, cetyl palmitate, sodium sulfate (anhydrous),\npotassium sorbate, methylparaben sodium, propylparaben sodium, sodium hexametaphosphate, sulfamic acid, and allergen-free fragrance. When applied\nproperly to a wound, Luxamend provides an optimum moist environment for the healing process. It is approved as a prescription medical device and is\nsupplied in a 114 gram tube.\nOur Strategy\nWe are a highly focused, pharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing therapies for the treatment of dermatologic conditions that\nseeks to deliver value to patients, physicians and the healthcare system, as well as to our stakeholders. Our strategic priorities include continuing to augment\nand grow our product portfolio and organization in order to maximize long-term value creation. This will consist of both commercial execution on our\nexisting product portfolio, including lifecycle management, out-licensing of our current branded products and/or technologies in global markets, as well as\ninvesting in additional growth strategies through product and company acquisitions, licensing, or developing new products.\nAn important part of our growth strategy is to identify new business development opportunities, including development stage and commercial drugs that we\nmay acquire from other pharmaceutical companies. We are in various stages of discussion for other opportunities, both commercial and development stage,\nthat could drive additional growth in the business. Successful development and commercialization of any future in-licensed development stage or\ncommercial drugs will require us to navigate the many laws and regulations of governmental authorities and regulatory agencies around the world,\nincluding the FDA, relating to the manufacture, development, approval and commercialization of investigational drugs. For development stage drugs, we\nmay require financial resources significantly in excess of our current cash on hand and amounts that we may borrow under our Credit Facility, and it may\ntake many years for us to receive marketing approval, if ever, for any in-licensed or acquired product candidate.\n11\nTable of Contents\nCompetitive Strengths\nTo successfully execute our strategy, we must continue to capitalize on our following core strengths:\n● Commercial leadership of our management team with a track record of commercial execution. We have a highly skilled and customer-focused\nmanagement team in critical leadership positions across our Company. Our senior management team has over 135 years of collective sales and\nmarketing experience in the pharmaceutical industry and a proven track record of developing businesses and creating value. Members of our\nmanagement team have developed, launched, commercialized, and managed brands generating over $3 billion in aggregate peak sales, collectively,\nat leading dermatology organizations. This experience includes improving business performance through organic revenue growth, maximizing\noperational efficiencies and through the identification, consummation and integration of licensing and acquisition opportunities. Our senior\nmanagement team has extensive roots in the dermatology industry, with many of them having worked at and held senior positions with Medicis\nPharmaceutical, Inc. leading up to the company’s acquisition by Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (now Bausch Health Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) for $2.6\nbillion in 2012. Our strategic approach leverages our management team’s experience with the capabilities of our field sales force to drive\nperformance based on prescribing habits, brand preferences, promotional strategies and profit optimization while focusing on customer service\nexcellence for our providers and their patients.\n● Performance and experience of our accomplished field sales force. Our current seasoned field sales force has deep-rooted and longstanding\ncustomer relationships in their respective territories. We have strategically optimized our sales outreach to cover over 80% of dermatologists in the\ntop 50 U.S. metropolitan statistical areas and over 70% of the overall dermatology prescribing market. We are able to leverage the experience of our\nfield sales force to create a tailored and entrepreneurial compensation plan that incentivizes our field sales force and aligns their activities with our\ncorporate performance and growth objectives. We intend to continue to build a team of committed, experienced employees and to engage with\npatients and members of the dermatology community. Additionally, we believe that consolidation in the medical dermatology industry has resulted\nin an enhanced opportunity for a medical dermatology-focused company to build relationships with these stakeholders and has made available a\nlarge and growing talent pool of experienced individuals who can make significant contributions to our Company.\n● Specialized and differentiated access and distribution model. We have a specialized and differentiated access and distribution network of over 600\nspecialty pharmacies and wholesalers, where we directly sell our products, with limited distribution through traditional national wholesalers. This\ndecentralized approach allows us to maximize our brand equity across our product portfolio through strategic relationships directly with pharmacies\nand allows us to provide exceptional customer service and access to patients and physicians.\n● Active business development initiative. Business development plays a vital role in our growth strategy as we look to build scale. We consistently\nevaluate both synergistic acquisitions that leverage our existing infrastructure, as well as more transformative assets that would require building out\nor restructuring our field sales force. We have extensive relationships in the industry that help us stay abreast of developments in our space and\ncontinually monitor new opportunities. We believe that we are an ideal partner for development stage companies with limited or no commercial\ncapabilities, as well as established pharmaceutical companies looking to deprioritize their dermatology portfolio. We regularly engage in discussions\nwith an array of companies, including traditional large pharma, mid-size specialty pharma companies and smaller companies that focus on research\nand development, although we have not entered into any definitive agreements or arrangements. Another important part of our business\ndevelopment strategy is to continue to out-license our branded products and/or proprietary technologies in global markets.\n12\nTable of Contents\nMajor Customers\nWe primarily sell our prescription products to specialty pharmacies, independent wholesalers, and distributors with limited sales through the traditional\nnational wholesaler channels. Our wholesalers and distributors purchase products from us and, in turn, supply products to retail drug store chains,\nindependent pharmacies and managed care organizations. Customers in the managed care market include health maintenance organizations, group\npurchasing organizations, nursing homes, clinics, pharmacy benefit management companies and mail order customers.\nLicense & Collaboration Agreements and Acquisitions\nWe continue to seek to enhance our product line and develop a balanced portfolio of differentiated products through product acquisitions and in-licensing or\nacquiring rights to products and technologies from third parties. We intend to enter into strategic alliances and collaborative arrangements with third parties,\nwhich will give us rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or commercialize pharmaceutical products, the rights to which are primarily owned by these\nthird parties. These alliances and arrangements can take many forms, including licensing arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements, co-\npromotion arrangements, research collaborations and joint ventures. Such alliances and arrangements will potentially enable us to share the risk of incurring\nall research and development expenses that do not lead to revenue-generating products. However, because profits from alliance products are shared with the\ncounterparties to the collaborative arrangement, the gross margins on alliance products are generally lower, sometimes substantially so, than the gross\nmargins that could be achieved had we not opted for a development partner. From time to time, we may also seek to grant licenses or sublicenses of rights to\ndevelop, sell and distribute our products to third parties in exchange for the payment of license fees and/or royalty payments.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur operations are subject to substantial federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, the generation,\nhandling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous substances. Violation of these laws and regulations, which may\nchange, can lead to substantial fines and penalties. Many of our third-party operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and limit\npollution of the environment. We believe that the facilities of our third-party service providers are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental\nlaws and regulations, and we do not believe that future compliance costs will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations or cash flows.\nEmployees and Human Capital Management\nWe currently employ 58 individuals, all of whom are full-time employees. We have 41 employees in sales and marketing, 14 employees in general and\nadministrative positions, and 3 employees in research and development positions. Additionally, we have retained a number of expert advisors and\nconsultants that help us navigate through different aspects of our business. We consider our relations with our employees to be good and have not\nexperienced any work stoppages, slowdowns or other serious labor problems that have materially impeded our business operations.\nOur human capital management objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our new and existing\nemployees. The principal purpose of our equity incentive plan is to attract, retain, and motivate selected employees, consultants, and directors through the\ngranting of share-based compensation awards and cash-based bonus awards.\nGeographic Areas\nAll of our product revenues are generated from operations or otherwise earned within the U.S. We are entitled to receive commercial milestones payments\nfrom Maruho, our exclusive licensing partner in Japan, based on certain net sales achievements for Rapifort® Wipes 2.5% (Qbrexza®), for the treatment of\nprimary axillary hyperhidrosis. We also received a one-time upfront license payment totaling $19.0 million from Maruho during 2023 under the New\nLicense Agreement in which we granted Maruho exclusive rights to Qbrexza in Korea and other Asian countries.\n13\nTable of Contents\nSeasonality of Business\nOur business is affected by the standard annual insurance deductible resets, as well as the purchasing patterns and concentration of our customers; however,\nour business is not materially impacted by seasonality. There are no assurances that these historical trends will continue in the future.\nRelationship with Fortress\nGeneral\nFortress is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to acquiring, developing and commercializing pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and product\ncandidates at its majority-owned and majority-controlled subsidiaries and joint ventures, and at entities founded by Fortress and in which it maintains\nsignificant minority ownership positions. Fortress has a talented and experienced business development team, comprised of scientists, doctors, and finance\nprofessionals, who identify, evaluate, and propose for our consideration promising products and product candidates. We have a nine-year operating history\nand we are a majority owned subsidiary of Fortress.\nProduct Licensing Agreements and Asset Acquisitions\nRapifort® Wipes 2.5% (Qbrexza)\nOn August 31, 2023, we entered into the New License Agreement with Maruho, whereby we granted an exclusive license to Maruho to develop and\ncommercialize Qbrexza® for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in the Territory. Under the terms of the New License Agreement, in exchange\nfor the exclusive rights to Qbrexza in the Territory, Maruho paid $19.0 million as a non-refundable upfront payment.\nOn February 11, 2022, we announced that Maruho received marketing and manufacturing approval for Rapifort Wipes 2.5% (Qbrexza), for the treatment of\nprimary axillary hyperhidrosis, triggering a net $2.5 million milestone payment to us. The net payment reflected a milestone payment of $10.0 million to us\nfrom our exclusive licensing partner in Maruho, offset by a $7.5 million payment to Dermira, pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement between\nus and Dermira. In conjunction with the terms of the licensing agreement with Maruho, the milestone payment was due from Maruho within 30 days of the\napproval. We acquired global rights to Qbrexza from Dermira in 2021.\nAmzeeq, Zilxi, FCD105 and the Molecule Stabilizing Technology Platform\nOn January 12, 2022, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “APA”) with Vyne Therapeutics Inc. (“Vyne”) to acquire Vyne’s Molecule\nStabilizing Technology™ franchise (the “Acquisition”) for an upfront payment of $20.0 million, with an additional $5.0 million payment due on the one-\nyear anniversary of the closing of the Acquisition. The APA also provides for contingent net sales milestone payments: in the first calendar year in which\nannual sales reach each of $100 million, $200 million, $300 million, $400 million and $500 million, we will be required to make a one-time payment of $10\nmillion, $20 million, $30 million, $40 million and $50 million, respectively, in that year only, per product, totaling up to $450.0 million. In addition,\nJourney will pay Vyne 10% of any upfront payment received by Journey from a licensee or sublicensee of the products in any territory outside of the United\nStates, subject to exceptions for certain jurisdictions as detailed in the APA. There are no subsequent milestone payments or royalties beyond the\naforementioned payments. The Acquisition included two FDA-approved products (Amzeeq® and Zilxi®), and a development-stage dermatology program\n(FCD105), along with the Molecule Stabilizing Technology proprietary platform.\n14\nTable of Contents\nDFD-29 Agreement\nOn June 29, 2021, we entered into a license, collaboration, and assignment agreement with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. (“DRL”) to obtain the global\nrights for the development and commercialization of DFD-29, a late-stage development modified release oral minocycline that is being evaluated for the\ntreatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea (the “DFD-29 Agreement”). We acquired global rights to DFD-29, including in the U.S. and Europe, except\nthat DRL has retained certain rights to the program in select markets including Brazil, Russia, India, China and the Commonwealth of Independent States\n(“CIS”) countries. Pursuant to the DFD-29 Agreement, we agreed to make an upfront payment of $10.0 million, comprised of a $2.0 million payment upon\nexecution and $8.0 million which was paid on September 29, 2021, 90 days following execution, with additional contingent regulatory, commercial, and\ncorporate-based milestone payments, totaling up to $158.0 million. Royalties ranging from ten percent to twenty percent are payable on net sales of the\nproduct. Royalties are payable in each country until the last-to-expire patent in such country expires. Royalties are subject to a 50% reduction in the event\nthat a generic competitor launches in an applicable country where we market and sell the product. We are responsible for the prosecution and enforcement\nof patents licensed under the DFD-29 Agreement. The DFD-29 Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and indemnities, and title\ntransfers to us on the date of achievement of certain regulatory milestones set forth in the agreement, after which our licenses become our acquired assets.\nEach party may also terminate the DFD-29 Agreement for material breach by the other party or for certain bankruptcy or insolvency related events.\nAdditionally, we agreed to fund and oversee the Phase III clinical trials. From inception to date we have incurred approximately $23.8 million in costs\nassociated with the development of DFD-29.\nThe DFD-29 Agreement will remain in effect on a country-by-county basis until the expiration of the revenue percentage term in the relevant country,\nwhich period begins on the first commercial sale of a product in that country and ends upon the expiration or invalidation date of the last revenue generating\npatent in such country. The DFD-29 Agreement terminates in its entirety upon the expiry of the revenue percentage term in the last country covered under\nthe DFD-29 Agreement.\nQbrexza Agreement\nOn March 31, 2021, we executed an asset purchase agreement for Qbrexza® (the “Qbrexza APA”) with Dermira Inc. (“Dermira”), pursuant to which we\nacquired global ownership to Qbrexza (glycopyrronium), a prescription cloth towelette approved to treat primary axillary hyperhidrosis in people nine years\nof age and older. The transaction closed on May 14, 2021, and pursuant to the Qbrexza APA, we made an upfront $12.5 million cash payment to Dermira.\nWe are obligated to make payments to Dermira of up to $144.0 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain milestones. For the first two years,\nwe were required to pay royalties on sales ranging from the mid-thirty to the mid-twenty percent. Thereafter, we are required to pay royalties on Qbrexza\nnet sales ranging from the lower teen digits to the upper teen digits, which are payable for a period of eight years ending in 2029, subject to certain\nreductions. The Qbrexza APA contains customary representations, warranties, and indemnities. Each party may also terminate the Qbrexza APA for\nmaterial breach by the other party.\nAs part of the Qbrexza APA, we were assigned an exclusive license agreement with Rose University (“Rose U”) pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide\nexclusive license within a field of use including hyperhidrosis to practice, enforce and otherwise exploit certain patent rights, know-how and data related to\nQbrexza. The license agreement with Rose U includes a sublicense of certain data and an assignment of certain regulatory filings which Rose U had\nobtained from Stiefel Laboratories (“Stiefel”). In connection with the license agreement, we assumed Rose U’s obligations to Stiefel to use commercially\nreasonable efforts to develop and commercialize products using the licensed patent rights, know-how and data.\nPursuant to these agreements with Rose U and the related agreement with Stiefel with respect to Qbrexza, we are obligated to pay Rose U low-to-mid\nsingle-digit royalties on net product sales and low double-digit royalties on sublicense fees and certain milestone, royalty and other contingent payments\nreceived from sublicensees, to the extent such amounts are in excess of the milestone and royalty payments we are obligated to pay Rose U directly upon\nthe events or sales triggering such payments.\n15\nTable of Contents\nWe are permitted to grant sublicenses to the licensed rights and may assign the agreements upon our acquisition or that of our assets that relate to the\nlicense agreement. We may terminate the license agreement if Rose U experiences certain insolvency events or if Rose U commits a material breach of the\nlicense agreement, subject to applicable cure provisions. Rose U may terminate the license in certain circumstances if we experience certain insolvency\nevents or if we commit a material breach of the license agreement or if we cause Rose U to be in material breach of its license agreement with Stiefel,\nsubject in each case to applicable cure provisions. Subject to earlier termination, the license agreement remains in effect until 15 years following the first\ncommercial sale of a licensed product have elapsed or, if later, the date that the last patent or patent application in the licensed patent rights has expired or\nbeen revoked, invalidated or abandoned. As of December 31, 2023, the last-to-expire issued patent relating to Qbrexza that we license under the license\nagreement with Rose U expires in 2029.\nAccutane Agreement\nOn July 29, 2020, we entered into a license and supply agreement for Accutane® (the “Accutane Agreement”) with DRL. Pursuant to the Accutane\nAgreement, we agreed to pay $5.0 million, comprised of an upfront payment of $1.0 million paid upon execution, with additional milestone payments\ntotaling $4.0 million. To date, we have paid all of the additional milestone payments. Three additional milestone payments totaling $17.0 million are\ncontingent upon the achievement of certain net sales milestones. Royalties in the low-double digits based on net sales, subject to specified reductions, are\nalso due.\nThe term of the Accutane Agreement is ten years and renewable upon mutual agreement. The agreement contains customary representations, warranties,\nand indemnities. Each party may also terminate the Accutane Agreement for material breach by the other party or for certain bankruptcy or insolvency\nrelated events and we may terminate for upon 180 days written notice to the other party. We commenced sales of this product in April 2021.\nAnti-Itch Product Agreement\nOn December 18, 2020, we entered into an asset purchase agreement for our Anti-itch Product (the “Anti-itch APA”) with Sun Pharmaceutical Industries,\nInc. (“Sun”). Pursuant to the Anti-itch APA, total consideration is $4.0 million, comprised of an upfront payment of $2.0 million, payable upon execution.\nThrough December 31, 2023, we have paid $4.0 million and have no additional payment obligations. The Anti-itch APA contains customary\nrepresentations, warranties, and indemnities. There are no subsequent milestone payments or royalties beyond the aforementioned payments. We intend to\nlaunch this product during the second half of 2024 or first half of 2025.\nXimino Agreement\nOn July 22, 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement for Ximino® (the “Ximino APA”) with Sun. Pursuant to the Ximino APA, total\nconsideration is $9.4 million, with an upfront payment of $2.4 million, which was payable within 60 days after execution on September 22, 2019.\nPursuant to the terms of the Ximino APA, the remaining $7.0 million is due on the second anniversary and for the next four anniversaries of the Ximino\nAPA thereafter. In addition, we are obligated to pay royalties in the mid-single digits based on net sales of Ximino, subject to specified reductions until the\nend of 2022. The Ximino APA contains customary representations, warranties, and indemnities. Each party may also terminate the Ximino APA for\nmaterial breach by the other party or for certain bankruptcy or insolvency related events. No additional licensing or milestone payments are required. We\ncommenced sales of this product in August 2019. We discontinued selling Ximino in September 2023.\nExelderm Agreement\nOn August 31, 2018, we entered into an asset purchase agreement for Exelderm® (the “Exelderm APA”) with Sun. Pursuant to the Exelderm APA, total\nconsideration is $1.6 million, comprised of an upfront payment of $1.2 million, which was payable within 60 days after execution on October 31, 2018. The\nremaining milestone payment was contingent upon net sales reaching a certain threshold, at which point a $0.4 million payment became due. This threshold\nwas achieved in 2020 and paid in early 2021. We were obligated to pay royalties in the low-double digits based on net sales of Exelderm until the end of\n2023, and no additional licensing or milestone payments are required. We commenced sales of this product in August 2018.\n16\nTable of Contents\nTargadox Agreement\nOn March 10, 2015, we entered into a license and supply agreement (as amended) for Targadox® (the “Targadox Agreement”) with PuraCap International\nLLC n/k/a Caribe Holdings, Inc. (“Caribe”). We made an upfront payment of $1.3 million. Further payments will be made based on a revenue sharing\narrangement and no additional licensing or milestone payments are required. The term of the Targadox Agreement is ten years and automatically renews for\nthree-year periods unless either party provides notice of its intent not to renew at least 180 days prior to the expiration of the applicable term. Under our\nrevenue sharing arrangement, we are entitled to retain a majority of the net profits and pay Caribe a portion of the net profits after deducting certain\ncommercial, marketing and sales expenses during the term of the Targadox Agreement. The Targadox Agreement contains customary representations,\nwarranties, and indemnities. Each party may also terminate the Targadox Agreement for material breach by the other party or for certain bankruptcy or\ninsolvency related events. We commenced sales of this product in October 2016.\nResearch and Development\nAs discussed above, on June 29, 2021, we obtained the global rights from DRL for the development and commercialization of DFD-29, a late-stage\ndevelopment modified release oral minocycline that is being developed for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea. Through this collaboration, the\nparties were required to work together to complete the development of DFD-29, which included conducting two Phase III studies to assess the efficacy,\nsafety and tolerability of oral DFD-29 for the treatment of rosacea and the January 4, 2024 regulatory submission of an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the\nFDCA. DRL provided development support, including responding to any requests for information or clarification from FDA regarding the NDA.\nOn March 17, 2022, we dosed the first patient in our Phase III clinical trials evaluating DFD-29 (Minocycline Modified Release Capsules 40 mg) for the\nTreatment of Rosacea. We filed the NDA with the FDA on January 4, 2024. The two Phase III studies conducted in the US and Germany demonstrated that\nDFD-29 was statistically superior to Oracea® and Placebo on multiple efficacy endpoints relevant to the treatment of rosacea. DFD-29 also demonstrated\nstatistical superiority to Placebo in reducing erythema of rosacea. The safety profile of DFD-29 in the two Phase III studies was similar to Placebo. Based\non the Phase III data, we are seeking an indication to treat inflammatory lesions and erythema of rosacea in patients 18 years of age and older for DFD-29.\nIntellectual Property\nGeneral\nWe rely on a combination of contractual provisions, confidentiality policies and procedures and patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrecy laws to\nprotect the proprietary aspects of our technology and business. Three of our marketed products, Accutane, Targadox, and Exelderm, do not have patent\nprotection and/or are not otherwise eligible for patent protection. As part of our development and acquisition strategy, we place a strong emphasis on the\npatent protection for potential products.\nThree of our marketed products, Qbrexza, Amzeeq, and Zilxi, as well as DFD-29, currently have patent protection.\n17\nTable of Contents\nQbrexza Patents\nWe own or have an exclusive license to twenty two issued U.S. patents and forty one issued foreign patents, which include granted European patent rights\nthat have been validated in selected European Patent Organization (“EPO”) member states (Switzerland, Germany, Spain, France, Great Britain, Ireland,\nand Italy), Australia, Canada, Mexico, Israel, Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, and New Zealand, Singapore, and South Africa, and six pending U.S. patent\napplications, one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty application, and sixteen pending foreign patent applications. Of these patents and patent applications:\nThere are eighteen issued U.S. patents, thirty seven issued foreign patents (AU, CA, selected EP member states, Mexico, Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, New\nZealand, Singapore, and South Africa), two pending U.S. patent applications and three pending foreign applications (in Israel and Hong Kong), all relating\nto Qbrexza. We own fourteen of the issued U.S. patents, both of the pending U.S. patent applications, twenty of the issued foreign patents, and two of the\npending foreign applications, and have exclusively licensed from Rose U worldwide rights to four of the issued U.S. patents, seventeen issued foreign\npatents, and one pending foreign patent applications. The issued Qbrexza patents contain claims directed to individually packaged wipes for the treatment of\nhyperhidrosis where the wipes contain a composition comprising Qbrexza or other related compounds, and methods of alleviating hyperhidrosis using such\ncompositions and contain claims directed to compositions comprising Qbrexza or other related compounds, individually packaged wipes comprising such\ncompositions, absorbent pads comprising Qbrexza pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treating hyperhidrosis with topical administration of\nQbrexza or other related compounds. The issued U.S. and foreign patents relating to Qbrexza will expire between 2028 and 2033 and the pending U.S. and\nforeign patent applications relating to Qbrexza, if issued, will expire between 2028 and 2034.\nAmzeeq, Zilxi & the Molecular Stabilizing Technology Platform Patents\nWe own thirty nine issued U.S. patents and twenty issued foreign patents, and nine pending U.S. patent applications, and two pending foreign patent\napplications. Of these patents and patent applications:\n● There are twenty one issued U.S. patents, fifteen issued foreign patents (Australia, Canada, Europe, Israel, Mexico, United Kingdom, South Africa),\nsix pending U.S. patent applications and one pending foreign application (Canada), all relating to Amzeeq. The issued Amzeeq patents contain\nclaims directed to compositions and use of the compositions (method claims). The issued U.S. and foreign patents relating to Amzeeq will expire\nbetween 2030 and 2037 and the pending U.S. and foreign patent applications relating to Amzeeq will expire between 2030 and 2037.\n● There are fourteen issued U.S. patents, fifteen issued foreign patents (Australia, Canada, Europe, Israel, Mexico, United Kingdom, South Africa),\nfour pending U.S. patent applications and one pending foreign application (Canada), all relating to Zilxi. The issued Zilxi patents contain claims\ndirected to compositions and use of the compositions (method claims). The issued U.S. and foreign patents relating to Zilxi will expire between\n2030 and 2037 and the pending U.S. and foreign patent applications relating to Zilxi will expire between 2030 and 2037.\n● The other patents related to molecular stabilizing platform but not products directly are sixteen issued U.S. patents, three pending U.S. patent\napplications, and five issued foreign patents (Canada, Israel, and Mexico).\nDFD-29 Patents\nWith regard to DFD-29, we have an exclusive license to one U.S. patent family including three issued U.S. patents and one U.S. continuation application, as\nwell as one issued foreign patent (Mexico) and eight foreign pending patent applications (one in each of Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, Korea, and\nSouth Africa; and two in New Zealand) covering methods of treating an inflammatory skin condition by selecting and administering an oral composition\ncomprising reduced dose of minocycline and the relevant pharmacokinetic parameters, and we intend to pursue composition-of-matter patents, where\npossible, and dosage and formulation patents, as well as method-of-use patents on novel indications for known compounds. The three issued U.S. patents\nwill expire in 2039.\n18\nTable of Contents\nAdditional Intellectual Property and Proprietary Right Protection\nWe also use other forms of protection, such as trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection, to protect our intellectual property, particularly where we\ndo not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. We aim to take advantage of all of the intellectual property rights that are available to us and\nbelieve that this comprehensive approach will provide us with proprietary positions for our product candidates, where available. Patents extend for varying\nperiods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual\nprotection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of\nlegal remedies in the country.\nOur goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, to\npreserve our trade secrets, and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our\npolicy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for any product candidates, proprietary\ninformation and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.\nPatents and other proprietary rights are crucial to the development of our business. We will be able to protect our proprietary technologies from\nunauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents, supported by regulatory\nexclusivity, or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.\nGenerally, patent applications in the U.S. are maintained in secrecy for a period of 18 months or more. The patent positions of biotechnology and\npharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Therefore, we cannot predict the breadth of claims allowed\nin biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents, or their enforceability. To date, there has been no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in\nbiotechnology patents. Third parties or competitors may challenge or circumvent our patents or patent applications, if issued. If our competitors prepare and\nfile patent applications in the U.S. that claim technology also claimed by us, we may have to participate in derivation proceedings declared by the USPTO to\ndetermine proper inventorship of a claimed of invention, which could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Because of\nthe extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that before we commercialize any of our\nproducts, any related patent may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization, thus reducing any advantage of the\npatent. However, the life of a patent covering a product that has been subject to regulatory approval may be extended through the patent term restoration\nprogram, although any such extension could still be minimal.\nIf a patent is issued to a third party containing one or more preclusive or conflicting claims, and those claims are ultimately determined to be valid and\nenforceable, we may be required to obtain a license under such patent or to develop or obtain alternative technology, neither of which may be possible. In\nthe event of litigation involving a third-party claim, an adverse outcome in the litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to such third party, require\nus to seek a license under the disputed rights of such third party, and/or require us to cease use of the technology. Moreover, our breach of an existing\nlicense or failure to obtain a license to technology required to commercialize our products may seriously harm our business. We also may need to\ncommence litigation to enforce any patents issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. Litigation could involve\nsubstantial costs.\nOther Intellectual Property Rights\nWe depend upon trademarks, trade secrets, and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position. We also depend upon\nthe skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. This\nknowledge and experience we call “know-how.” To help protect our proprietary know-how that is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may\nbe difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all employees,\nscientific advisors, consultants, collaborators and other contractors, upon commencement of a relationship with us, to enter into confidentiality agreements,\nwhich prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, in the case of parties other than our research and development collaborators, require\ndisclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. These agreements are designed to protect\nour proprietary information and to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed in connection with their relationship with us. These agreements\nmay not, however, provide protection for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information.\n19\nTable of Contents\nThere can be no assurance that any of our patents, licenses or other intellectual property rights will afford us any protection from competition, that our\nconfidentiality agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop equivalent\nproprietary information or that other third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and other intellectual property.\nWe may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights, to protect our intellectual property or trade secrets or to determine the scope and\nvalidity of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation is costly and time-consuming and there can be no assurance that our litigation expenses will not be\nsignificant in the future or that we will prevail in any such litigation.\nCompetition\nPharmaceutical Industry\nOur competitors include pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and public and private research institutions. In\naddition, companies that are active in different but related fields represent substantial competition for us. Many of our competitors have significantly\ngreater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities and greater experience in drug development, regulation, manufacturing and\nmarketing than we do. These organizations also compete with us to recruit qualified personnel, attract partners for joint ventures or other collaborations, and\nlicense technologies that are competitive with ours. To compete successfully in this industry, we must identify novel and unique drugs or methods of\ntreatment and then complete the development of those drugs as treatments in advance of our competitors.\nDermatology Sector\nThe dermatology competitive landscape is highly fragmented, with a large number of midsize and smaller companies competing in both the prescription\nsector and the OTC sector. Our competitors are pursuing the development and/or acquisition of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and OTC products that\ntarget the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting in dermatology. Competitive factors vary by product line and geographic area in which our\nproducts are sold. The principal methods of competition for our products include quality, efficacy, market acceptance, price, and marketing and promotional\nefforts.\nBranded products often must compete with therapeutically similar branded or generic products or with generic equivalents. Such competition frequently\nincreases over time. For example, if competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products\ncould be subject to progressive price reductions and/or decreased volume of sales. To successfully compete for business, we must often demonstrate that\nour products offer not only medical benefits, but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care. Accordingly, we face pressure to continually\nseek out technological innovations and to market our products effectively.\nOur major competitors, including Galderma Laboratories, Almirall, Novan Therapeutics, Leo Pharma, Mayne Pharma, Botanix Pharmaceuticals, and Ortho\nDermatologics, among others, vary depending on therapeutic and product category, dosage strength and drug-delivery systems, among other factors.\nGeneric Competition\nWe face increased competition from manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products, who may submit applications to the FDA seeking to market generic\nversions of our products. In connection with these applications, the generic drug companies may seek to challenge the validity and enforceability of our\npatents through litigation. When patents covering certain of our products (if applicable) expire or are successfully challenged through litigation or in\nUSPTO proceedings, if a generic company launches a competing product “at risk,” or when the regulatory or licensed exclusivity for our products (if\napplicable) expires or is otherwise lost, we may face generic competition as a result. Generic versions are generally significantly less expensive than\nbranded versions, and, where available, may be required to be utilized before or in preference to the branded version under third-party reimbursement\nprograms, or substituted by pharmacies. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from\ngeneric forms of the product. To successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations, we must often\ndemonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits, but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care. Generic products generally\nface intense competition from other generic equivalents (including authorized generics) and therapeutically similar branded or generic products.\n20\nTable of Contents\nSupply and Manufacturing\nWe have limited experience in manufacturing products for clinical or commercial purposes, and we currently do not have any internal manufacturing\ncapabilities. We currently rely upon multiple contract manufacturers to produce our products and clinical supply of product candidates and will continue to\nrely upon contract manufacturers for any current or future product candidates under current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations for use in\npre-clinical and clinical activities. Due to the risks associated with reliance on third-party manufacturing, as part of our current and future strategy of\nlicensing, acquiring, or the future development of assets, we currently, and will continue to, secure manufacturing agreements with either a counterparty to a\ntransaction, with one or more of our contract manufacturers or additional contract manufacturers. As with any supply program, obtaining raw materials of\nthe correct quality cannot be guaranteed, and we cannot ensure that we will be successful. Our third-party manufacturers have a limited number of facilities\nin which our product candidates can be produced and may have limited experience in manufacturing our product candidates in quantities sufficient for\ncommercialization. Our third-party manufacturers will have other clients and may have other priorities that could affect their ability to perform the work\nsatisfactorily and/or on a timely basis. Both of these occurrences would be beyond our control. We expect to similarly rely on contract manufacturing\nrelationships for any products that we may in-license or acquire in the future. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully\ncontract with such manufacturers on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nContract manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic and unannounced inspections by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration and corresponding\nstate and European agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMPs and other state and federal regulations. We do not have control over third-party\nmanufacturers’ compliance with these regulations and standards, other than through contractual obligations. If they are deemed out of compliance with\ncGMPs, product recalls could result, inventory could be destroyed, production could be stopped, and supplies could be delayed or otherwise disrupted.\nIf we need to change manufacturers during the clinical or development stage for product candidates or after commercialization for our approved products,\nthe FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies must approve these new manufacturers in advance, which will involve testing and additional\ninspections to ensure compliance with FDA regulations and standards and may require significant lead times and delay. Furthermore, switching\nmanufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited. It may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement\nmanufacturer quickly or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nGovernment and Industry Regulations - Overview\nFDA Regulations\nNumerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies, impose substantial regulations upon any\npotential clinical development and the manufacture and marketing of our products. Before marketing in the U.S., any drug that we may develop must\nundergo rigorous pre-clinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the FDA under the FDCA. The FDA\nregulates, among other things, the pre-clinical and clinical testing, safety, efficacy, approval, manufacturing, record keeping, lot traceability, individual\nserialization, adverse event reporting, packaging, labeling, storage, advertising, promotion, export, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products.\nThe regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. In the event that we acquire or develop a clinical stage asset, we will be\nrequired to submit extensive pre-clinical and clinical data and supporting information to the FDA for each indication or use to establish a product\ncandidate’s safety and efficacy before we can secure FDA approval to market or sell a product in the U.S. The approval process may take many years,\ndepending on the stage of development of a target asset, and requires the expenditure of substantial resources and may involve ongoing requirements for\npost-marketing studies or surveillance.\nClinical testing must meet requirements for institutional review board oversight, informed consent and good clinical practices, and must be conducted\npursuant to an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) Application unless exempted.\n21\nTable of Contents\nFor purposes of NDA approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases:\nPhase 1:\n➢The drug is administered to a small group of humans, either healthy volunteers or patients, to test for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption,\nmetabolism, excretion and clinical pharmacology.\nPhase 2:\n➢Studies are conducted on a larger number of patients to assess the efficacy of the product, to ascertain dose tolerance and the optimal dose range,\nand to gather additional data relating to safety and potential adverse events.\nPhase 3:\n➢Studies establish safety and efficacy in an expanded patient population.\nPhase 4:\n➢The FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to find out more about the drug’s long-term risks, benefits, and optimal use, or to test the\ndrug in different populations.\nThe length of time necessary to complete clinical trials varies significantly and may be difficult to predict. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to\nvarying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. Additional factors that can cause delay or termination in future clinical trials,\nor that may increase the costs of these trials, include:\n● slow patient enrollment due to the nature of the clinical trial plan, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for participation in\nthe study or other factors;\n● inadequately trained or insufficient personnel at the study site to assist in overseeing and monitoring clinical trials or delays in approvals from a\nstudy site’s review board;\n● longer treatment time required to demonstrate efficacy or determine the appropriate product dose;\n● insufficient supply of the drug candidates;\n● adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients; and\n● ineffectiveness of the drug candidates.\nIn addition, the FDA, equivalent foreign regulatory authority, or a data safety monitoring committee for a trial may place a clinical trial on hold or terminate\nit if it concludes that subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, or for futility. Any drug is likely to produce some toxicity or undesirable\nside effects in animals and in humans when administered at sufficiently high doses and/or for a sufficiently long period of time. Unacceptable toxicity or\nside effects may occur at any dose level at any time in the course of studies in animals designed to identify unacceptable effects of a drug candidate, known\nas toxicological studies, or clinical trials of drug candidates. The appearance of any unacceptable toxicity or side effect could cause us or regulatory\nauthorities to interrupt, limit, delay or abort the development of any of our drug candidates and could ultimately prevent approval by the FDA or foreign\nregulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications.\nSponsors of drugs may apply for a special protocol assessment (“SPA”) from the FDA. The SPA process is a procedure by which the FDA provides official\nevaluation and written guidance on the design and size of proposed protocols that are intended to form the basis for an NDA. However, final marketing\napproval depends on the results of efficacy, the adverse event profile and an evaluation of the benefit/risk of treatment demonstrated in the Phase 3 trial. The\nSPA agreement may only be changed through a written agreement between the sponsor and the FDA, or if the FDA becomes aware of a substantial\nscientific issue essential to product safety or efficacy.\n22\nTable of Contents\nBefore receiving FDA approval to market a product, we must demonstrate that the product is safe and effective for its intended use by submitting to the\nFDA an NDA, Abbreviated NDA (“ANDA”), 510(K) or Biologics License Application (“BLA”) containing the pre-clinical and clinical data that have been\naccumulated, together with chemistry and manufacturing and controls specifications and information, and proposed labeling, among other things. The FDA\nmay refuse to accept an NDA, ANDA, 510(K) or BLA for filing if certain content criteria are not met and, even after accepting an NDA, ANDA, 510(K) or\nBLA, the FDA may often require additional information, including clinical data, before approval of marketing a product.\nSection 505(b)(2) NDAs may provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products.\nSection 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from clinical trials not conducted by, or\nfor, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some,\nof the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.\nTo the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for an already approved product, the applicant\nis required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant\nwould. Thus approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired; until any non-\npatent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a New Chemical Entity (“NCE”), listed in its publication “Approved Drug Products with\nTherapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book,” for the referenced product has expired; and, in the case of a Paragraph IV\ncertification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is\nfavorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. In the interim period, the FDA may grant tentative approval. Tentative approval indicates that the FDA has\ndetermined that the applicant meets the standards for approval as of the date that the tentative approval is granted. Final regulatory approval can only be\ngranted if the FDA is assured that there is no new information that would affect final regulatory/ approval.\nThe FDA may request a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), as part of an NDA, ANDA, 510(K) or BLA. The REMS typically contains\nsome combination of post-marketing obligations of the sponsor to train prescribing physicians, monitor drug use, including off-label use, and conduct\nsufficient Phase 4 follow-up studies and registries to ensure the continued safe use of the drug.\nAs part of the approval process, the FDA must inspect and approve each manufacturing facility. Among the conditions of approval is the requirement that a\nmanufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP. Manufacturers must expend significant time, money and effort to ensure\ncontinued compliance, and the FDA conducts periodic inspections to certify compliance. It may be difficult for our manufacturers or us to comply with the\napplicable cGMPs, as interpreted by the FDA, and other FDA regulatory requirements. If we, or our contract manufacturers, fail to comply, then the FDA\nmay not allow us to market products that have been affected by the failure.\nIf the FDA grants approval, the approval will be limited to those conditions and patient populations for which the product is safe and effective, as\ndemonstrated through clinical studies. Further, a product may be marketed only in those dosage forms and for those indications approved in the NDA,\nANDA, 510(K), or BLA. Certain changes to an approved BLA, including, with certain exceptions, any significant changes to labeling, require approval of a\nsupplemental application before the drug may be marketed as changed. Any products that we manufacture or distribute pursuant to FDA approvals are\nsubject to continuing monitoring and regulation by the FDA, including compliance with cGMP and the reporting of adverse experiences with the drugs. The\nnature of marketing claims that the FDA will permit us to make in the labeling and advertising of our products will generally be limited to those specified in\nFDA approved labeling, and the advertising of our products will be subject to comprehensive monitoring and regulation by the FDA. Drugs whose review\nwas accelerated may carry additional restrictions on marketing activities, including the requirement that all promotional materials are pre-submitted to the\nFDA. Claims exceeding those contained in approved labeling will constitute a violation of the FDCA. Violations of the FDCA or regulatory requirements at\nany time during the product development process, approval process, or marketing and sale following approval may result in agency enforcement actions,\nincluding withdrawal of approval, recall, seizure of products, warning letters, untitled letters, Form 483s, injunctions, fines and/or civil or criminal\npenalties. Any agency enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n23\nTable of Contents\nPharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement\nSales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and\nforeign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by\nthird-party payors. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any newly approved product. Decisions regarding the\nextent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular\nproduct does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. As a result, the coverage determination process can require\nmanufacturers to provide scientific details, information on cost-effectiveness, and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately. This can\nbe a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.\nIn addition, third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for pharmaceutical products and related services. The U.S. government and state\nlegislatures have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and\nrequirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and\nreviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-\ncontainment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any\nproduct. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage\nand patient demand for the product.\nAt the state level, there are also new laws and ongoing ballot initiatives that create additional pressure on drug pricing and may affect how pharmaceutical\nproducts are covered and reimbursed. A number of states have adopted or are considering various pricing actions, such as those requiring pharmaceutical\nmanufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information, limit price increases or to place a maximum price ceiling or cap on certain products.\nExisting and proposed state pricing laws have added complexity to the pricing of pharmaceutical drug products.\nIn international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on\nspecific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for\nwhich their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may\napprove a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing\nthe medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price\ncontrols on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products. Furthermore, there is no assurance that a product will be\nconsidered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that it will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate\nlevel of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available, or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the\nability for manufacturers to sell products profitably.\nInternational Regulations\nIn addition to regulations in the United States, there are a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of\nany product candidates. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.\nFailure to comply with applicable federal, state and foreign laws and regulations would likely have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition,\nfederal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of new drugs are subject to future changes.\nPHRMA Code and April 3, 2003 Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, OIG Compliance Program for Pharmaceutical\nManufacturers\nWe have established and implemented a corporate compliance program designed to prevent, detect and correct violations of state and federal healthcare\nlaws, including laws related to advertising and promotion of our products that are in compliance with the PHRMA Code and the Health and Human\nServices Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) Compliance Program requirements for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers.\n24\nTable of Contents\nHealthcare Fraud, Waste and Abuse\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, violations of which can lead to civil and criminal\npenalties, including fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.\nThese laws are applicable to us as both a manufacturer and a supplier of products reimbursed by federal healthcare programs, and they also apply to\nphysicians and other potential purchasers of our products.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b) prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing\nremuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending or arranging for a good or service, for\nwhich payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Remuneration is not defined in the federal\nAnti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, coupons, the furnishing of\nsupplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market\nvalue. Under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b, a person or\nentity need not have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may\nassert that a claim, including items or services resulting from a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the\ncivil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes fines against any person who is determined to have\npresented or caused to be presented claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not\nprovided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute and implementing regulations provide for certain exceptions for “safe\nharbors” for certain discounting, rebating or personal services arrangements, among other things. However, the lack of uniform court interpretation of the\nAnti-Kickback Statute, coupled with novel enforcement theories by government authorities, make compliance with the law difficult. Violations of the\nfederal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in significant criminal fines, exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid and follow-on civil litigation,\namong other things, for both entities and individuals.\nIn October 2019, the OIG issued a proposed rule to, among other things, add new safe harbors for certain value-based arrangements. Although the value-\nbased proposals would not include pharmaceutical manufacturers among the entities that could permissibly enter into such contracting arrangements, the\ngeneral trend toward outcomes and value-based contracts in the healthcare industry may continue. It is possible that payors, among other customers, could\npush manufacturers for novel contracting approaches, including those that would incorporate value-based principles, and these efforts could affect our\nbusiness.\nThe civil False Claims Act and similar state laws impose liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be\npresented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act and similar state laws\nallow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal or state government and to share in any monetary recovery. The Federal Physician\nPayments Sunshine Act and similar state laws impose reporting requirements for various types of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals. Failure to\ncomply with reporting requirements under these laws could subject manufacturers and others to substantial civil money penalties.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) imposes criminal liability and amends provisions on the reporting,\ninvestigation, enforcement, and penalizing of civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme\nto defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false\nstatement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services by a healthcare benefit program, which includes both\ngovernment and privately funded benefits programs; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge\nof the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.\nOther Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements\nIn the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the United States Department of\nHealth and Human Services, the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and\nstate and local governments.\n25\nTable of Contents\nDrug Quality and Security Act (“DQSA”)\nDQSA was enacted by Congress on November 27, 2013. Title II of DQSA, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (“DSCSA”), outlines steps to build an\nelectronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States. This is intended to enhance the\nFDA’s ability to help protect consumers from exposure to drugs that may be counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful. The system is also\nintended to improve detection and removal of potentially dangerous drugs from the drug supply chain to protect U.S. consumers.\nAdditionally, the DSCSA directs FDA to establish national licensure standards for wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers, and requires\nthese entities report licensure and other information to FDA annually. The implementation and enforcement of complete unit level traceability of verifiable\nreturn serialization, including aggregation throughout the whole supply chain, is not required as of November 27, 2023. Although the rule regarding\nwholesale distributor verification of saleable returned products does not directly apply to our Company, we are required to assist our wholesale distributor\ncustomers by setting in place mechanics that would allow for traceability of returns in the supply chain. If we are not able to come into compliance of this\nrule, our wholesale distributor customers may not accept our returns on our behalf.\nWe are subject to, and required to be in compliance with, the DQSA. Our Company remains in compliance with the requirements promogulated by the\nDSCSA and intends on remaining vigilant with regards to any potential modifications to the act. For purposes of our business, we are considered both\nmanufacturers and re-packagers under the act. Currently, we are in compliance with the DSCSA as it relates to our business and operations.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following information sets forth risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements\nwe have made in this report and those we may make from time to time. You should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other\ninformation contained in this report and our other public filings, before making an investment decision. Our business, financial condition or results of\noperations could be harmed by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently\nknown to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time also may impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry and Existing Operating Revenue Stream\nFuture revenue from sales of our dermatology products may be lower than expected or lower than in previous periods.\nThe vast majority of our operating income for the foreseeable future is expected to come from the sale of our dermatology products. Any setback that may\noccur with respect to such products could significantly impair our operating results and/or reduce our revenue and the value of our securities. Setbacks for\nsuch products could include, but are not limited to, issues related to: supply chain, shipping; distribution; demand; manufacturing; product safety; product\nquality; marketing; government regulation; pricing; reimbursement; licensing and approval; intellectual property rights; competition with existing or new\nproducts; product acceptance by physicians, other licensed medical professionals and patients; and higher than expected total rebates, returns or recalls.\nAlso, the majority of our sales derive from products that are without patent protection and/or are or may become subject to third-party generic competition,\nthe introduction of new competitor products, or increased market share of existing competitor products, any of which could have a significant adverse effect\non our operating income.\nWe face challenges as our products face generic competition and/or losses of exclusivity.\nOur products do and may compete with well-established products, both branded and generic, with similar or the same indications. We face increased\ncompetition from manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products, who may submit applications to the FDA seeking to market generic versions of our\nproducts. In connection with these applications, the generic drug companies may seek to challenge the validity and enforceability of our patents through\nlitigation. When patents covering certain of our products expire or are successfully challenged through litigation or in USPTO proceedings, if a generic\ncompany launches a competing product “at risk,” or when the regulatory or licensed exclusivity for our products expires or is otherwise lost, we may face\ngeneric competition as a result.\n26\nTable of Contents\nThe majority of our sales derive from products that are without patent protection and/or are or may become subject to third-party generic competition, the\nintroduction of new competitor products, or an increase in market share of existing competitor products, any of which could have a significant adverse\nimpact on our operating income. Three of our marketed products, Qbrexza, Amzeeq, and Zilxi as well as DFD-29, currently have patent protection. Three\nof our marketed products, Accutane, Targadox, and Exelderm, do not have patent protection or otherwise are not eligible for patent protection. Accutane\ncurrently competes in the Isotretinoin market with five other therapeutic equivalent (“AB rated”) products. Targadox faces AB rated generic competition.\nExelderm may face AB rated generic competition in the future.\nGeneric versions are generally significantly less expensive than branded versions, and, where available, may be required to be utilized before or in\npreference to the branded version under third-party reimbursement programs, or substituted by pharmacies. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its\nmarket exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. To successfully compete for business with managed care\nand pharmacy benefits management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits, but also cost advantages as\ncompared with other forms of care. If we fail to do so, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nAny disruptions to the capabilities, composition, size or existence of our field sales force may have a significant adverse impact on our existing revenue\nstream. Further, our ability to effectively market and sell any future products that we may develop will depend on our ability to establish and maintain\nsales and marketing capabilities or to enter into agreements with third parties to market, distribute and sell any such products.\nOur field sales force has been and is expected to continue to be an important contributor to our commercial success. Any disruptions to our relationship\nwith our field sales force could materially adversely affect our product sales. We may rely on professional employer organizations and staffing\norganizations for the employment of our field sales force in the future.\nThe establishment, development, and/or expansion of a field sales force, either by us or certain of our partners or vendors, or the establishment of a field\nsales force to market any products for which we may have or receive marketing approval, is expensive and time-consuming and could delay any such\nproduct launch or compromise the successful commercialization of such products. If we are unable to establish and maintain sales and marketing\ncapabilities or any other non-technical capabilities necessary to commercialize any products that may be successfully developed, we will need to contract\nwith third parties to market and sell such products. We may not be able to establish or maintain arrangements with third parties on commercially reasonable\nterms, or at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nOur current and potential future product candidates may not receive regulatory approval, or such approval may be delayed, which would have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Further, even if a product receives regulatory approval, such product will remain\nsubject to substantial regulatory scrutiny.\nOur current and potential future product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design,\ntesting, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive\nregulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and abroad. Our failure to obtain marketing approval for any current or future\nproduct candidates will prevent us from commercializing the product candidates. Further, any products or future products candidates we license or acquire\nwill be subject to ongoing requirements and review by such regulatory authorities.\nWe have limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and expect to rely on third parties to assist us in\nthis process. To secure marketing approval, we will be required to establish a product candidate’s safety and efficacy by submitting extensive preclinical\nand clinical data and supporting information for each therapeutic indication. We will further be required to submit information about the product\nmanufacturing and to undergo regulatory inspection of our third-party manufacturing facilities to ensure ongoing compliance with cGMP requirements.\nAny of our current or future product candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended\nside effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude us from obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. If our current or\nfuture product candidates receive(s) marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit the approved use of our drug in this way, which could limit\nsales of the product.\n27\nTable of Contents\nThe marketing approval process, both in the United States and abroad, is time consuming and expensive. Approval may take many years, and if it is granted\ncan vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Our product\ncandidates could be delayed in receiving, or fail to receive, regulatory approval for many reasons, including: the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory\nauthorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials; the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with\nour development strategy; we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a drug\ncandidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication or is suitable to identify appropriate patient populations; the results of clinical trials may not meet\nthe level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval; we may be unable to demonstrate that a\nproduct candidate’s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks.\nChanges to marketing approval policies or the regulatory landscape during the development period may cause rejection of or delays in the approval of an\napplication. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or decide that our data is\ninsufficient for approval and require costly additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from\npreclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may\nbe limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable. If we experience delays in\nobtaining or fail to obtain or maintain any necessary approvals of any current or future product candidates, receive approval for fewer or more limited\nindications than we request or without including the labeling claims we desire, our future commercial prospects may be harmed and our ability to generate\nrevenue may be materially impaired. Even if we do receive approval, it may be contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials to\nverify whether or not the drug provides the anticipated clinical benefit, in order to maintain the approval.\nRegulatory approval for any approved product is limited by the FDA to those specific indications and conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy\nhave been demonstrated.\nAny regulatory approval is limited to those specific diseases and indications for which a product is deemed to be safe and effective. If the FDA or any\nregulatory authority limits the scope of our indication, or if we are unable to obtain FDA approval for any desired future indications for our products, our\nability to effectively market and sell our products may be reduced and our business may be adversely affected. Further, we are only permitted to promote\nour products for those indications specifically approved by the FDA and there are restrictions around making communications regarding uses not approved\nand described in the product’s labeling. If our promotional activities fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to advisory or\nenforcement action by these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow FDA requirements or guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause\nthe FDA to suspend or withdraw an approved product from the market, require a recall or institute fines, or could result in disgorgement of money,\noperating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any of which could harm our business.\nIf the FDA does not conclude that a product candidate satisfies the requirements for the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, or if the\nrequirements for such product candidate under Section 505(b)(2) are not as we expect, the approval pathway for the product candidate will likely take\nsignificantly longer, cost significantly more and entail significantly greater complications and risks than anticipated, and in either case may not be\nsuccessful.\nThe Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, added Section 505(b)(2) to the FDCA.\nSection 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies that were not conducted by\nor for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Section 505(b)(2), if applicable to us under the FDCA, would allow an\nNDA we submit to FDA to rely in part on data in the public domain or the FDA’s prior conclusions regarding the safety and effectiveness of approved\ncompounds, which could expedite the development program for our product candidates by potentially decreasing the amount of clinical data that we would\nneed to generate in order to obtain FDA approval. If the FDA does not allow us to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway as anticipated, we may\nneed to conduct additional clinical trials, provide additional data and information, and meet additional standards for regulatory approval. If this were to\noccur, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for these product candidates, and complications and risks associated with these\nproduct candidates, would likely substantially increase. We could need to obtain more additional funding, which could result in significant dilution to the\nownership interests of our then existing stockholders to the extent we issue equity securities or convertible debt. We cannot assure you that we would be\nable to obtain such additional financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Moreover, inability to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway would\nlikely result in new competitive products reaching the market more quickly than our product candidates, which would likely materially adversely impact\nour competitive position and prospects. Even if we are allowed to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, we cannot assure you that our product\ncandidates will receive the requisite approvals for commercialization.\n28\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, notwithstanding the approval of a number of products by the FDA under Section 505(b)(2) over the last few years, certain brand-name\npharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is\nsuccessfully challenged, the FDA may change its Section 505(b)(2) policies and practices, which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any\nNDA that we submit under Section 505(b)(2). In addition, the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are subject to\nspecial requirements designed to protect the patent rights of sponsors of previously approved drugs that are referenced in a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. These\nrequirements may give rise to patent litigation and mandatory delays in approval of our NDAs for up to 30 months or longer depending on the outcome of\nany litigation. It is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose\nadditional approval requirements for, pending competing products. If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the\nnew product. However, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the\npetition. In addition, even if we are able to utilize the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, there is no guarantee this would ultimately lead to faster\nproduct development or earlier approval.\nMoreover, even if our product candidates are approved under Section 505(b)(2), the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which\nthe products may be marketed or to other conditions of approval, or may contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor\nthe safety or efficacy of the products.\nIf any of our contract manufacturers fails to produce our products in the volumes that we require on a timely basis, or to comply with stringent\nregulations applicable to pharmaceutical drug manufacturers, we may face delays in the commercialization of this product candidate or be unable to\nmeet market demand, and may lose potential revenues.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing\ntechniques and process controls, and the use of specialized processing equipment. Any termination or disruption of any current or future relationships\nrelating to product development may materially harm our business and financial condition and frustrate any commercialization efforts for affected current\nor future product candidates.\nAny current or future contract manufacturers we engage must comply with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations, including cGMP\nrequirements enforced by the FDA through its establishment inspection program. Despite the existence of contract manufacturing agreements and shared\ncGMP responsibilities, our contract manufacturers’ may ignore these contractual provisions, or otherwise fail to meet the minimum standards set forth in\nthe cGMP regulations, resulting in manufacturing non-compliance. This may go unnoticed or uncorrected despite our best efforts to regulatory audit or\nconfirm the CMOs regulatory responsibilities. Any failure to comply with applicable regulations may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of\nproduction, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval, and would limit the availability of our\nproduct. Any manufacturing defect or error discovered after products have been produced and distributed could result in even more significant\nconsequences, including costly recalls, re-stocking costs, damage to our reputation and potential for product liability claims.\nIf the CMOs upon which we rely to manufacture any current products, and any potential product candidates we may in-license or acquire, fail to deliver the\nrequired commercial quantities on a timely basis at commercially reasonable prices, we would likely be unable to meet demand for our products and we\nwould lose potential revenues.\nIf serious adverse or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of any current or future product candidates, we may need to\nabandon or limit our development of some of the other potential product candidates.\nIf any current or future product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects, toxicities, or other negative characteristics, we may need to abandon\nsuch products’ commercialization, development or limit development to more narrow uses or subpopulations. Such side effects may affect patient\nrecruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial and could result in potential product liability claims. Many compounds that show initial\npromise in early-stage testing are later found to cause side effects that prevent further development. If our clinical trials reveal severe or prevalent side\neffects, our trials could be suspended or terminated, we may be unable to recruit patients and enrolled patients may be unable to complete the trials, and the\nFDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order issue a clinical hold, or order us to cease further development or deny approval of the\nproduct candidate. The FDA may also request additional data, which it has done with increased prevalence in recent years, which has resulted in substantial\ndelays in new drug approvals. Undesirable side effects caused by any current or future product candidates could also result in the inclusion of unfavorable\ninformation in our product labeling, denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications, and in turn\nprevent us from commercializing and generating revenues from the sale of such product candidate.\n29\nTable of Contents\nIf one or more of our current products or any future product candidate receives marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable adverse\nevents or side effects caused by this product, or we fail to comply with post-market regulatory requirements, a number of potentially significant negative\nconsequences could result, including:\n● regulatory authorities may require the addition of unfavorable labeling statements, specific warnings or a contraindication;\n● regulatory authorities may suspend or withdraw their approval of the product, or require it to be removed from the market;\n● we may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product; or\n● our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of any current or future product candidate or could substantially\nincrease our development and commercialization costs and expenses, which could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues.\nAll of our current and future products will remain subject to substantial regulatory scrutiny even after receiving regulatory approval.\nAny products or current or future product candidates we may license or acquire will be subject to ongoing regulatory and compliance requirements and\noversight by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and\nsubmission of safety and other post-market information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to manufacturing,\nquality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to\nphysicians and other licensed medical professionals and recordkeeping of the drug. The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 granted\nsignificant expanded authority to the FDA, much of which was aimed at improving the safety of drug products before and after approval. The FDA may also\nimpose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. The FDA closely\nregulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the\nprovisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use and if we do not\nmarket our products for only their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. While physicians and other\nhealthcare providers may choose to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in\nclinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities, our ability to promote the products is limited to those indications that are specifically approved\nby the FDA. These “off-label” uses are common across medical specialties and may constitute an appropriate treatment for some patients in varied\ncircumstances. Regulatory authorities in the U.S. generally do not regulate the practice of medicine, including the clinical behavior of physicians and other\nhealthcare providers in their choice of treatments. Regulatory authorities do; however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies on the subject\nof off-label use.\nViolations of the FDCA relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud\nand abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or\nfailure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:\n● restrictions on such products or their manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n● restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n● restrictions on product distribution or use;\n● requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n● warning letters, untitled letters, or Form 483s;\n30\nTable of Contents\n● withdrawal of the products from the market;\n● refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n● recall of products;\n● fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits;\n● suspension or withdrawal of marketing or regulatory approvals;\n● suspension of any ongoing clinical trials;\n● denial of permits to import or export our products;\n● product seizure; or\n● injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA’s policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our\ncurrent or future product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies,\nor if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained.\nOur current and future relationships with customers and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere may be subject, directly or indirectly, to\napplicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, transparency, health information privacy and security and other healthcare laws and\nregulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and\ndiminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of\nour current products or current or future product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with third-party\npayors for the sales of our products and sales to customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations,\nincluding, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”) and the federal False Claims Act, which may constrain the business or financial\narrangements and relationships through which we sell, market and distribute any current products or current or future product candidates for which we\nobtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by U.S. federal and state governments and by\ngovernments in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that may\naffect our ability to operate include:\n● AKS, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly\nor indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or\nrecommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and\nMedicaid. The OIG continues to make modifications to existing AKS safe harbors which may increase liability and risk as well as adversely impact\nsales relationships. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to these federal laws, which apply to items and services\nreimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor;\n● federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil\npenalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the\nfederal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to\navoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n● the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a\nscheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n31\nTable of Contents\n● HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and their respective implementing\nregulations, which impose obligations on covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business\nassociates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to\nsafeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n● the federal Open Payments program, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available\nunder Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare &\nMedicaid Services (“CMS”), information related to “payments or other transfers of value” made to physicians, which is defined to include doctors,\ndentists, optometrists, podiatrists, chiropractors, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists,\ncertified nurse-midwives and teaching hospitals and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to\nCMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members;\n● Increased OIG scrutiny on the sale of our products through specialty pharmacies by means of direct investigation or by issuance of unfavorable\nOpinion Letters which may curtail or hinder the sales of our products based on risk of enforcement upon our-selves or our buyers;\n● analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing\narrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state\nand foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the\nrelevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers;\n● state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other\nhealthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and\n● state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circum-stances, many of which differ from each other in\nsignificant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial\ncosts. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or\ncase law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or\nany other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without\nlimitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the\ncurtailment or restructuring of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If any of the physicians or other healthcare\nproviders or entities with whom we expect to do business, including our collaborators, is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, it may be\nsubject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from participation in government healthcare programs, which could also\nmaterially affect our business.\nWe have established and implemented a corporate compliance program designed to prevent, detect and correct violations of state and federal healthcare\nlaws, including laws related to advertising and promotion of our products. Nonetheless, enforcement agencies or private plaintiffs may take the position that\nwe are not in compliance with such requirements and, if such noncompliance is proven, the Company and, in some cases, individual employees, may be\nsubject to significant liability, including the aforementioned administrative, civil and criminal sanctions.\n32\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to new legislation, regulatory proposals and managed care initiatives that may increase our costs of compliance and adversely affect our\nability to market our products, obtain collaborators and raise capital.\nIn the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory\nchanges to the healthcare system that could impact our ability to sell our licensed products profitably. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable\nCare Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “PPACA” or collectively, the “ACA”), was signed into law, which\nsubstantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. By way of example, the ACA:\nincreased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for\ndrugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain\n“branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs; implemented a new methodology under which rebates owed by manufacturers\nunder the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded the eligibility criteria\nfor Medicaid programs; created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical\neffectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (“CMMI”) at the CMS, to test\ninnovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.\nSince its enactment, there have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional\nchallenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. On January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order stating that his administration\nintended to seek prompt repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and, pending repeal, directed the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other\nexecutive departments and agencies to take all steps necessary to limit any fiscal or regulatory burdens of the Affordable Care Act. On January 28, 2021,\nPresident Biden signed an Executive Order on Strengthening Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act and stated his administration’s intentions to reverse the\nactions of his predecessor and strengthen the ACA. As part of this Executive Order, the Department of Health and Human Services, United States Treasury,\nand the Department of Labor are directed to review all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, and agency actions to consider if they are\nconsistent with ensuring both coverage under the ACA and making high-quality healthcare affordable and accessible to Americans. On March 11, 2021,\nPresident Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to further strengthen Medicaid and the ACA and on April 5, 2022, President Biden\nsigned the Executive Order on Continuing to Strengthen Americans’ Access to Affordable, Quality Health Coverage in which he celebrated the significant\nprogress his administration believes has been made across the U.S. in making healthcare more affordable and accessible. In this Executive Order, President\nBiden directed agencies “with responsibilities related to Americans’ access to health coverage” to “review agency actions to identify ways to continue to\nexpand the availability of affordable health coverage.” The continued expansion of the government’s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may further lower\nrates of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products. While we are unable to predict the likelihood of changes to the ACA or other healthcare laws which\nmay negatively impact our profitability, we continue to closely monitor all changes.\nPresident Biden intends, as his predecessor did, to take action against drug prices which are considered “high.” Drug pricing continues to be a subject of\ndebate at the executive and legislative levels of U.S. government. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 signed into law by President Biden on March 14,\n2021 includes a provision that will eliminate the statutory cap on rebates drug manufacturers pay to Medicaid beginning in January 2024. With the\nelimination of the rebate cap, manufacturers may be required to compensate states in an amount greater than what the state Medicaid programs pay for the\ndrug. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 contains substantial drug pricing reforms, including the establishment of a drug price negotiation\nprogram within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that would require manufacturers to charge a negotiated “maximum fair price” for\ncertain selected drugs or pay an excise tax for noncompliance, the establishment of rebate payment requirements on manufacturers of certain drugs payable\nunder Medicare Parts B and D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation, and requires manufacturers to provide discounts on Part D drugs.\nSubstantial penalties can be assessed for noncompliance with the drug pricing provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The Inflation Reduction\nAct of 2022 could have the effect of reducing the prices we can charge and reimbursement we receive for our products, if approved, thereby reducing our\nprofitability, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. The effect of Inflation\nReduction Act of 2022 on our business and the pharmaceutical industry in general is not yet known.\n33\nTable of Contents\nAt the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing,\nincluding price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency\nmeasures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. We expect that additional federal, state and\nforeign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for\nhealthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, once approved, or\nadditional pricing pressures.\nThese and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward\npressure on the price that we receive for any current product or future product candidate. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other\ngovernment healthcare programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or\nother healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products. Legislative and regulatory\nproposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for drugs. We cannot be sure whether\nadditional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such\nchanges on the marketing approvals of any current or future product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased Congressional scrutiny of the FDA’s\napproval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing\nand other requirements.\nPublic concern regarding the safety of any of our current or future drug products could delay or limit our ability to obtain regulatory approval, result in\nthe inclusion of unfavorable information in our labeling, or require us to incur additional costs.\nIn light of widely publicized events concerning the safety risk of certain drug products, the FDA, members of Congress, the Government Accountability\nOffice, medical professionals and the general public have raised concerns about potential drug safety issues. These events have resulted in the withdrawal of\ndrug products, revisions to drug labeling that further limit use of the drug products, and the establishment of risk management programs. The increased\nattention to drug safety issues may result in a more cautious approach by the FDA in its review of data from our clinical trials. Data from clinical trials may\nreceive greater scrutiny, particularly with respect to safety, which may make the FDA or other regulatory authorities more likely to require additional\npreclinical studies or clinical trials. If the FDA requires us to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials prior to approving any other potential\nfuture product candidate, our ability to obtain of such product candidate will be delayed. If the FDA requires us to provide additional clinical or preclinical\ndata following the approval of any potential future product candidate, the indications for which such product candidate is approved may be limited or there\nmay be specific warnings or limitations on dosing, and our efforts to commercialize potential future product candidate may be otherwise adversely\nimpacted.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in any future clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be\ndelayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate any future clinical trials for any current or future product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number\nof eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Some of our competitors\nmay have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that treat the same indications as our current or potential future product candidates, and patients who\nwould otherwise be eligible for any future clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors’ product candidates. Patient enrollment is\naffected by other factors, including:\n● the severity of the disease under investigation;\n● the eligibility criteria for a study;\n● the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n● the efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n● the patient referral practices of physicians;\n● the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n34\nTable of Contents\n● the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for any future clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to abandon any\nfuture clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in any future clinical trials may result in increased development costs for any current or future product\ncandidates, which would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\nWe expect intense competition for our products and current or future product candidates, and new products may emerge that provide different or better\ntherapeutic alternatives for our targeted indications.\nWe face, and will continue to face, competition in the development and marketing of products from academic institutions, government agencies, research\ninstitutions and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including specialty and other large pharmaceutical companies, and OTC companies and\ngeneric manufacturers. The dermatology competitive landscape is highly fragmented, with many mid-size and smaller companies competing in the\nprescription sector. Our competitors are pursuing the development and/or acquisition of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and OTC products targeting the\nsame diseases, conditions, and indications as our products. There can be no assurance that our competitors’ developments, including the development of\nother drug technologies and methods of preventing the incidence of disease, will not render our current products or current or future product candidates\nobsolete or noncompetitive.\nIf patents covering any of our currently marketed products expire or are successfully challenged, or when the regulatory or licensed exclusivity for our\nproducts expires or is otherwise lost, we will face increased competition from generic versions of our products. Generic versions are generally significantly\nless expensive than branded versions and third-party reimbursement programs may require or prefer that a generic version is used before the branded\nversion. Accordingly, when a branded product loses market exclusivity, the product faces intense price competition from generic versions. To successfully\ncompete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations, we must demonstrate that our products offer medical and cost\nadvantages when compared with other forms.\nCompetitive factors vary by product line and geographic area in which the products are sold. The principal methods of competition for our products include\nquality, efficacy, market acceptance, price, and marketing and promotional efforts. The commercial opportunity for our products and/or product future\ncandidates could be significantly harmed if competitors are able to develop alternative formulations outside the scope of our in-licensed intellectual\nproperty. Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater capital resources, development resources, including personnel and technology,\nclinical trial and regulatory experience, expertise in the prosecution of intellectual property rights, and manufacturing, distribution, and sales and marketing\nthan we do.\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we are able to or may obtain patent\nprotection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize any current or future product candidates. Our competitors\nmay also develop drugs or products that are more effective, safe, useful and less costly than ours and may be more successful than us in manufacturing and\nmarketing their drugs or products. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition\nor cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nIf our products do not achieve broad market acceptance, including by government and third-party payors, the revenues that we generate from sales will\nbe limited.\nThe commercial success of our products or any current or future product candidates will depend upon their acceptance by the medical community and\ncoverage and reimbursement for our products by third-party payors, including government payors. The degree of market acceptance of our products or any\nother potential product candidate we may develop, license or acquire will depend on a number of factors, including:\n● the success of any potential clinical studies during the drug development process;\n● limitations of use, contraindications, or warnings contained in the product’s FDA-approved labeling;\n● changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for any current or future product candidates, which could reduce the marketing impact of\nany superiority claims that we could make following FDA approval;\n35\nTable of Contents\n● ability to be listed on formularies (lists of recommended or approved medicines and other products) and reimbursement lists by demonstrating the\nqualities and treatment benefits of our products within their approved indications; and\n● potential advantages over, and availability of, alternative treatments.\nOur ability to effectively promote and sell our products and any other current or future product candidates we may develop, license or acquire in the\nmarketplace will also depend on pricing and cost effectiveness, including our ability to produce a product at a competitive price and achieve acceptance of\nthe product onto formularies, as well as our ability to obtain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement. Since many insurance plans are members of\ngroup purchasing organizations, which leverage the purchasing power of a group of entities to obtain discounts based on the collective buying power of the\ngroup, our ability to attract customers in the marketplace will also depend on our ability to effectively promote any current or future product candidates to\ngroup purchasing organizations. We will also need to demonstrate acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy, as well as relative convenience and ease of\nadministration. Market acceptance could be further limited depending on the prevalence and severity of any expected or unexpected adverse side effects\nassociated with any current or future product candidates. If any current or future product candidates are approved but do not achieve an adequate level of\nacceptance by physicians, health care payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products, and we may not become or remain\nprofitable. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of any current or future product candidates may\nrequire significant resources and may never be successful.\nFurther, in both domestic and foreign markets, any future product sales will depend in part upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-\nparty payors. Such third-party payors include government health programs such as Medicare, managed care providers, private health insurers and other\norganizations. We may need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any future products to the satisfaction of\ntarget customers and their third-party payors. Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other\nresources. Our current or future products might not ultimately be considered cost-effective. Adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement might not be\navailable to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nIf we are unable to maintain sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities, or to enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell current or\nfuture product candidates, we may not be successful in generating revenues from selling and commercializing any such product candidates.\nIn order to commercialize any current or future product candidates that have not yet received marketing approval or for which we have not yet acquired\nrights, we may need to build additional marketing, sales, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third\nparties to perform these services tailored to those products, and we may not be successful in doing so. In the event of successful development and\nregulatory approval of any potential new product candidate, or a new product acquisition, we expect to build a targeted specialist field sales force to market\nor co-promote that specific product. There are risks involved with establishing our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. For example,\nrecruiting and training a field sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a future product\ncandidate or acquired product for which we recruit a field sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we\nwould have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot\nretain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to maintain our current products’ marketing and sales organizations and/or commercialize any future products on our\nown include:\n● our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n● the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians and other healthcare providers or persuade adequate numbers of physicians and other\nhealthcare providers to prescribe any future products;\n● the lack of complementary or other products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage from the perspective\nof sales efficiency relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n● unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\n36\nTable of Contents\nWe are dependent on third parties to supply raw materials used in our products, to manufacture our products, and to provide services for certain core\naspects of our business. Any interruption or failure by these suppliers, distributors, and collaboration partners to meet their contractual obligations to\nus or obligations pursuant to applicable laws and regulations may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations\nand cash flows.\nWe rely on third parties to supply raw materials, to manufacture, warehouse, and distribute our products, as well as to provide customer service support,\nmedical affairs services, clinical studies, sales, and other technical and financial services. All third-party suppliers and contractors are subject to FDA\nrequirements, as well as those of comparable regulatory authorities. Our business and financial viability are dependent on the continued supply of goods\nand services by these third parties, the regulatory compliance of these third parties and on the strength, validity and terms of our various contracts with\nthese third parties. Any interruption or failure by our suppliers, distributors and collaboration partners to meet their obligations pursuant to various\nagreements with us on schedule or in accordance with our expectations, misappropriation of our proprietary information, including trade secrets and know-\nhow, or any termination by these third parties of their arrangements with us, which, in each case, could be the result of one or many factors outside of our\ncontrol, could delay or prevent the future development, future approval, manufacture or commercialization of our products, result in non-compliance with\napplicable laws and regulations, cause us to incur failure-to-supply penalties with our wholesale customers, disrupt our operations or cause reputational\nharm to our company, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We\nmay also be unsuccessful in resolving any underlying issues with such suppliers, distributors and partners or replacing them within a reasonable time and on\ncommercially reasonable terms.\nWe do not expect to have the resources or capacity to commercially manufacture any future approved product candidates ourselves. We will likely continue\nto be heavily dependent upon third-party manufacturers, over whose manufacturing practices and processes we will have oversight, but not direct control,\nwhich may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products in a timely or cost-effective manner, if at all. If any of our third-party\nmanufacturers should become unavailable to us for any reason, including as a result of capacity constraints, differing priorities, financial difficulties or\ninsolvency, we would likely incur added costs and delays in identifying or qualifying replacements. We may be unable to establish agreements with such\nreplacement manufacturers or to do so on terms acceptable to us, and our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be\nnegatively impacted.\nThe pharmaceutical manufacturing process requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing\ntechniques and process controls, and the use of specialized processing equipment. Further, the CMOs with which we contract must comply with strictly\nenforced federal, state, and foreign regulations, including the cGMP requirements enforced by the FDA. We will rely on our CMOs to comply with all such\nregulatory requirements, including cGMP requirements, and failure to do so may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension,\ndelay, or withdrawal of product approval, product seizure or recall, and may limit the availability of our product. Any manufacturing defect or error\ndiscovered after products have been produced and distributed could result in costly recall procedures, re-stocking costs, damage to our reputation and\npotential for product liability claims. The FDA would likely hold us ultimately responsible for any product our CMO manufactures and regulatory\nenforcement for failure to meet FDA requirements would impact both the CMO and ourselves. The FDA considers the owners of drug products to be\nultimately responsible for their products, even where a CMO or other third-party manufacturer fails to meet FDA requirements specific to manufacturing\nactivities. Despite the fact that we have limited oversight, and no direct control over these manufacturing activities, any failure by a CMO to meet the\nrequirements of the regulations would have an adverse impact on both the CMO and ourselves.\nWe also may rely on third-party manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our current or future product\ncandidates for anticipated clinical trials. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials that are used to manufacture\nthose products. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our third-party manufacturers. Moreover,\nwe currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials. Any significant delay in the supply of raw material\ncomponents related to an ongoing clinical trial could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval.\nWe rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to conduct any future preclinical studies and clinical trials, and those third parties may not\nperform satisfactorily, including by failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials or to comply with applicable regulatory requirements.\nWe expect to rely on third-party contract and clinical research organizations, clinical data management organizations, and medical institutions and clinical\ninvestigators to conduct future preclinical studies and clinical trials. Any future agreements with these third parties might terminate for a variety of reasons,\nincluding a failure to perform by the third parties. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, that could delay any future product development\nactivities.\n37\nTable of Contents\nOur reliance on any third parties for research and development activities will reduce our own control over these activities but will not relieve us of our\nresponsibilities. We will remain responsible for ensuring that each of any future preclinical studies and clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the\ngeneral investigational plan and protocols for the trial and for ensuring that any future preclinical studies are conducted in accordance with good laboratory\npractice (“GLP”) as appropriate. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices (“GCPs”) for\nconducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity\nand confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Regulatory authorities enforce these requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors,\nclinical investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our future clinical research organizations fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data\ngenerated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional\nclinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that any such regulatory authority, upon inspection of any future clinical\ntrial, will determine that such clinical trial complies with cGMP regulations. In addition, any future clinical trials must be conducted with product produced\nunder cGMP regulations and subject to an IND. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the\nregulatory approval process. We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-\nsponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.\nThe third parties with whom we may contract to help perform future preclinical studies or clinical trials may also have relationships with other entities,\nsome of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our\npreclinical studies or clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in\nobtaining, marketing approvals for any current or future product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully\ncommercialize such product candidates.\nIf any of our future relationships with these third-party contract research organizations or clinical research organizations terminate, we may not be able to\nenter into arrangements with alternative contract research organizations or clinical research organizations or to do so on commercially reasonable terms.\nSwitching or adding additional contract research organizations or clinical research organizations involves additional cost and requires management time and\nfocus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new contract research organization or clinical research organization commences work. As a\nresult, delays could occur, which could compromise our ability to meet our desired development timelines. Though we will carefully manage any future\nrelationships with contract research organizations or clinical research organizations, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges\nor delays in the future.\nWe rely on clinical data and results obtained by third parties that could ultimately prove to be inaccurate or unreliable.\nAs part of our strategy to mitigate development risk, we intend on developing product candidates with validated mechanisms of action and assess potential\nclinical efficacy early in the development process or otherwise acquire the rights to products for which marketing approval has already been obtained. This\nstrategy necessarily relies upon clinical data and other results obtained by third parties that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate or unreliable. If the third-\nparty data and results we rely upon prove to be inaccurate, unreliable or not applicable to future product candidates or acquired products, we could make\ninaccurate assumptions and conclusions about current or future product candidates and our research and development efforts could be compromised.\nIf successful product liability claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability, and may have to limit the commercialization of certain\ncurrent or future products or product candidates.\nThe use of our products and any current or future product candidate we may license, acquire or develop in clinical trials and the sale of any products for\nwhich we obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims. For example, we may be sued if any product or product candidate we\ndevelop or sell allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing, or sale. Product liability\nclaims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers or others who use, administer, or sell our products. If we cannot successfully\ndefend ourselves against these claims, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n● termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs or withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n● regulatory investigations by governmental authorities related to regulatory issues or alleged non-compliances;\n● litigation costs and potential monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n38\nTable of Contents\n● harm to our reputation and/or decreased demand for our products and corresponding revenue loss;\n● reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n● the inability to commercialize our current products or any current or future product candidates.\nWe have obtained or will obtain limited product liability insurance coverage for any and all current or future clinical trials. However, our insurance\ncoverage may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is\nbecoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to\nprotect us against losses due to liability. Our current insurance coverage includes the sale of commercial products, but we may be unable to maintain or\nobtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in\nclass action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could\ncause our stock price to fall and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and materially adversely affect our business, results\nof operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe began marketing and promoting Accutane®, an isotretinoin product in the second quarter of 2021. Isotretinoin has a black box warning for use in\npregnant women. Isotretinoin also has warnings for side effects related to psychiatric disorders and inflammatory bowel disease, among others. Historically,\nisotretinoin has been the subject of significant product liability claims, mainly related to irritable bowel disease. Currently, there is no significant\nisotretinoin product liability litigation. In 2014, the federal multi-district litigation (“MDL”) court ruled that the warning label for isotretinoin was adequate\nand dismissed all remaining federal isotretinoin cases. The MDL dissolved in 2015, effectively ending federal isotretinoin lawsuits. Isotretinoin cases\ncontinued in New Jersey state court until 2017, when the trial court judge dismissed the remaining isotretinoin product liability cases. Accordingly, we have\nsubstantial defenses should a product liability claim arise related to isotretinoin. However, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any litigation and the\nCompany may be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlement or judgments should any new product liability claim be brought.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use,\nstorage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including\nchemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these\nmaterials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. Although we believe that the safety procedures for\nhandling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental\ncontamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable\nfor any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. If we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we\ncould become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\nAlthough we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from\nthe use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for\nenvironmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive\nmaterials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or\nfuture laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may\nresult in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\n39\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to our Growth\nA significant part of our future growth may depend on our ability to identify and acquire or in-license products, and if we do not successfully identify\nand acquire or in-license related product candidates or integrate them into our operations, we may have limited growth opportunities.\nAn important part of our business strategy is to continue to develop a pipeline of product candidates by acquiring or in-licensing products, product\ncandidates, businesses or technologies that we believe are a strategic fit with our focus on the dermatological marketplace. Future in-licenses or acquisitions\nmay entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n● exposure to unknown liabilities;\n● disruption of our business and diversion of our management’s time and attention to develop acquired products or technologies;\n● difficulty or inability to secure financing to fund development activities for such acquired or in-licensed technologies in the current economic\nenvironment;\n● incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of securities to pay for acquisitions;\n● higher than expected acquisition and integration costs;\n● increased amortization expenses;\n● difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n● impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and\n● inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses.\nWe have limited resources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third-party products, current or future product candidates, businesses,\nand technologies and to integrate them into our current infrastructure. As a result, we focus on research programs and product candidates that we identify\nfor specific indications, which may cause us to forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that may have\ngreater commercial potential. Further, we may devote resources to potential acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that are ultimately not completed or\nof which we do not realize the anticipated benefits. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or\nprofitable market opportunities. Our spending on future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield\nany commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may\nrelinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been\nmore advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nAdditionally, we may compete with larger pharmaceutical companies and other competitors for new collaborations and in-licensing opportunities. These\ncompetitors likely will have greater financial resources than we do and may have greater expertise in identifying and evaluating new opportunities. The\nrealization of any of the foregoing risks related to our acquisition and in-license strategy could materially adversely affect our business, results of\noperations, financial condition or cash flows.\n40\nTable of Contents\nOur growth is subject to economic and political conditions.\nOur business is affected by global and local economic and political conditions as well as the state of the financial markets, inflation, recession, financial\nliquidity, currency volatility, growth, and policy initiatives. There can be no assurance that global economic conditions and financial markets will not\nworsen and that we will not experience any adverse effects that may be material to our consolidated cash flows, results of operations, financial position or\nour ability to access capital, such as the adverse effects resulting from a prolonged shutdown in government operations both in the United States and\ninternationally. Political changes, including war or other conflicts, some of which may be disruptive, could interfere with our supply chain, our customers\nand all of our activities in a particular location.\nOur operating history may make it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects as it relates to clinical trials or regulatory approvals.\nWe were incorporated in October 2014 and have only been conducting commercial operations with respect to our products since 2015. We have not yet\ndemonstrated an ability to successfully complete clinical trials or obtain regulatory approvals. Consequently, any predictions about our future performance\nmay not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing future pharmaceutical products.\nIn addition, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other known and unknown factors. We will need to expand our\ncapabilities to support any future commercial activities. We may not be successful in adding such capabilities.\nWe expect our financial condition and operating results to continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors, many of\nwhich are beyond our control. Accordingly, you should not rely upon the results of any past quarterly period as an indication of future operating\nperformance.\nWe may not be able to manage our business effectively if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel.\nWe may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and commercial, sales, scientific and clinical personnel in the future due to the intense\ncompetition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. If we are not able to attract and retain necessary personnel\nto accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede sales growth of our branded and generic products, the\nachievement of our development objectives, our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategy.\nWe may decide to sell assets, which could adversely affect our prospects and opportunities for growth.\nWe may from time to time consider selling certain assets if we determine that such assets are not critical to our strategy or we believe the opportunity to\nmonetize the asset is attractive or for various other reasons, including for the reduction of indebtedness. Although our expectation is to engage in asset sales\nonly if they advance or otherwise support our overall strategy, we may be forced to sell assets in response to liquidation or other claims described herein,\nand any such sale could reduce the size or scope of our business, our market share in particular markets or our opportunities with respect to certain markets,\nproducts or therapeutic categories. As a result, any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations\nand cash flows.\nThere is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. We may need to raise additional funding (which may not be available\non acceptable terms to the Company, or at all) and/or to delay, limit or terminate certain of our product development and commercialization efforts or\nother operations.\nOur current assumptions, projected commercial sales of our products, clinical development plans and regulatory submission timelines are uncertain and\nmay not emerge as expected. Additionally, as a result of recurring losses from operations, we have concluded that there is substantial doubt regarding our\nability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of the financial statements included in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to reductions in sales force and marketing expenses, we may also seek to raise\ncapital through additional debt or equity financing, which may include sales of securities under our existing shelf registration statement on Form S-3,\nincluding under the Sales Agreement with B. Riley, or under a new registration statement.\n41\nTable of Contents\nOur efforts to raise additional funding may divert our management from its day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and\ncommercialize our products. In addition, we cannot guarantee that financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nMoreover, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders and the issuance of additional securities, whether\nequity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The sale of additional equity or\nconvertible securities would dilute all of our stockholders. Potential indebtedness in addition to our current facility with SWK, if incurred, would result in\nincreased fixed payment obligations, and we may be required to agree to further certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur\nadditional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact\nour ability to conduct our business. We may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or products or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable\nto us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.\nIf funding for our operations is not available or not available on terms acceptable to us, our strategic plans may be limited. In addition, in order to address\nour current funding constraints, we may be required to further revise our business plan and strategy, which may result in us (i) significantly curtailing,\ndelaying or discontinuing our DFD-29 research or development programs or the commercialization of any other products, (ii) selling certain of our assets\nand/or (iii) being unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities. Such measures may become necessary whether or\nnot we are able to raise additional capital. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially affected.\nRisks Related to Development and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates\nOur business is dependent on the successful development and regulatory approval of our current and any future product candidates.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our major marketed products that have been approved by the FDA for sale in the United States include Qbrexza®, Accutane®,\nAmzeeq®, Zilxi®, Exelderm®, Targadox® and Luxamend®. However, our business remains dependent on the successful development and regulatory\napproval of additional product candidates.\nOn June 29, 2021, we entered into a license, collaboration, and assignment agreement with DRL to initiate a Phase III clinical development program for a\ncollaborative product candidate, DFD-29, that is being evaluated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea. The success of our business,\nincluding our ability to finance our company and generate additional revenue in the future, may depend on the successful development and regulatory\napproval of the DFD-29 product candidate and any future product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire.\nThe clinical success of our current and any future product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n● our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all;\n● timely completion of our clinical trials, which may be significantly slower or cost more than we currently anticipate and will depend substantially\nupon the performance of third-party contractors as well as our ability to timely recruit and enroll patients in our clinical trials, which may be delayed\ndue to numerous factors, including the prevalence of other companies’ clinical trials for their product candidates for the same or similar indications;\n● whether we are required by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies to conduct additional clinical trials or other studies beyond those planned\nto support the approval and commercialization of our current or any future product candidates;\n● acceptance of our proposed indications and primary endpoint assessments relating to the proposed indications of our current or any future product\ncandidates by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities;\n● our ability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities the safety, efficacy and acceptable risk to benefit\nprofile of our current or any future product candidates;\n● the prevalence, duration and severity of potential side effects experienced with our current or any future product candidates;\n● the timely receipt of necessary marketing approvals from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities;\n42\nTable of Contents\n● achieving and maintaining, and, where applicable, ensuring that our third-party contractors achieve and maintain, compliance with our contractual\nobligations and with all regulatory requirements applicable to our current or any future product candidates;\n● our ability to successfully obtain the substances and materials used in our current or any future product candidates from third parties and to have\nfinished products manufactured by third parties in accordance with regulatory requirements and in sufficient quantities for preclinical and clinical\ntesting;\n● the ability of third parties with whom we contract to manufacture clinical trial supplies of our current or any future product candidates, remain in\ngood standing with regulatory agencies and develop, validate and maintain commercially viable manufacturing processes that are compliant with\ncGMP; and\n● a continued acceptable safety profile during clinical development of our current or any future product candidates.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant\ndelays or an inability to successfully complete and obtain regulatory approvals of our current or any future product candidates, which could materially\nadversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nClinical drug development is very expensive, time-consuming and uncertain. Our clinical trials may fail to adequately demonstrate the safety and\nefficacy of our current or any future product candidates, which could prevent or delay regulatory approval and commercialization.\nClinical drug development is very expensive, time-consuming and difficult to design and implement, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Before\nobtaining regulatory approval for the commercial sale of a product candidate, we must demonstrate through clinical trials that a product candidate is both\nsafe and effective for use in the target indication. Most product candidates that commence clinical trials are never approved by regulatory authorities for\ncommercialization. The clinical trials for these product candidates may take significantly longer than expected to complete. In addition, we, any partner with\nwhich we currently or may in the future collaborate, the FDA, an institutional review board (“IRB”) or other regulatory authorities, including state and local\nagencies and counterpart agencies in foreign countries, may suspend, delay, require modifications to or terminate our clinical trials at any time, for various\nreasons, including:\n● discovery of serious or unexpected adverse events, toxicities, or side effects experienced by study participants or other safety issues;\n● lack of effectiveness of any product candidate during clinical trials or the failure of a product candidate to meet specified endpoints;\n● slower than expected rates of subject recruitment and patient enrollment in clinical trials resulting from numerous factors, including the prevalence\nof other companies’ clinical trials for their product candidates for the same indication, such as atopic dermatitis;\n● difficulty in retaining subjects who have initiated participation in a clinical trial but may withdraw at any time due to adverse side effects from the\ntherapy, insufficient efficacy, fatigue with the clinical trial process or for any other reason;\n● difficulty in obtaining IRB approval for studies to be conducted at each site;\n● delays in manufacturing or obtaining, or inability to manufacture or obtain, sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials;\n● inadequacy of or changes in our manufacturing process or the product formulation or method of delivery;\n● changes in applicable laws, regulations and regulatory policies;\n● delays or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms in clinical trial contracts or protocols with prospective CROs, clinical trial sites and other\nthird-party contractors;\n43\nTable of Contents\n● inability to add a sufficient number of clinical trial sites;\n● uncertainty regarding proper dosing;\n● failure of our contract research organizations (“CROs”) or other third-party contractors to comply with contractual and regulatory requirements or to\nperform their services in a timely or acceptable manner;\n● failure by us, our employees, our CROs or their employees or any partner with which we may collaborate or their employees to comply with\napplicable FDA or other regulatory requirements relating to the con-duct of clinical trials or the handling, storage, security and recordkeeping for\ndrug and biologic products;\n● scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions;\n● failure to design appropriate clinical trial protocols;\n● inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols;\n● difficulty in maintaining contact with subjects during or after treatment, which may result in incomplete data; or\n● insufficient data to support regulatory approval.\nWe or any partner with which we may collaborate may suffer significant setbacks in our clinical trials similar to the experience of a number of other\ncompanies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, even after receiving promising results in earlier trials. In the event that we or our potential\npartners abandon or are delayed in the clinical development efforts related to our current or any future product candidates, we may not be able to execute on\nour business plan effectively and our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects would be harmed.\nWe expect to rely on third-party CROs and other third parties to conduct and oversee our clinical trials, other aspects of our product development and\nour regulatory submission process for our product candidates. If these third parties do not meet our requirements, conduct the trials as required or\notherwise provide services as anticipated, we may not be able to satisfy our contractual obligations or obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully\ncommercialize, our current or any future product candidates when expected or at all.\nWe expect to rely on third-party CROs and other third parties to conduct and oversee our clinical trials, other aspects of our product development and our\nregulatory submission process. We will also rely upon various medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct our trials in\naccordance with our clinical protocols and all applicable regulatory requirements, including the FDA’s regulations and GCPs, which are meant to protect\nthe rights, integrity, and confidentiality of study subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors, and state regulations\ngoverning the handling, storage, security and recordkeeping for drug and biologic products. These CROs and other third parties play a significant role in the\nconduct of our clinical trials, the subsequent collection and analysis of data from the clinical trials, the preparation for and submission of our filings with the\nFDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities and the successful commercialization of our product.\nWe rely heavily on third parties for the execution of our clinical trials and preclinical studies, and control only certain aspects of their activities. For\nexample, our agreement with DRL for the regulatory submission and approval for DFD-29 is heavily reliant on DRL’s ability to conduct clinical\nmanufacturing for clinical supply of product, attending FDA meetings, advising on the Phase III study design, assisting in identifying third-party CROs, and\ndrafting and advising on the NDA and other regulatory submissions. We and our CROs and other third-party contractors are required to comply with GCP\nand GLP requirements, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for products in clinical\ndevelopment. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP and GLP requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and\ntrial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable GCP and GLP requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may\nbe deemed unreliable and the FDA or other regulatory authorities may not accept or data, or may require us to perform additional clinical trials before\napproving our or our partners’ marketing applications. We cannot provide assurances that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory\nauthority will determine that any of our clinical trials or preclinical studies complies with applicable GCP and GLP requirements. In addition, our clinical\ntrials must generally be conducted with products manufactured and produced under cGMP\n44\nTable of Contents\nregulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations and policies may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval\nprocess.\nIf any of our CROs or clinical trial sites terminate their involvement in our clinical trials for any reason, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with\nalternative CROs or clinical trial sites in a timely manner, or do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, if our relationship with clinical\ntrial sites is terminated, we may experience the loss of follow-up information on patients enrolled in our ongoing clinical trial unless we are able to transfer\nthe care of those patients to another qualified clinical trial site. In addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or\nconsultants to us from time to time and could receive cash compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related\ncompensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be questioned by\nthe FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nAdditionally, the regulatory submission process for a product candidate is complex. We expect to rely on a third-party service provider for the preparation\nand submission of filings with the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval of our current and any future product candidates. Our\nreliance on third-party CROs may adversely affect our development timelines if the third-party CROs do not meet the requirements or satisfy the\nobligations required to obtain regulatory approval. Any significant delays caused by our collaboration partner or third-party CROs may have an adverse\neffect on our development timelines or otherwise may delay approval and commercialization of DFD-29. If our relationship with such service provider is\nterminated prior to completion of our regulatory submission process, we may not be able to enter into an arrangement with an alternative service provider\nin a timely manner, or do so on commercially reasonable terms, and our submission may be substantially delayed.\nWe are currently dependent on DRL for the manufacture and clinical supply of DFD-29 drug product. Any interruption in our supply may cause\nserious delays in the timing of our clinical trials, increase our costs and adversely impact our financial results.\nPursuant to the terms of our agreement with DRL for the exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize DFD-29 for the evaluation of treatment,\namong other potential indications, inflammatory lesions of rosacea (the “DFD-29 Agreement”), DRL is responsible for the manufacture and supply to us of\nDFD-29 drug product and we are completely reliant upon DRL to provide us with adequate supply for our use. We may experience an interruption in\nsupply if, among other reasons, we incorrectly forecast our supply requirements, DRL allocates supply to its own development programs, DRL incorrectly\nplans its manufacturing production or DRL is unable to manufacture DFD-29 drug product in a timely manner to match our development or commercial\nneeds. Transferring technology to a new manufacturer will require additional processes, technologies and validation studies, which are costly, may take\nconsiderable amounts of time, may not be successful and require review and approval by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory bodies. Such\nmanufacturer must comply with cGMP requirements enforced by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory bodies through facilities inspection programs\nand review of submitted technical information.\nWe may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our current or any of our future product candidates under applicable regulatory requirements. The\nFDA and foreign regulatory bodies have substantial discretion in the approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of product\ncandidates. The delay, limitation or denial of any regulatory approval would adversely impact our business and our operating results.\nWe may never obtain regulatory approval to commercialize our current or any future product candidates. The research, testing, manufacturing, safety\nsurveillance, efficacy, quality control, recordkeeping, labeling, packaging, storage, approval, sale, marketing, distribution, import, export and reporting of\nsafety and other post-market information related to our current and any future product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other\nregulatory authorities in the United States and in foreign countries, and such regulations differ from country to country. We are not permitted to market any\nof our current or any future product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA, BLA or other applicable regulatory filing from\nthe FDA. We are also not permitted to market our product or our current or any future product candidates in any foreign countries until we receive the\nrequisite approval from the applicable regulatory authorities of such countries.\nTo gain approval to market a new drug, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities must receive preclinical, clinical and chemistry, manufacturing and\ncontrols data that adequately demonstrate the safety, purity, potency, efficacy and compliant manufacturing of the product for the intended indication\napplied for in an NDA, BLA or other applicable regulatory filing. The development and approval of new drug products and biologic products involves a\nlong, expensive and uncertain process. A delay or failure can occur at any stage in the process. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and\nbiopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, including in Phase 3 clinical development, even after promising results in\nearlier preclinical studies or clinical trials. These\n45\nTable of Contents\nsetbacks have been caused by, among other things, findings made while clinical trials were underway and safety or efficacy observations made in clinical\ntrials, including previously unreported adverse events. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be\nsuccessful, and the results of clinical trials by other parties may not be indicative of the results in trials we or our partners may conduct.\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory bodies have substantial discretion in the drug approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of\nproduct candidates for many reasons, including:\n● the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may disagree with the design, implementation, choice of dose, analysis plans or interpretation of\nthe outcome of one or more clinical trials;\n● the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may not deem a product candidate safe and effective for its proposed indication, or may deem a\nproduct candidate’s safety or other perceived risks to out-weigh its clinical or other benefits;\n● the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may not find the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials, including the number of subjects\nin the safety database, sufficient to support approval, or the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance\nrequired by the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body for approval;\n● the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may disagree with our interpretation of data from pre-clinical studies or clinical trials performed\nby us or third parties, or with the interpretation of any partner with which we may collaborate;\n● the data collected from clinical trials may not be sufficient to support the submission and approval of an NDA, BLA or other applicable regulatory\nfiling;\n● the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n● the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency may identify deficiencies in the formulation, manufacturing, quality control, labeling or\nspecifications of our current or any future product candidates;\n● the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency may require clinical trials in pediatric patients in order to establish pharmacokinetics or safety\nfor this more drug-sensitive population;\n● the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional post-approval clinical\ntrials;\n● the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency may grant approval but impose substantial and costly post-approval requirements;\n● the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency may approve our current or any future product candidates for a more limited indication or a\nnarrower patient population than we originally requested;\n● the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agency may not approve the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful\ncommercialization of our current or any future product candidates;\n● the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may not approve of the manufacturing processes, controls or facilities of third-party\nmanufacturers or testing labs with which we contract; or\n● the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations in a manner rendering our clinical data\nor regulatory filings insufficient for approval.\nOf the large number of drugs and biologics in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA or other regulatory approval processes\nand are commercialized. Our current and any future product candidates may not be approved by the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agencies even\nthough they meet specified endpoints in our clinical trials. The FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agencies may ask us to conduct additional costly and\ntime-consuming clinical trials in order to obtain marketing approval or\n46\nTable of Contents\napproval to enter into an advanced phase of development, or may change the requirements for approval even after such agency has reviewed and\ncommented on the design for the clinical trials. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approval for any of our product\ncandidates would delay or prevent commercialization of our current and any future product candidates and would harm our business, financial condition,\noperating results and prospects.\nWe may conduct clinical trials for our current and any future product candidates, in whole or in part, outside of the United States and the FDA and\napplicable foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data from such trials, which would likely result in additional costs to us and delay our business\nplan.\nWe may in the future choose to conduct, one or more of our clinical trials outside the United States. Although the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory\nauthority may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States or the applicable jurisdiction, acceptance of such study data by the FDA\nor applicable foreign regulatory authority may be subject to certain conditions. Where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the basis for\nmarketing approval in the United States, the FDA will not approve the application on the basis of foreign data alone unless those data are applicable to the\nU.S. population and U.S. medical practice; the studies were performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence; and the data are considered valid\nwithout the need for an on-site inspection by the FDA or, if the FDA considers such an inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data\nthrough an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. Many foreign regulatory bodies have similar requirements. In addition, such foreign studies\nwould be subject to the applicable local laws of the foreign jurisdictions where the studies are conducted. There can be no assurance the FDA or applicable\nforeign regulatory authority will accept data from trials conducted outside of the United States or the applicable jurisdiction. If the FDA or applicable\nforeign regulatory authority does not accept such data, it would likely result in the need for additional clinical trials, which would be costly and time-\nconsuming and delay aspects of our business plan.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property, Generic Competition and Paragraph IV Litigation\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not\nsufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully\ncommercialize our technology and products may be impaired.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection in the United States and other\ncountries with respect to our products or any current or future product candidates that we may license or acquire and our manufacturing methods, as well as\nsuccessfully defending these patents and trade secrets against third-party challenges, which is expensive and time-consuming. A patent is the grant of a\nproperty right which allows its holder to exclude others from, among other things, selling the subject invention in, or importing such invention into, the\njurisdiction that granted the patent. We have obtained, acquired or in-licensed a number of patents and patent applications covering key aspects of certain of\nour principal products. In the aggregate, our patents are of material importance to our business taken as a whole. We seek to protect our proprietary position\nby filing or obtaining licenses under patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our products and any other current or future product\ncandidates. We will only be able to protect our technologies from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents cover\nthem. Our success is predicated, in part, by our ability to maintain the integrity of our trade secrets.\nIt is possible that we or our licensors will fail to timely identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain\npatent protection, which may result in third parties using our proprietary information, impairing our abilities to compete in the market, to generate revenues,\nand to achieve profitability. Moreover, should we enter into other collaborations, we may be required to consult with or cede control to collaborators\nregarding the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of our patents. Therefore, such patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a\nmanner consistent with the best interests of our business. The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file\nand prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in\nrecent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical or\nbiotechnology patents has emerged to date in the U.S. The patent situation outside the U.S. is even more uncertain. The laws of foreign countries may not\nprotect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of\nthe human body more than United States law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent\napplications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen (18) months after a first filing, if at all. Therefore, we\ncannot know with certainty whether we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent\napplications,\n47\nTable of Contents\nor that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. In the event that a third party has also filed a U.S. patent application relating to any\ncurrent or future product candidates or a similar invention, we may have to participate in derivation proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine\nproper inventorship of a claimed invention. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts would be unsuccessful,\nresulting in a material adverse effect on our U.S. patent position. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent\nrights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in\nwhole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or\ninterpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nAccordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents.\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or\ndefense of our issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the “Leahy-Smith Act”), was signed into law. The Leahy-\nSmith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are\nprosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The United States Patent Office recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern\nadministration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first-\ninventor-to-file provisions, which became effective on March 16, 2013. Courts continue to consider the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Leahy-\nSmith Act, including the Supreme Court in a recent decision affecting inter partes review procedures. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the\nLeahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and\ncosts surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation,\nreexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or other administrative proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An\nadverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, render unenforceable, or invalidate, our patent rights,\nallow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us. We may also be unable to\nmanufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights, under which a license might not be available. In addition, if the breadth\nor strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license,\ndevelop, or commercialize our current or future product candidates.\nEven if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from\ncompeting with us, or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by\ndeveloping similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\nThe issuance of a patent does not foreclose challenges to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability. Therefore, our owned and licensed patents may\nbe challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being\nnarrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or\nidentical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the\ndevelopment, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such product candidates might expire before or shortly after such\nproduct candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others\nfrom commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nGeneric drug approvals and successful challenges against the validity of our patents may cause us to lose exclusivity of some of our products.\nIn the U.S., the Hatch-Waxman Act provides non-patent regulatory exclusivity for five years from the date of the first FDA approval of a new drug\ncompound in an NDA. The FDA, with one exception, is prohibited during those five years from accepting for filing a generic, or ANDA that references the\nNDA. In reference to the foregoing exception, if a patent is indexed in the FDA Orange Book for the new drug compound, a generic may file an ANDA\nfour years from the NDA approval date if it also files a Paragraph IV Certification with the FDA challenging the patent. Protection under the Hatch-\nWaxman Act will not prevent the filing or approval of another full NDA. However, the NDA applicant would be required to conduct its own pre-clinical\nand adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to independently demonstrate safety and effectiveness.\n48\nTable of Contents\nGeneric drug companies may submit applications seeking approval to market generic versions of our products. In connection with these applications,\ngeneric drug companies may seek to challenge the validity and enforceability of our patents through litigation and/or with the USPTO. Such challenges may\nsubject us to costly and time-consuming litigation and/or USPTO proceedings). Such challenges may subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation\nand/or USPTO proceedings. As a result of the loss of any patent protection from such litigation or USPTO proceedings, or the “at-risk” launch by a generic\ncompetitor of our products, our products could be sold at significantly lower prices, and we could lose a significant portion of sales of that product in a\nshort period of time, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nEnforcing our proprietary rights is difficult and costly and we may be unable to ensure their protection.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, as legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our\nrights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n● our licensors might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and issued patents;\n● our licensors might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n● others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate our products or our current or future product candidates’\ntechnologies;\n● it is possible that none of the pending patent applications licensed to us will result in issued patents;\n● the issued patents covering our products or any current or future product candidates may not provide a basis for commercially viable active\nproducts, may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be challenged and defeated by third parties;\n● we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; or\n● patent rights of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nFurthermore, competitors may infringe our issued patents or other intellectual property (collectively, our “IP”), which may require us to file infringement\nclaims, which is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome uncertain. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke counterclaims\nalleging that our IP rights are invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed or that we have infringed upon misappropriated others’ intellectual property. In\nresponse, a court may decide that a patent of ours is wholly or partially invalid or unenforceable, construe the patent’s claims narrowly, or refuse to stop the\naccused party from using the technology at issue.\nAdditionally, some of our products, including Accutane, Targadox and Exelderm, do not have patent protection because they are not eligible or qualify for\nsuch protection. This creates greater risk of competition with generic drug manufacturers and may otherwise adversely affect our business or result of\noperations.\nFurther, we rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, to maintain our competitive position. We enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality\nagreements to protect these trade secrets but cannot guarantee that counterparties will not breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information,\nincluding trade secrets. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated trade secrets is costly, difficult, and time consuming, and we\nmay be unable to obtain adequate remedy. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive\nposition would be harmed.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in any\nlitigation would harm our business.\nOur ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products or any current or future product candidates depends upon our ability to avoid infringing\nthe proprietary rights of third parties. There are many U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties in the\ndermatology field that cover numerous compounds and formulations in our targeted markets. Because of the uncertainty inherent in any patent or other\nlitigation involving proprietary rights, we and our licensors may not be successful in defending against intellectual property claims raised by third parties,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our results of\n49\nTable of Contents\noperations. Regardless of the outcome of any litigation, defending the litigation may be expensive, time-consuming and distracting to management. In\naddition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in\nissued patents that our commercial activities relating to our products or current or future product candidates may infringe. There could also be existing\npatents of which we are not aware that our products or current or future product candidates may inadvertently infringe.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries\ngenerally. If a third party claims that we infringe on their products or technology, in addition to costly and time-consuming litigation, we could face a\nnumber of issues, including:\n● diversion of management’s attention from our core business;\n● substantial damages for past infringement;\n● injunctions prohibiting us from selling or licensing our product unless the patent holder licenses the patent to us, which it would not be required to\ndo;\n● requirements that we pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses under our patents;\n● redesigning our processes so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time; and\n● harm to our reputation and subsequent adverse effect on the valuation of our securities and revenue.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and\ncould distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of\nhearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a\nsubstantial adverse effect on the valuation of our securities. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the\nresources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other\nresources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings\nmore effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or\nother proceedings could compromise our ability to compete in the marketplace. The occurrence of any of the above-described risks could materially\nadversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or\npharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to\nclaims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former\nemployers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in\nsubstantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nWe may need to license certain intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially\nreasonable terms.\nA third party may hold intellectual property rights, including patent rights, that are important or necessary to the development of our products or current or\nfuture product candidates. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products or current\nor future product candidates, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties, if available, on commercially reasonable\nterms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially. Our inability to obtain such rights on acceptable terms, or at all, could materially adversely\naffect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n50\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses and funding arrangements with third parties, or if we breach an agreement\nunder which we license rights to any product or future product candidate, we could lose rights that are important to our business.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under current or future license and funding agreements, our counterparties may have the right to terminate these\nagreements, in which event we might not be able to develop, manufacture, or market any product or utilize any technology that is covered by these\nagreements or may face other penalties under the agreements. Such an occurrence could materially and adversely affect the value of a product candidate\nbeing developed under any such agreement or could restrict our drug discovery activities. Termination of these agreements or reduction or elimination of\nour rights under these agreements may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated agreements with less favorable terms or cause us to lose our rights\nunder these agreements, including our rights to important intellectual property or technology. Further, any uncured, material breach under our license\nagreement with any current or future licensor could result in our loss of rights to our products or current or future product candidates and may lead to a\ncomplete termination of any future product development efforts.\nRisks Related to our Platform and Data\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks, or deficiencies in our or third parties’ cybersecurity.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure, and data to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business,\nwe collect, store, and transmit confidential information, including, but not limited to, information related to our intellectual property and proprietary\nbusiness information, personal information, and other confidential information. It is critical that we maintain such confidential information in a manner that\npreserves its confidentiality and integrity. Furthermore, we have outsourced elements of our operations to third party vendors, who each have access to our\nconfidential information, which increases our disclosure risk.\nWhile we recently implemented internal security and business continuity measures, our internal computer systems and those of current and future third\nparties on which we rely may fail and are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses and unauthorized access. Our information technology and other\ninternal infrastructure systems, including corporate firewalls, servers, data center facilities, lab equipment, and connection to the internet, face the risk of\nbreakdown or other damage or interruption from service interruptions, system malfunctions, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and\nelectrical failures, as well as security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, contractors, consultants, business partners, and/or\nother third parties, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties (including the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks,\nsocial engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information), each of which\ncould compromise our system infrastructure or lead to the loss, destruction, alteration, disclosure, or dissemination of, or damage or unauthorized access to,\nour data or data that is processed or maintained on our behalf, or other assets.\nIf such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our\nbusiness operations, and could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us. For example, in 2021, we were the victim of a cybersecurity\nincident that affected our accounts payable function and led to approximately $9.5 million in wire transfers being misdirected to fraudulent accounts. The\nmatter was reported to the FBI and remains under their investigation. The cybersecurity incident does not appear to have compromised any personally\nidentifiable information or protected health information. Fortress, as our controlling stockholder and supporting partner in our back-office functions,\nprovided us with $9.5 million to ensure our accounts payable operations continued to function smoothly. The $9.5 million of support was in the form of a\nrelated party note which the boards of both companies have agreed and converted into 1,476,044 shares of our common stock upon the consummation of\nour IPO in November 2021 at the IPO price. The federal government has been able to trace and seize the fraudulently transferred cryptocurrency associated\nwith the breach. Once the cryptocurrency has been converted back into U.S. dollars, we expect to receive a notification letter to initiate the return of the cash\nto the Company. This process could take as long as six months or more to complete. Given the recent market declines, volatility, and liquidity issues with\ncryptocurrency, there is no certainty as to the amount we will ultimately recover. We may incur additional expenses and losses as a result of this\ncybersecurity incident, including related to investigation fees and remediation costs.\nIn addition, the loss or corruption of, or other damage to, clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory\napproval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties for the manufacture of our drug\ncandidates or any future drug candidates and to conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to\n51\nTable of Contents\ntheir systems and operations could also have a material adverse effect on our business and lead to regulatory agency actions. The risk of a security breach or\ndisruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally\nincreased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Sophisticated cyber\nattackers (including foreign adversaries engaged in industrial espionage) are skilled at adapting to existing security technology and developing new\nmethods of gaining access to organizations’ sensitive business data, which could result in the loss of proprietary information, including trade secrets. We\nmay not be able to anticipate all types of security threats, and we may not be able to implement preventive measures effective against all such security\nthreats. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched, and can originate from a wide variety of sources,\nincluding outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, or hostile foreign governments or agencies.\nAny security breach or other event leading to the loss or damage to, or unauthorized access, use, alteration, disclosure, or dissemination of, personal\ninformation, including personal information regarding clinical trial subjects, contractors, directors, or employees, our intellectual property, proprietary\nbusiness information, or other confidential or proprietary information, could directly harm our reputation, enable competitors to compete with us more\neffectively, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, or\notherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information. Each of the foregoing could result\nin significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damage that could adversely affect our business. Notifications and follow-up actions related to a\nsecurity incident could impact our reputation or cause us to incur substantial costs, including legal and remediation costs, in connection with these measures\nand otherwise in connection with any actual or suspected security breach. We expect to incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security\nincidents and otherwise implement our internal security and business continuity measures, and actual, potential, or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur\nincreasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and\nconsultants. We may face increased costs and find it necessary or appropriate to expend substantial resources in the event of an actual or perceived security\nbreach.\nThe costs related to significant security breaches or disruptions could be material and our insurance policies may not be adequate to compensate us for the\npotential losses arising from any such disruption in, or failure or security breach of, our systems or third-party systems where information important to our\nbusiness operations or commercial development is stored or processed. In addition, such insurance may not be available to us in the future on economically\nreasonable terms, or at all. Further, our insurance may not cover all claims made against us and could have high deductibles in any event, and defending a\nsuit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management attention. Furthermore, if the information technology systems of our third-party vendors\nand other contractors and consultants become subject to disruptions or security breaches, we may have insufficient recourse against such third parties and\nwe may have to expend significant resources to mitigate the impact of such an event, and to develop and implement protections to prevent future events of\nthis nature from occurring.\nRisks Related to Our Finances and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred net losses in recent fiscal years, and we may incur losses for the foreseeable future and may not be able to achieve or maintain\nprofitability.\nEven though we are a cash generating, commercial organization, we have a limited operating history. We have focused primarily on in-licensing,\ndeveloping, commercializing and/or manufacturing and selling our products. Potential future losses, among other things, will have an adverse effect on our\nstockholders’ equity and working capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with commercialization and/or developing\npharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or if we will be able to maintain profitability. Any future net\nlosses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if:\n● our current or any future product candidates are approved for commercial sale, due to our ability to establish the necessary commercial\ninfrastructure to launch this product candidate without substantial delays, including hiring sales and marketing personnel and contracting with third\nparties for warehousing, distribution, cash collection and related commercial activities;\n● we acquire or in-license new products for development and/or sale;\n● we are required by the FDA, or foreign regulatory authorities, to perform studies in addition to those currently expected;\n52\nTable of Contents\n● there are any delays in completing our clinical trials or the development of our current or any future product candidates;\n● we execute other collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements that require us to make payments and/ or expend funds;\n● there are variations in the level of expenses related to our future development programs;\n● there are any product liability or intellectual property infringement lawsuits in which we may become involved;\n● there are any regulatory developments affecting our products, current or future product candidates, or the product candidates of our competitors; or\n● the level of underlying demand for our products and wholesalers’ buying patterns.\nOur ability to maintain profitability depends upon our ability to generate and sustain revenue. Our ability to generate and sustain revenue depends on a\nnumber of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:\n● obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products, or any other current or future product candidates that we may license or acquire;\n● manufacture commercial quantities of our current products or current or future product candidates, if approved, at acceptable cost levels; and\n● maintain and/or expand our commercial organization and the supporting infrastructure required to successfully market and sell our products or\ncurrent or future product candidates, if approved.\nEven if we do achieve sustainable profitability, we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to remain\nprofitable would depress our value and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain or initiate any research and development\nefforts, diversify our product offerings or even continue our operations. A decline in our value could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nWe may need additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate any future\nproduct development programs or commercialization, manufacturing and/or sales efforts.\nSelling and developing products for dermatological use, conducting clinical trials, establishing outsourced manufacturing relationships and successfully\nmanufacturing and marketing drugs that we may develop is expensive. We may need to raise additional capital to:\n● fund our operations and continue our efforts to hire additional personnel;\n● qualify and outsource the commercial-scale manufacturing of our products under cGMP; and\n● acquire, in-license and/ or develop additional product candidates.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n● the potential for delays in our efforts to seek regulatory approval for any current or future product candidates, and any costs associated with such\ndelays;\n● the costs of maintaining and/or establishing a commercial organization to sell, market and distribute our products and/or current or future product\ncandidates;\n● the rate of progress and costs of our efforts to prepare for the submission of NDA or BLA for any product candidates that we may in-license or\nacquire in the future, and the potential that we may need to conduct additional clinical trials to support applications for regulatory approval;\n53\nTable of Contents\n● the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights associated with any current or future\nproduct candidates, including any such costs we may be required to expend if licensors are unwilling or unable to do so;\n● the cost and timing of securing sufficient supplies of our products and current or future product candidates from our contract manufacturers in\npreparation for commercialization, manufacture, and/or sale;\n● the effect of competing technological and market developments;\n● the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, co-promotion or other arrangements that we may establish;\n● the potential that we may be required to file a lawsuit to defend our patent rights or regulatory exclusivities from challenges by companies seeking\nto market generic versions of our branded products; and\n● the success of sales efforts of our current products and/or the commercialization of any current or future product candidates.\nFuture capital requirements will also depend on the extent to which we acquire or invest in additional complementary businesses, products and technologies,\nbut we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions.\nWe may need to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements,\nas well as through interest income earned on cash and investment balances. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable\nterms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of future development\nprograms, acquisition plans or our future commercialization efforts, which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects and the trading price of\nour common stock.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms\nof these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available,\nmay involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital\nexpenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have\nto relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be\nfavorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or\nterminate future product development or current or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would\notherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nIf we fail to raise the additional funds needed to complete the development of our current products or current or future product candidates, or the funds\nneeded to complete the development of our current or future product candidates, we will be unable to execute our current business plan.\nRisks Related to Owning our Common Stock\nIf we fail to maintain or implement effective internal controls, we may not be able to report financial results accurately or on a timely basis, or to detect\nfraud, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and the per share price of our common stock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control over financial\nreporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be\ndisclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC\nrules and forms. We are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting. We have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to\nexpend, significant resources in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\n54\nTable of Contents\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses\nin our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective\ncontrols, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting\nobligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control\nover financial reporting could also adversely affect the results of management reports and independent registered public accounting firm audits of our\ninternal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective\ndisclosure controls and procedures, and ineffective internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported\nfinancial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to\ncontinue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”).\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is not required to audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until after we are\nno longer an “emerging growth company” (“EGC”), as defined in the JOBS Act. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue\na report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed or\noperating.\nAny failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have a material and adverse effect on our business\nand operating results, and cause a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and other corporate governance changes.\nOur Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our\nCompany. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of\ndirectors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions include certain provisions that:\n● permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;\n● provide that, after a removal for cause, vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though\nless than a quorum;\n● prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n● require majority voting to amend our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n● authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n● restrict the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware or federal courts;\n● establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by\nstockholders at annual stockholder meetings; and\n● bestow majority control of the stockholder vote to Fortress by virtue of their exclusive ownership of our Class A Common Stock.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large\nstockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a period of time without the\napproval of our board of directors. In addition, our credit facility includes, and other debt instruments we may enter into in the future may include,\nprovisions entitling the lenders to demand immediate repayment of all borrowings upon the occurrence of certain change of control events relating to our\ncompany, which also could discourage, delay or prevent a business combination transaction.\n55\nTable of Contents\nOur Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of\nDelaware is the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a chosen\njudicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation requires to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name,\nactions against directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions must be brought in the Court of Chancery in the State\nof Delaware or, if that court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, another federal or state court situated in the State of Delaware. Any person or entity\npurchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our\ncertificate of incorporation. In addition, our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United\nStates are the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or any of our\ndirectors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the\nchoice of forum provision contained in our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we\nmay incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial\ncondition.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert our management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain\nqualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are required to comply with the\napplicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of\nNasdaq, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations increases our legal and financial compliance\ncosts, makes some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increases demand on our systems and resources. Among other things, the\nExchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results and maintain effective disclosure\ncontrols and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. Significant resources and management oversight is required to maintain and, if\nrequired, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting to meet this standard. As a result, management’s\nattention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and operating results. Although we hired additional employees to\ncomply with these requirements, we may need to hire even more employees in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nReduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to us as an EGC could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an EGC and, as long as we continue to be an EGC, we may continue to avail ourselves of exemptions from various reporting requirements\napplicable to other public companies. Consequently, we are not required to have our independent registered public accounting firm audit our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and we are subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive\ncompensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive\ncompensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an EGC can\ntake advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As a result, our financial statements may not be\ncomparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of the dates such pronouncements are effective for public\ncompanies. We could be an EGC for up to five years following the completion of our November 2021 public offering. We will cease to be an EGC upon the\nearliest of: (i) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the aforementioned offering, (ii) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenue\nis $1.235 billion or more, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt\nsecurities or (iv) the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the\nsecond quarter of that fiscal year. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions.\nIf some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for\nour common stock, and the price of our common stock may be more volatile.\n56\nTable of Contents\nOur shares of common stock are subject to potential delisting if we do not continue to maintain the listing requirements of Nasdaq.\nWe list our shares of common stock on Nasdaq under the symbol “DERM.” Nasdaq has rules for continued listing, including, without limitation, minimum\nmarket capitalization and other requirements. Failure to maintain our listing, or de-listing from Nasdaq, would make it more difficult for shareholders to sell\nour securities and more difficult to obtain accurate price quotations on our securities. This could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nOur ability to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes, or otherwise to arrange for any financing we may need in the future, may also be\nmaterially and adversely affected if our common stock is not traded on a national securities exchange.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole\nsource of gains.\nWe currently intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the\nforeseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. In addition, the terms of our existing\ndebt arrangements preclude us from paying dividends and our future debt agreements, if any, may contain similar restrictions. As a result, you may only\nreceive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases.\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock is likely to be volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nThe trading price of our common stock fluctuates substantially. These fluctuations could cause you to incur substantial losses, including all of your\ninvestment in our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include the following:\n● significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of companies in our industry;\n● announcements of new solutions or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions, or other events by us or our competitors;\n● price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n● changes in how customers perceive the benefits of our products and future offerings;\n● the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\n● fluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float;\n● actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations or financial projections;\n● changes in actual or future expectations of investors or securities analysts;\n● litigation involving us, our industry, or both;\n● governmental or regulatory actions or audits;\n● regulatory developments applicable to our business, including those related to privacy in the United States or globally;\n● general economic conditions and trends;\n● major catastrophic events in our domestic and foreign markets; and\n● departures of key employees.\n57\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to our Relationship with Fortress Biotech, Inc.\nFortress controls a voting majority of our common stock, which could be detrimental to our other shareholders.\nPursuant to the terms of the Class A Common Stock held by Fortress, Fortress will be entitled to cast, for each share of Class A Common Stock held by\nFortress, the number of votes that is equal to 1.1 times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of our outstanding common stock and the\ndenominator of which is the number of shares of outstanding Class A Common Stock (the “Class A Common Stock Ratio”). Thus, Fortress will at all times\nhave voting control of Journey. Further, for a period of ten (10) years from the date of the first issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock, the holders of\nrecord of the shares of Class A Common Stock (or other capital stock or securities issued upon conversion of or in exchange for the Class A Common\nStock), exclusively and as a separate class, shall be entitled to appoint or elect the majority of the directors of Journey. This concentration of voting power\nmay delay, prevent or deter a change in control of us even when such a change may be in the best interests of all stockholders, could deprive our\nstockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of common stock as part of a sale of Journey or our assets, and might affect the\nprevailing market price of our common stock.\nWe are a “controlled company” within the meaning of Nasdaq listing standards and, as a result, qualify for exemptions from certain corporate\ngovernance requirements. Although we do not presently intend to take advantage of these exemptions, we may do so in the future.\nWe are a “controlled company” within the meaning of Nasdaq listing standards. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power\nis held by an individual, a group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance\nrequirements of Nasdaq, including (i) the requirement that a majority of the Board of Directors consist of independent directors, (ii) the requirement that we\nhave a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the\ncommittee’s purpose and responsibilities and (iii) the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent\ndirectors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities. Although we presently are not taking advantage of these\nexemptions, we may do so in the future. Accordingly, our stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are\nsubject to all of the corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq. Investors may find our common stock less attractive as a result of our reliance on these\nexemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our\nstock price may be more volatile.\nWe may have received better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we receive in our arrangements with Fortress.\nWe have arrangements with Fortress in connection with management and administration services for the Company. While we believe the terms of these\narrangements are reasonable, they might not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm’s-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties. The\nterms of the arrangement relate to, among other things, systems, insurance, accounting, legal, finance, tax and human resources. We might have received\nbetter terms from third parties because, among other things, third parties might have competed with each other to win our business.\nThe ownership by our executive officers and some of our directors of shares of equity securities of Fortress and/or rights to acquire equity securities of\nFortress might create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest.\nBecause of their current or former positions with Fortress, some of our executive officers and directors own shares of Fortress common stock and/or\noptions to purchase shares of Fortress common stock. Their individual holdings of common stock and/or options to purchase common stock of Fortress may\nbe significant compared to their total assets. Ownership by our directors and officers, after our separation, of common stock and/or options to purchase\ncommon stock of Fortress might appear to create conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different\nimplications for Fortress than for us.\n58\nTable of Contents\nFortress’ current or future financial obligations and arrangements, or an event of default thereon, may change the ownership dynamic of us by\nFortress.\nAny default or breach by Fortress under any current or future credit agreement or arrangements may have an adverse effect on our business. Fortress has\npledged as collateral to certain of its creditors equity in the Company. If Fortress were to default on its obligations to any such creditor, that creditor, whose\ninterests may not align with those of our other stakeholders, could acquire a controlling interest in the Company. In addition, Fortress’ current credit\nagreement with Oaktree Capital (the “Oaktree Credit Agreement”) contains certain affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that apply in\ndifferent instances to Fortress itself, its private subsidiaries, its public subsidiaries, or combinations of the foregoing. Although we are not a party to the\nOaktree Credit Agreement, because Fortress controls our stockholder vote, Fortress may not permit us to effect certain actions which we feel would be in\nthe Company’s best interests, but which Fortress cannot allow so as to remain in compliance with the Oaktree Credit Agreement.\nGeneral Risks\nFailure to manage our growth effectively could cause our business to suffer and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial\ncondition.\nWe have experienced significant growth in a short period of time. To manage our growth effectively, we must continually evaluate and evolve our\norganization. We must also manage our employees, operations, finances and capital investments efficiently. Our efficiency, productivity and the quality of\nour products may be adversely impacted if we do not train our new personnel, particularly our sales and support personnel, quickly and effectively, or if we\nfail to appropriately coordinate across our organization. Additionally, our rapid growth may place a strain on our resources, infrastructure and ability to\nmaintain the quality of our products. You should not consider our revenue growth and levels of profitability in recent periods as indicative of future\nperformance. In future periods, our revenue or profitability could decline or grow more slowly than we expect. Failure to manage our growth effectively\ncould cause our business to suffer and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our\nbusiness, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock partially depends on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business.\nWe do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us should downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our\nbusiness prospects, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to regularly publish\nreports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. If our estimates\nor judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), the SEC and\nvarious bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant\neffect on our reported results of operations and could affect the reporting of transactions already completed before the announcement of a change.\n59\nTable of Contents\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported\nin our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K. We base our estimates on historical\nexperience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as discussed in the section titled “Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.” The results of these estimates\nform the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily\napparent from other sources. Significant estimates, judgments, and assumptions used in our financial statements include, but are not limited to, those\nrelated to revenue recognition, accounts receivable and related reserves, useful lives and realizability of long-lived assets, research and development costs,\nassumptions used in the valuation of warrants, accounting for share-based compensation, and valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. These\nestimates are periodically reviewed for any changes in circumstances, facts, and experience. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our\nassumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the\nexpectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nGlobal and national financial events may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.\nA credit crisis, turmoil in the global or U.S. financial system, recession or similar possible events in the future could negatively impact us. A financial crisis\nor recession may limit our ability to raise capital through credit and equity markets. The prices for the products and services that we intend to provide may\nbe affected by a number of factors, and it is unknown how these factors may be impacted by a global or national financial event.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are erroneous or based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect,\nour operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported\nin the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on our best judgment, historical experience, information derived\nfrom third parties and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as discussed in the section titled\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” the results of which form the basis for making judgments\nabout the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our operating results may be\nadversely affected if our judgments prove to be wrong, assumptions change or actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could\ncause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price. Significant\nassumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, share-based compensation\nand income taxes.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition\nor results of operations.\nNew income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business\noperations and financial performance. For example, the United States recently passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides for a minimum tax equal\nto 15% of the adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations, as well as a 1% excise tax on certain share buybacks by public corporations\nthat would be imposed on such corporations. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to newly enacted federal tax\nlegislation. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of net deferred tax assets relating to our operations, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the\ndeductibility of expenses could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges, and could\nincrease our future U.S. tax expense.\n60\nTable of Contents\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nWe recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as such term is defined in Item\n106(a) of Regulation S-K. These risks include, among other things: operational risks, intellectual property theft, fraud, extortion, harm to employees or\ncustomers and violation of data privacy or security laws.\nIdentifying and assessing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes. Cybersecurity risks related to our\nbusiness, operations, privacy and compliance issues are identified and addressed through a multi-faceted approach. To defend, detect and respond to\ncybersecurity incidents, we, among other things: conduct proactive privacy and cybersecurity reviews of systems and applications, conduct employee\ntraining, monitor emerging laws and regulations related to data protection and information security and implement appropriate changes.\nWe have implemented a cybersecurity risk management program that leverages the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) framework,\nwhich organizes cybersecurity risks into five categories: identify, protect, detect, respond and recover. We regularly assess the threat landscape and take a\nholistic view of cybersecurity risks, with a layered cybersecurity strategy based on prevention, detection and mitigation.\nSecurity events and data incidents are evaluated, ranked by severity and prioritized for response and remediation. Our cybersecurity team collaborates with\nstakeholders across our business units to further analyze the risk to the company, and form detection, mitigation and remediation strategies. Our risk\nmanagement program also assesses third-party cybersecurity risks and we perform third-party risk management to identify and mitigate risks from third\nparties such as vendors, suppliers, and other business partners associated with our use of third-party service providers.\nWe describe whether and how risks from identified cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially\naffected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, under the heading\n“Our business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks, or deficiencies in our or third parties’ cybersecurity” in\nour risk factor disclosures in Item IA of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCybersecurity Governance\nCybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of focus for our management. Our executive management is responsible\nfor the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. Members of our board of directors receive updates from our executive management team regarding\nmatters of cybersecurity. This includes existing and new cybersecurity risks, status on how management is addressing and/or mitigating those risks,\ncybersecurity and data privacy incidents (if any) and status on key information security initiatives.\nOur cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes are overseen by leaders from our information security, compliance and legal teams. These\nindividuals are informed about, and monitor the prevention, mitigation, detection and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through their management of,\nand participation in, the cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes described above, including the operation of our incident response plan, and\nreport to our board of directors on any appropriate items.\nItem 2. Properties\nOur executive offices are located at 9237 E Via de Ventura Blvd. Suite 105, Scottsdale, AZ 85258. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate to\nmeet our current requirements. We do not own any real property.\nIn September 2022, we amended our lease and entered into a new 25-month extension of the office space in Scottsdale, AZ at an average annual rent of\n$0.1 million. The term of this amended lease commenced on January 1, 2023 and will expire on January 31, 2025.\n61\nTable of Contents\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nTo our knowledge, there are no legal proceedings pending against us, other than routine actions, administrative proceedings, and other actions not deemed\nmaterial, that are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. In the ordinary course of\nbusiness, however, the Company may be subject to both insured and uninsured litigation. Suits and claims may be brought against the Company by\ncustomers, suppliers, partners and/or third parties (including tort claims for personal injury arising from clinical trials of the Company’s product candidates\nand property damage) alleging deficiencies in performance, breach of contract, etc., and seeking resulting alleged damages.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\n62\nTable of Contents\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket information\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market and trades under the symbol “DERM.” We commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on\nNovember 12, 2021. Prior to November 12, 2021 there was no public market for our common stock.\nEquity Compensation Plans\nWe do not maintain any deferred compensation, retirement, pension or profit-sharing plans. Our board of directors has adopted an incentive plan, allowing\nfor the grant of equity and cash-based awards to our employees and directors.\nSales of Unregistered Securities\nNone.\nUse of Proceeds from Sales of Registered Securities\nOn December 30, 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333 - 269079), which was declared effective by the SEC on January\n26, 2023. This shelf registration statement covers the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to an aggregate of $150.0 million of the Company’s common\nstock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, and units (the “2022 Shelf”). In connection with the 2022 Shelf, we entered into an At Market Issuance\nSales Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with B. Riley Securities, Inc. (“B. Riley”), relating to shares of our common stock. In accordance with the terms\nof the Sales Agreement, we may offer and sell up to 4,900,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, from time to time through or to B.\nRiley acting as our agent or principal. During 2023, we issued 748,703 shares of common stock under the 2022 Shelf, generating net proceeds of $4.5\nmillion. At December 31, 2023, 4,151,297 shares remain available for issuance under the Sales Agreement.\nWe currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital, research and development,\npayments for research and development — licenses acquired, sales and marketing activities, general administrative matters, operating expenses and capital\nexpenditures.\nHolders\nAs of March 28, 2024, there were approximately 44 holders of record for our common stock and 1 holder of record for our Class A common stock. The\nactual number of stockholders is greater than this number of record holders and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners and whose shares are held\nin street name by brokers and other nominees. This number of holders of record also does not include stockholders whose shares may be held in trust by\nother entities.\nDividends\nWe have never paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock and currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and\ngrowth of our business.\nItem 6. [RESERVED.]\n63\nTable of Contents\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Statements\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial\nstatements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S.\nGAAP. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and\nSection 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Please see the section titled “Special Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-\nLooking Statements” elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the\ninformation set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” herein. As used below, the words “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Journey Medical Corporation and\nits consolidated subsidiaries.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company founded in October 2014 that focuses on the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical\nproducts for the treatment of dermatological conditions. Our current portfolio includes seven branded and two authorized generic prescription drugs for\ndermatological conditions that are marketed in the U.S. We are managed by experienced life science executives with a track record of creating value for\ntheir stakeholders and bringing novel medicines to the market, enabling patients to experience increased quality of life, and enabling physicians and other\nlicensed medical professionals to provide better care for their patients. We aim to acquire rights to future products by licensing or otherwise acquiring an\nownership interest in, funding the research and development of, and eventually commercializing, the products through our field sales organization. Since\ninception, we have made significant investments to build out our commercial product portfolios, which we believe, coupled with our experienced\ndermatology sales leadership team and field sales force, will position our business for growth. We are a majority-owned subsidiary of Fortress.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Uses of Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements\nrequires us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters\nthat are inherently uncertain in the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on\nvarious other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying\nvalue of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or\nconditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in greater detail in Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”\nin our consolidated financial statements, appearing under Part II, Item 8 and beginning at page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the\nfollowing accounting policies and estimates are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial\nstatements in understanding our historical and future performance. These policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments\nand estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are\nrecognized. Such variable consideration represents chargebacks, coupons, discounts, other sales allowances and sales returns. These deductions represent\nestimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross\nsales for a reporting period. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations have not been material to our overall\nbusiness. Coupons, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product revenue growth trends. If any of our ratios, factors,\nassessments, experiences, or judgments are not indicative or accurate estimates of our future experience, our results could be materially affected. The\npotential of our estimates to vary differs by program, product, type of customer and geographic location.\n64\nTable of Contents\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our consolidated financial statements, appearing under Part II, Item\n8 and beginning at page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about recent accounting pronouncements, the timing of their adoption, if\napplicable, and our assessment, if any, of their potential impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEmerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth\ncompanies can delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those\nstandards apply to private companies. Other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements under the JOBS Act for emerging growth companies include\npresentation of only two years of audited financial statements in our annual reports on Form 10-K, an exemption from the requirement to provide an\nauditor’s report on internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, an exemption from\nany requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation and less extensive\ndisclosure about our executive compensation arrangements. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised\naccounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that (i) we are no longer an emerging\ngrowth company or (ii) we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act.\nWe are also a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that either (i) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) the\nmarket value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million and our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently\ncompleted fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than\n$250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our shares held\nby non-affiliates is less than $700 million.

The decrease is primarily due to lower unit volumes from our legacy products, Targadox, Ximino and Exelderm driven specifically by\ncontinued generic competition for Targadox and the winding down, and ultimate discontinuation of Ximino, during the third quarter of 2023. Despite unit\nvolume increases from period-to-period for Qbrexza, Amzeeq and Zilxi, net revenues for these products were negatively impacted by higher managed care\nrebates due to higher managed care program costs. In addition, Qbrexza net revenue was negatively impacted by coupon deductible rate resets in the\nbeginning of 2023, and isolated charges in the first quarter of 2023 for higher-than-anticipated returns from the Dermira product lots purchased in 2021, as\nwell as higher government rebates from increases in certain state rebate programs. As of July 1, 2023, we no longer participate in these programs. Accutane\nnet product revenue increased $1.8 million from 2022 due to increased unit volume resulting from our focused sales and marketing efforts.\nOther revenue\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31, Change\n($in thousands) 2023 2022 $ %\nNon-refundable upfront payment from Maruho $ 19,000 $ — $ 19,000 100%\nNet milestone payment from Maruho — 2,500 (2,500) (100)%\nRoyalties on sales of Rapifort® Wipes 2.5% 519 174 345 198%\nTotal other revenue $ 19,519 $ 2,674 $ 16,845 630%\nOther revenues increased approximately $16.8 million, to $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $2.7 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes a $19.0 million non-refundable upfront payment from Maruho under\nthe New License Agreement. Royalties on sales of Rapifort Wipes 2.5% in Japan were $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to\n$0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes a net $2.5 million milestone payment\nfrom Maruho. In January 2022, Maruho received manufacturing and marketing approval in Japan for Rapifort Wipes 2.5% (Japanese equivalent to U.S.\nFDA approved QBREXZA®), for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, triggering the one-time net payment. Sales of Rapifort in Japan will no\nlonger be subject to a royalty after October 1, 2023 in accordance with the Second A&R License Agreement.\nGross - to - Net Sales Accruals\nWe record gross-to-net sales accruals for chargebacks, distributor service fees, prompt pay discounts, sales returns, coupons, managed care rebates,\ngovernment rebates, and other allowances customary to the pharmaceutical industry.\nGross-to-net sales accruals and the balance in the related allowance accounts for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nChargebacks Distributor Prompt Managed\nand other Service Pay Care Gov’t\n($’s in thousands) allowances Fees Discounts Returns Coupons Rebates Rebates Total\nBalance as of December 31, 2021 $ 622 $ 791 $ 197 $ 3,240 $ 4,992 $ 3,492 $ 690 $ 14,024\nCurrent provision related to sales in the\ncurrent period 2,663 5,868 1,104 5,387 117,883 22,654 3,651 159,210\nChecks/credits issued to third parties (3,032) (5,730) (1,094) (4,938) (121,179) (22,552) (3,331) (161,856)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 $ 253 $ 929 $ 207 $ 3,689 $ 1,696 $ 3,594 $ 1,010 $ 11,378\nCurrent provision related to sales in the\ncurrent period 1,856 5,439 976 5,483 94,822 22,934 5,191 136,701\nChecks/credits issued to third parties (2,016) (5,470) (1,041) (5,095) (93,074) (21,318) (5,948) (133,962)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 93 $ 898 $ 142 $ 4,077 $ 3,444 $ 5,210 $ 253 $ 14,117\n67\nTable of Contents\nThe increase in our reserves for gross-to-net sales accruals from period-to-period is driven by increases in our reserves for coupons and managed care\nrebates of $1.7 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Our provision for coupons was $3.4 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $1.7 million at\nDecember 31, 2022. The increase in the coupon reserve is primarily due to an increase in our channel reserve at December 31, 2023 for rebates not credited\nat the end of the year as a result of the timing of receipt. Our provision for managed care rebates was $5.2 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $3.6\nmillion at December 31, 2022. The increase in the managed care rebate reserve is primarily due to the timing of invoices received.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold decreased by $4.1 million, or 13%, to $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $30.8 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The decrease is mainly due to lower-than-prior-year product royalties driven by lower sales of products from period-to-period, and a\npermanent contractual decrease in the Qbrexza royalty percentage from the prior-year period.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense decreased by $3.4 million, or 31%, to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $10.9 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022. The decrease is related to lower clinical trial expenses to develop our DFD-29 product as the project winds down and\neventually concludes.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”)\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $15.6 million, or 26%, to $43.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $59.5\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease is mainly due to our expense reduction efforts primarily in sales and marketing and other\nSG&A areas. During the last quarter of 2022, we began implementing a cost reduction initiative designed to improve operational efficiencies, optimize\nexpenses, and reduce overall costs. The initiative is intended to reduce selling, general, and administrative expenses to better align costs with their revenue-\ngenerating capabilities. In connection with the cost reduction initiative, during the last quarter of 2022 and the first two quarters of 2023, we executed a\nheadcount reduction to our sales force and implemented marketing and other cost cuts.\nLoss on impairment of intangible assets\nWe recorded a loss on the impairment of intangible assets of $3.1 million during 2023 related to the impairment of the Ximino intangible asset as a result of\nlower net product revenues and gross profit levels for the Ximino products. We discontinued selling Ximino on September 29, 2023.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $0.3 million to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThis decrease was driven in part by the total repayment of our prior credit facility with East West Bank during the third quarter of 2023 and no additional\nborrowing of funds until entering into the Credit Facility with SWK in December 2023. As we utilize this Credit Facility during 2024 to help us fund our\noperations, we expect interest expenses may increase year-over-year from the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense increased by $0.2 million during 2023 due to an increase in certain state taxes driven by the Maruho New License Agreement.\n68\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOn December 27, 2023, we entered into the Credit Agreement with SWK. The Credit Agreement provides for a term loan Credit Facility in the original\nprincipal amount of up to $20.0 million. On the closing date, we drew $15.0 million. The remaining $5.0 million may be drawn upon our request within 12\nmonths after the closing date. The Term Loans mature on December 27, 2027, and bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the three-month term SOFR\n(subject to a SOFR floor of 5%) plus 7.75%. The interest rate resets quarterly. Interest payments begin in February 2024 and are paid quarterly. Beginning\nin February 2026, we are required to repay the outstanding principal of the Term Loans quarterly in an amount equal to 7.5% of the principal amount of\nfunded Term Loans. If our total revenue, measured on a trailing twelve-month basis, is greater than $70.0 million as of December 31, 2025, principal\nrepayment is not required until February 2027, at which point we are required to repay a portion of the outstanding principal of the Term Loans quarterly in\nan amount equal to 15% of the principal amount of funded Term Loans. The SWK Credit Facility also includes both revenue and liquidity covenants,\nrestrictions as to payment of dividends, and is secured by substantially all assets of the Company. As of December 31, 2023, and as of the date of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the SWK Credit Facility\nOn August 31, 2023, we entered into the New License Agreement with Maruho, whereby we granted an exclusive license to Maruho to develop and\ncommercialize Qbrexza® for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia,\nPhilippines, Singapore, Vietnam, Brunei, Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos (the “Territory”). Under the terms of the New License Agreement, in exchange for\nthe exclusive rights to Qbrexza® in the Territory, Maruho paid us $19.0 million as a non-refundable upfront payment.\nIn July 2023, we satisfied all of the outstanding debt obligations we had with East West Bank (“EWB”) by voluntarily repaying the outstanding balance on\nthe term loan under the Loan and Security Agreement, dated March 31, 2021 (as Amended, the “EWB facility”).\nOn December 30, 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333 - 269079), which was declared effective by the SEC on January\n23, 2023. This shelf registration statement covers the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to an aggregate of $150.0 million of our common stock,\npreferred stock, debt securities, warrants, and units (the “2022 Shelf”). In connection with the 2022 shelf, we have entered into the Sales Agreement with B.\nRiley relating to shares of our common stock in an at-the-market sales program. In accordance with the terms of the Sales Agreement, we may offer and\nsell up to 4,900,000 shares of our common stock, from time-to-time through B. Riley acting as our agent or principal. During 2023, we issued 748,703\nshares of common stock under the 2022 Shelf, generating net proceeds of $4.5 million. At December 31, 2023, 4,151,297 shares remain available for\nissuance under the 2022 Shelf.\nWe regularly evaluate market conditions, our liquidity profile, and financing alternatives, including out-licensing arrangements for our products, to enhance\nour capital structure. We may seek to raise capital through debt or equity financings, to expand our product portfolio, and for other strategic initiatives,\nwhich may include sales of securities under either our 2022 Shelf or a new registration statement or drawing on the SWK Credit Facility. We cannot make\nany assurances that such additional financing will be available to us and, if available, the terms may negatively impact our business and operations. At\nDecember 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $27.4 million. Our current assumptions, projected commercial sales of our\nproducts, clinical development plans and regulatory submission timelines are uncertain and may not emerge as expected. Additionally, as a result of\nrecurring losses, substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the date of issuance of\nthese financial statements.\nCash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nFor the Years ended December 31, Increase\n($’s in thousands) 2023 2022 (Decrease)\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 5,240 $ (13,534) $ 18,774\nNet cash used in investing activities (5,000) (20,000) 15,000\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities (4,804) 16,456 (21,260)\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents (4,564) (17,078) (12,514)\n69\nTable of Contents\nOperating Activities\nNet cash from operating activities changed by $18.8 million from period-to-period, from $13.5 million cash used in operating activities for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 to $5.2 million net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023. The change was driven primarily by the\nlower net loss from period-to-period, driven by our lower expense base and the $19.0 million payment from Maruho. This was offset by vendor payments\nas we utilized operating cash and the proceeds of the SWK facility to aggressively pay down our current liabilities.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $15.0 million, to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $20.0 million for the year\nended December 31, 2022. The year ended December 31, 2023 reflects the $5.0 million deferred cash payment paid in January 2023 related to the VYNE\nProduct Acquisition. The year ended December 31, 2022 reflects the upfront $20.0 million payment for the VYNE Product Acquisition.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities increased by $21.3 million, to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $16.5 million of cash flows\nprovided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase reflects a cash outflow of $20.0 million for the repayment of principal\non the EWB term loan and net cash outflows of $2.9 million from the repayment of the EWB revolving line of credit, offset by net proceeds of $14.6\nmillion from the SWK Term Loan and $4.5 million from the issuance of common stock under the 2022 Shelf. Net cash provided by financing activities for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 reflects net proceeds of $19.8 million from the EWB term loan and net proceeds of $2.1 million from the EWB\nrevolving line of credit, offset by $5.0 million in payments of the installment notes related to our previously acquired products.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into contractual obligations that contain cash requirements of which the most significant currently include the\nfollowing:\n● We are required to make regular payments under the SWK Credit Facility. Based on the amount currently outstanding under the SWK facility and\ncurrent interest rates, and assuming we do not make further draws under the SWK facility, we expect to make the following payments:\nPayments by Period\nTotal 2024 2025 2026 2027\n($’s in thousands)\nInterest $ 6,770 $ 1,998 $ 1,993 $ 1,693 $ 1,086\nPrincipal 15,000 — — 4,500 10,500\nExit fee 750 — — — 750\nTotal $ 22,520 $ 1,998 $ 1,993 $ 6,193 $ 12,336\nShould we elect to borrow the remaining $5.0 undrawn balance under the SWB facility, we would expect to repay additional amounts each year until\nmaturity.\n● Pursuant to the Vyne Product Acquisition Agreement, upon the achievement of net sales milestones with respect to the products purchased in the\nVyne Product Acquisition, we are also required to pay contingent consideration consisting of a one-time payment, per product, of $10.0 million and\n$20.0 million upon each product reaching annual net sales of $100 million and $200 million, respectively. Each required payment must only be paid\none time following the first achievement of the applicable annual net sales milestone amount.\n● On June 29, 2021, we entered into the DFD-29 Agreement to obtain the global rights for the development and commercialization of DFD-29 with\nDRL. Based on the development and commercialization of DFD-29, additional contingent regulatory and commercial milestone payments totaling\nup to $158.0 million may also become payable. Royalties ranging from ten percent to twenty percent are payable on net sales of the product.\nAdditionally, the Company was required to fund and\n70\nTable of Contents\noversee the Phase 3 clinical trials beginning upon the license of DFD-29 in 2021. The two Phase 3 clinical trials substantially concluded in July\n2023 upon the receipt of positive topline results from the trials. In January 2024, the Company paid a $4.0 million filing fee to the FDA upon filing\nof an NDA for DFD-29. The Company is obligated to make a $3.0 million milestone payment to DRL in April 2024 based on the FDA’s acceptance\nof the NDA filed in January 2024.\n● We are contractually obligated to make installment milestone payments of $3.0 million on Ximino, all of which is classified as current as it is due\nwithin a year of December 31, 2023.\n● We are contractually obligated to make sales-based royalty payments to Dermira (for Qbrexza), Sun Pharmaceutical Industries (for Exelderm) and\nPuraCap Caribe (for Targadox). Due to the contingent nature of these obligations, the amounts of these payments cannot be reasonably predicted as\nof the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 7A.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone.\n71\nTable of Contents\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, designed to ensure\nthat information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal\nexecutive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and\noperated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we are required to apply our judgment in evaluating the\ncost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report\non Form 10-K under the supervision, and with the participation, of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (who serves as our principal\nexecutive officer) and our Interim Chief Financial Officer (who serves as our principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of\nour disclosure controls and procedures.\nBased on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were\neffective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K in providing reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control\nobjectives.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act\nRules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our\nassets;\n(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP,\nand that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and directors; and\n(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of our assets that could\nhave a material effect on the financial statements.\nInternal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and\ncompliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be\ncircumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented\nor detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting\nprocess. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making the assessment,\nmanagement used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated\nFramework (2013). Based on the results of this assessment, management (including our Chief Executive Officer and our Interim Chief Financial Officer)\nhas concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting\nfirm due to our status as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act.\n72\nTable of Contents\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the\nExchange Act) during our most recent fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023 to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of\nthe years then ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in\nNote 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, and as a result has concluded that this raises\nsubstantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The\nconsolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these\nconsolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required\nto have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or\nfraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis\nfor our opinion.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021.\nShort Hills, New Jersey\nMarch 28, 2024\nF-2\nTable of Contents\nJOURNEY MEDICAL CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 27,439 $ 32,003\nAccounts receivable, net of reserves 15,222 28,208\nInventory 10,206 14,159\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 3,588 3,309\nTotal current assets 56,455 77,679\nIntangible assets, net 20,287 27,197\nOperating lease right-of-use asset, net 101 189\nOther assets 6 95\nTotal assets $ 76,849 $ 105,160\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable $ 18,149 $ 36,570\nDue to related party 195 413\nAccrued expenses 20,350 19,388\nAccrued interest 22 160\nIncome taxes payable 53 35\nLine of credit — 2,948\nDeferred cash payment, net of discount — 4,991\nInstallment payments – licenses, short-term 3,000 2,244\nOperating lease liability, short-term 99 83\nTotal current liabilities 41,868 66,832\nTerm loan, net of discount 14,622 19,826\nInstallment payments – licenses, long-term — 1,412\nOperating lease liability, long-term 9 108\nTotal liabilities 56,499 88,178\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 14)\nStockholders’ equity\nCommon stock, $.0001 par value, 50,000,000 shares authorized, 13,323,952 and 11,765,700 shares issued and outstanding\nas of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively 1 1\nCommon stock -

ORGANIZATION AND PLAN OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS\nJourney Medical Corporation (collectively “Journey” or the “Company”) is a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company that focuses on the development\nand commercialization of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of dermatological conditions. The Company’s current product portfolio includes seven\nbranded and two authorized generic prescription drugs for dermatological conditions that are marketed in the U.S. The Company acquires rights to products\nand product candidates by licensing or otherwise acquiring an ownership interest in, funding the research and development of, and eventually\ncommercializing, the products through its exclusive field sales organization.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company is a majority-owned subsidiary of Fortress Biotech, Inc. (“Fortress” or “Parent”).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had $27.4 million in cash and cash equivalents as compared to $32.0 million at December 31, 2022.\nOn December 27, 2023, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with SWK Funding LLC (“SWK”). The Credit\nAgreement provides for a term loan facility (the “Credit Facility”) in the original principal amount of up to $20.0 million. On the closing date, the Company\ndrew $15.0 million. The remaining $5.0 million may be drawn upon the Company’s request within 12 months after the closing date. Loans under the Credit\nFacility (the “Term Loans”) mature on December 27, 2027, and bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the three-month term Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (“SOFR”) (subject to a SOFR floor of 5%) plus 7.75%. The interest rate resets quarterly. Interest payments begin in February 2024 and are\npaid quarterly. Beginning in February 2026, the Company is required to repay a portion of the outstanding principal of the Term Loans quarterly in an\namount equal to 7.5% of the principal amount of funded Term Loans.\nOn August 31, 2023, the Company entered into a license agreement (the “New License Agreement”) with Maruho Co., Ltd., a Japanese company\nspecializing in dermatology (“Maruho”), whereby the Company granted an exclusive license to Maruho to develop and commercialize Qbrexza® for the\ntreatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Vietnam,\nBrunei, Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos (the “Territory”). Under the terms of the New License Agreement, in exchange for the exclusive rights to Qbrexza ®\nin the Territory, Maruho paid $19.0 million to the Company as a non-refundable upfront payment.\nOn December 30, 2022, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-269079), which was declared effective by the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on January 26, 2023. This shelf registration statement covers the offering, issuance and sale by the Company\nof up to an aggregate of $150.0 million of the Company’s common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, and units (the “2022 Shelf”). In\nconnection with the 2022 Shelf, the Company entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) relating to shares of the\nCompany’s common stock. The Company may offer and sell up to 4,900,000 shares of its common stock, from time to time. During 2023, the Company\nissued 748,703 shares of common stock under the 2022 Shelf, generating net proceeds of $4.5 million. At December 31, 2023, 4,151,297 shares remain\navailable for issuance under the 2022 Shelf.\nThe Company regularly evaluates market conditions, its liquidity profile, and financing alternatives, including out-licensing arrangements for its products to\nenhance its capital structure. The Company may seek to raise capital through debt or equity financings to expand its product portfolio and for other\nstrategic initiatives, which may include sales of securities under either the 2022 Shelf or a new registration statement or drawing on the SWK Credit\nFacility. The Company cannot make any assurances that such additional financing will be available and, if available, the terms may negatively impact the\nCompany’s business and operations. The Company’s current assumptions, projected commercial sales of our products, clinical development plans and\nregulatory submission timelines are uncertain and may not emerge as expected. Additionally, as a result of recurring losses, substantial doubt exists about\nthe Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements.\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of\nliabilities in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the\nF-7\nTable of Contents\nJOURNEY MEDICAL CORPORATION\nNotes to Financial Statements\nrecoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary if the Company is unable to\ncontinue as a going concern.\nNOTE 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (“GAAP”). The Company’s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the accounts of the Company’s wholly-\nowned subsidiary, JG Pharma, Inc. (“JG” or “JG Pharma”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nEmerging Growth Company\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standard-setting bodies and\nadopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will\nnot have a material impact on the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements upon adoption. Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of\n2012, as amended, the Company meets the definition of an emerging growth company and elected the extended transition period for complying with new or\nrevised accounting standards, which delays the adoption of these accounting standards until they would apply to private companies.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts\nof expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates made by management include provisions for coupons, chargebacks, wholesaler fees, specialty\npharmacy discounts, managed care rebates, product returns, and other allowances customary to the pharmaceutical industry. Significant estimates made by\nmanagement also include inventory realization, valuation of intangible assets, useful lives of amortizable intangible assets and share-based compensation.\nActual results may differ materially and adversely from these estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and actual\nresults, the Company’s future results of operations will be affected.\nSegment Information\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete information is available for evaluation by the chief operating\ndecision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company views its operations and\nmanages its business in one segment, which reflects products for the treatment of dermatological conditions.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash. Periodically, the Company\nmay maintain deposits in financial institutions in excess of government insured limits. Management believes that the Company is not exposed to significant\ncredit risk as the Company’s deposits are held at financial institutions that management believes to be of high credit quality. The Company has not\nexperienced any losses on these deposits.\nF-8\nTable of Contents\nJOURNEY MEDICAL CORPORATION\nNotes to Financial Statements\nThe Company’s accounts receivable primarily represent amounts due from drug wholesalers and specialty pharmacies in the United States. The Company\nperforms periodic credit evaluations of customers and does not require collateral. An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for potential credit\nlosses based on the aging of accounts receivable, historical bad debts experience, and the customer’s current ability to pay its obligations to the Company.\nAccounts receivables balances are written off against the allowance when it is probable that the receivable will not be collected. See Note 17 for significant\ncustomers.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents\nat December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted entirely of cash and cash equivalents in institutions within the United States. Balances at certain institutions have\nexceeded Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits.\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nThe Company’s accounts receivable consists of amounts due from customers related to product sales and have standard payment terms. For certain\ncustomers, the accounts receivable for the customer are net of prompt payment or specialty pharmacy discounts. The Company monitors the financial\nperformance and creditworthiness of its customers so that it can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile. The Company reserves\nagainst accounts receivable for estimated losses that may arise from a customer’s inability to pay, and any amounts determined to be uncollectible are\nwritten off against the reserve when it is probable that the receivable will not be collected. The Company has historically not experienced significant credit\nlosses. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.5 million and $0.4 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nInventories\nInventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company periodically reviews\nthe composition of inventory in order to identify excess, obsolete, slow-moving or otherwise non-saleable items taking into account anticipated future sales\ncompared with quantities on hand, and the remaining shelf life of goods on hand. If non-saleable items are observed and there are no alternate uses for the\ninventory, the Company records a write-down to net realizable value in the period that the decline in value is first recognized. The Company’s inventory\nreserves were $0.3 million and $0.4 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nLeases\nArrangements meeting the definition of a lease are classified as operating or financing leases and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as both a\nright-of-use asset and lease liability, calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the lease or the Company’s\nincremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and the right-of-use asset is amortized over the\nlease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right-of-use asset result in straight-line rent expense over the lease\nterm. Variable lease expenses are recorded when incurred.\nIn calculating the right-of-use asset and lease liability, the Company elects to combine lease and non-lease components.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs primarily consist of personnel related expenses, payments made\nto third parties for license and milestone costs related to in-licensed products and technology, and payments made to third party contract research\norganizations.\nContingencies\nThe Company records accruals for contingencies and legal proceedings expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency when it is probable\nthat a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\nF-9\nTable of Contents\nJOURNEY MEDICAL CORPORATION\nNotes to Financial Statements\nIf a loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, the nature of the contingent liability, together with\nan estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material, would be disclosed.\nFair Value Measurement\nThe Company follows accounting guidance on fair value measurements for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Under\nthe accounting guidance, fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in\nan orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined\nbased on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.\nThe accounting guidance requires fair value measurements be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or\nliabilities.\nLevel 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices for similar assets or liabilities that are directly or indirectly observable in the\nmarketplace.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose values are determined\nusing pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of\nfair value requires significant judgment or estimation.\nThe fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair\nvalue. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires management to\nmake judgments and consider factors specific to the asset or liability.\nCertain of the Company’s financial instruments are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but are recorded at amounts that approximate their fair\nvalue due to their liquid or short-term nature, such as accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are reported at cost, less accumulated amortization and impairments. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated\nuseful lives, which represents the estimated life of the product. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method.\nDuring the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into certain licenses and asset purchase agreements. Potential milestone payments for\nachieving sales targets or regulatory development milestones are recorded when it is probable of achievement. Upon a milestone payment being achieved,\nthe milestone payment will be capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life for approved products and expensed for milestones prior to FDA\napproval. Royalty payments are recorded as cost of goods sold as sales are recognized.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in business\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable (a “triggering event”). Factors that the Company considers in\ndeciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of the long-lived asset in relation to expectations, significant\nnegative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. If an impairment review is performed to evaluate\na long-lived asset for recoverability, the Company compares forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition\nof the long-lived asset to its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result\nfrom the use of an asset are less than its carrying amount. The impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying value of the impaired asset over\nits fair value, determined based on discounted cash flows. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an impairment\nF-10\nTable of Contents\nJOURNEY MEDICAL CORPORATION\nNotes to Financial Statements\nloss associated with its intangible asset balance. See Note 5 for further details. The Company did not record any impairment losses on long-lived assets for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022.\nShare-based Compensation\nThe Company has a share-based compensation plan in place and records the associated share-based compensation expense over the requisite service period.\nThe share-based compensation plan and related compensation expense are discussed more fully in Note 16 to the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements.\nCompensation expense for service-based stock options is charged against operations on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally four\nyears. Forfeitures are recorded as they occur. Share-based compensation costs are recorded in both research and development and selling, general and\nadministrative expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Options granted have a term of 10 years from the grant date.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of all service-based stock option awards as of the grant date by applying the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation\nmodel. The application of this valuation model involves assumptions, including the fair value of the common stock, expected volatility, risk-free interest\nrate, expected dividends and the expected term of the option. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent\nmanagement’s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. The following inputs are used in the Black-\nScholes calculation.\nExpected term—The Company has elected to use the “simplified method” for estimating the expected term of options, whereby the expected term equals\nthe arithmetic average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option (generally 10 years).\nExpected volatility— Historical information is the primary basis for the selection of the expected volatility of options granted. However, as the Company\nhas limited trading history for its common shares, the expected volatility was estimated based on the average volatility for comparable guideline publicly\ntraded biotechnology companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants. The comparable companies were chosen based on their\nsimilar size, stage in the life cycle or area of specialty.\nRisk-free interest rate— The risk-free interest rate is selected based upon yields of United States Treasury issues with a term equal to the expected life of the\noption being valued.\nExpected dividend yield—The Company has not issued any dividends in our history and do not expect to issue dividends over the life of the options;\ntherefore, the Company has estimated the dividend yield to be zero.\nRestricted stock units (“RSU’s”) that are service based are recorded as deferred compensation and amortized into compensation expense on a straight-line\nbasis over the vesting period, which ranges from three to four years in duration. Compensation cost for service based RSU’s is based on the grant date fair\nvalue of the award, which is the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date multiplied by the number of shares awarded.\nNet (Loss) Income Per Share\nBasic net (loss) income per share of common stock is calculated by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock\noutstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of\ncommon stock outstanding during the reporting period after giving effect to dilutive potential common shares for stock options and restricted stock units,\ndetermined using the treasury stock method. See Note 19 below.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company records and recognizes revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the\nconsideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s revenues primarily result from contracts\nwith customers, which are generally short-term and have a single performance obligation – the delivery of product. The Company’s performance obligation\nto deliver products is satisfied at the point in time that the goods are received by the customer, which is when the customer obtains title to and has the risks\nand rewards of ownership of the\nF-11\nTable of Contents\nJOURNEY MEDICAL CORPORATION\nNotes to Financial Statements\nproducts. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods to a\ncustomer. The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both.\nMany of the Company’s products sold are subject to a variety of deductions. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for variable consideration, including\ncoupons, chargebacks, wholesaler fees, specialty pharmacy discounts, managed care rebates, product returns, and other deductions customary to the\npharmaceutical industry. Accruals for these provisions are presented in the consolidated financial statements as reductions to gross sales in determining net\nsales and as a contra asset within accounts receivable, net (if settled via credit) and other current liabilities (if paid in cash). Amounts recorded for revenue\ndeductions can result from a series of judgements about future events and uncertainties and can rely on estimates and assumptions. The following section\nbriefly describes the nature of the Company’s provisions for variable consideration and how such provisions are estimated:\nCoupons — The Company offers coupons on products for qualified commercially-insured parties with prescription drug co-payments. Such product sales\nflow through both traditional wholesaler and specialty pharmacy channels. Coupons are processed and redeemed at the time of prescription fulfilment by\nthe pharmacy. The majority of the coupon reserve accrual at the end of the period reflects expected redemptions for product in the distribution channel. The\nexpected accrual reserve requires us to estimate the distribution channel inventory at period end, the expected redemption rates, and the cost per coupon\nclaim that the Company expects to receive. The estimate of product remaining in the distribution channel is comprised of estimated inventory at the\nwholesaler as well as an estimate at the specialty pharmacies, which the Company estimates based upon historical ordering patterns. The estimated\nredemption rate is based on historical redemptions as a percentage of units sold. The cost per coupon is based on the coupon rate.\nChargebacks and Government Chargebacks — The Company sells a portion of its products indirectly through wholesaler distributors to contracted indirect\ncustomers and qualified government healthcare providers. The Company enters into specific agreements with or provides discounts to these indirect\ncustomers and entities to establish pricing for the Company’s products, and in-turn, the indirect customers and entities independently purchase these\nproducts. The Company’s provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by the Company’s wholesale customers to the indirect\ncustomers and estimated wholesaler inventory levels as well as historical chargeback rates. The Company continually monitors its reserve for chargebacks\nand adjusts the reserve accordingly when expected chargebacks differ from actual experience.\nWholesaler fees — The Company provides allowances to its wholesale customers for sales order management, data, and distribution services. The Company\nalso pays administrative and other fees to certain wholesale customers consistent with pharmaceutical industry practices. The Company records a provision\nfor these fees based on contracted rates. Assumptions used to establish the provision include contract sales volumes and average contract pricing. The\nCompany regularly reviews the information related to these estimates and adjusts the provision accordingly.\nSpecialty Pharmacy Discounts — The Company has in place contractual arrangements with specialty pharmacies and provides for contractually agreed\nupon discounts. These discounts are recorded at the time of sale based on the customer’s contracted rate and recorded as a reduction of revenue.\nF-12\nTable of Contents\nJOURNEY MEDICAL CORPORATION\nNotes to Financial Statements\nManaged Care Rebates — The Company is subject to rebates in connection with its agreements with certain contracted commercial payers. The Company\nestimates its managed care rebates based on the Company’s estimated payer mix and the applicable contractual rebate rate. The Company’s accrual for\nmanaged care rebates is based on an estimate of future claims that the Company expects to receive, which considers an estimate for inventory in the\ndistribution channel. The accrual is recognized at the time of sale, resulting in a reduction of gross product revenue.\nProduct Returns — Consistent with industry practice, the Company offers customers a right to return any unused product. The customer’s right of return\ncommences six months prior to product expiration date and ends one year after product expiration date. Products returned for expiration are reimbursed at\ncurrent wholesale acquisition cost or indirect contract price. The Company estimates the amount of its product sales that may be returned by the Company’s\ncustomers and accrues this estimate as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. The Company estimates products\nreturns as a percentage of sales to its customers.\nIncome Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company was 52.01% owned by Fortress Biotech, Inc. (“Fortress”) and was filing consolidated federal tax returns and\nconsolidated or combined state tax returns in multiple jurisdictions with Fortress for tax years prior to 2021. As the Company completed its initial public\noffering on November 12, 2021, it deconsolidated from the Fortress consolidated group for federal income tax purpose. The financial statements recognize\nthe current and deferred income tax consequences that result from the activities during the current and preceding periods, as if the Company were a separate\ntaxpayer rather than a member of the Fortress consolidated income tax return group. Fortress has agreed that the Company does not have to make payments\nto Fortress for the use of net operating losses (“NOLs”) of Fortress (including other Fortress group members). Since Fortress does not require the Company\nto pay in any form for the utilization of the consolidated group’s NOLs, the tax benefit realized have been recorded as a capital contribution.\nThe Company records income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects\nattributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax\nbases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company establishes a valuation allowance if it believes it is more likely than not that the\ndeferred tax assets will not be recovered based on an evaluation of objective verifiable evidence. The Company has considered its history of cumulative tax\nand book income/loss incurred since inception, and the other positive and negative evidence, and has concluded that it is not more likely than not that it will\nrealize the benefits of the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and therefore a full valuation allowance on all of the deferred tax assets\nis required.\nFor tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company recognizes the largest amount of the benefit that is greater than\n50% likely of being realized. For tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company does not recognize any portion\nof the benefit. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits and does not anticipate any significant\nchange to the unrecognized tax benefit balance. The Company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as income tax expense, if\napplicable. There was no interest expense or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits recorded through December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nComprehensive Income\nThe Company has no components of other comprehensive income, and therefore, comprehensive income equals net income.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires\nthat an entity report segment information in accordance with Topic 280, Segment Reporting. The amendment in the ASU is intended to improve reportable\nsegment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments in this update are effective\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently\nevaluating the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which expands disclosures\nin an entity’s income tax rate reconciliation table and disclosures regarding cash taxes paid both in the U.S. and\nF-13\nTable of Contents\nJOURNEY MEDICAL CORPORATION\nNotes to Financial Statements\nforeign jurisdictions. The update will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact\nthat this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nNOTE 3.

ASSET ACQUISITION\nIn January 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with Vyne Therapeutics Inc. (“Vyne”) to acquire two United States Food and Drug\nAdministration (“FDA”) approved topical minocycline products, Amzeeq® (minocycline) topical foam, 4%, and Zilxi® (minocycline) topical foam, 1.5%,\nand a Molecule Stabilizing Technology™ proprietary platform from Vyne for an upfront payment of $20.0 million and an additional $5.0 million payment\non the one year anniversary of the closing (the “Vyne APA”). The Company also acquired the associated inventory related to the products.\nThe Vyne APA also provides for contingent net sales milestone payments, on a product-by-product basis. In the first calendar year in which annual net sales\nreach each of $100 million and $200 million, the Company is required to make a one-time payment of $10.0 million and $20.0 million, respectively, in that\nyear only, per product. In addition, the Company will pay Vyne 10% of any upfront payment received by the Company from a licensee or sublicensee of the\nproducts in any territory outside of the United States, subject to exceptions for certain jurisdictions as detailed in the Vyne APA.\nThe following table summarizes the aggregate consideration transferred for the assets acquired by the Company in connection with the Vyne APA:\nAggregate\nConsideration\n($’s in thousands) Transferred\nConsideration transferred to Vyne at closing $ 20,000\nFair Value of deferred cash payment due January 2023 4,740\nTransaction costs 223\nTotal consideration transferred at closing $ 24,963\nThe fair value of the deferred cash payment was accreted to the $5.0 million January 2023 cash payment over a one-year period through interest expense.\nThe Company made the $5.0 million deferred cash payment in January 2023.\nF-14\nTable of Contents\nJOURNEY MEDICAL CORPORATION\nNotes to Financial Statements\nThe following table summarizes the assets acquired in the Vyne APA:\nAssets\n($’s in thousands) Recognized\nInventory $ 6,041\nIdentifiable intangibles:\nAmzeeq intangible 15,162\nZilxi intangible 3,760\nFair value of net identifiable assets acquired $ 24,963\nThe intangible assets were valued using an income approach, while the inventory was valued using a final sales value less cost to dispose approach.\nNOTE 5. INTANGIBLES\nThe Company’s finite-lived intangible assets consist of acquired intangible assets. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company experienced\nlower net product revenues and gross profit levels for its Ximino products. Based on these results, the Company revised the financial outlook and plans for\nits Ximino products. The Company assessed the revised forecast for Ximino and determined that this constituted a triggering event, and the results of the\nanalysis indicated the carrying amount was not expected to be recovered. The Company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of $3.1 million\nduring the year ended December 31, 2023. This non-cash charge was recorded to loss on impairment of intangible assets in the consolidated statements of\noperations.\nThe table below provides a summary of the Company’s intangible assets at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively:\nEstimated December 31,\n($’s in thousands) Useful Lives (Years) 2023 2022\nIntangible assets - product licenses 3-9 $ 37,925 $ 37,925\nAccumulated amortization (14,495) (10,728)\nAccumulated impairment loss (3,143) —\nTotal intangible assets $ 20,287 $ 27,197\nThe Company’s amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was approximately$ 3.8 million and $4.3 million, respectively.\nAmortization expense is recorded as a component of cost of goods sold in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\nFuture amortization of the Company’s intangible assets is as follows:\nTotal\nFor the years ended Amortization\nDecember 31, 2024 $ 3,257\nDecember 31, 2025 3,257\nDecember 31, 2026 2,471\nDecember 31, 2027 1,775\nThereafter 5,585\nSubtotal 16,345\nAsset not yet placed in service 3,942\nTotal $ 20,287\nF-15\nTable of Contents\nJOURNEY MEDICAL CORPORATION\nNotes to Financial Statements\nNOTE 6. LICENSES ACQUIRED\nDFD-29\nIn June 2021, the Company entered a license, collaboration, and assignment agreement (the “DFD-29 Agreement”) to obtain global rights for the\ndevelopment and commercialization of a late-stage development modified release oral minocycline for the treatment of rosacea (“DFD-29”) with Dr.\nReddy’s Laboratories, Ltd (“DRL”); provided, that DRL retained certain rights to the program in select markets including Brazil, Russia, India and China.\nPursuant to the terms and conditions of the DFD-29 Agreement, the Company paid $10.0 million. Based on the development and commercialization of\nDFD-29, additional contingent regulatory and commercial milestone payments totaling up to $158.0 million may also become payable by the Company.\nThe Company is required to pay royalties ranging from approximately ten percent to fifteen percent on net sales of the DFD-29 product, subject to certain\nreductions. Additionally, the Company was required to fund and oversee the Phase 3 clinical trials beginning upon the license of DFD-29 in 2021. The\nPhase 3 clinical trials substantially concluded in July 2023 upon the Company’s receipt of positive topline results from the trials. From inception to date the\nCompany has incurred approximately $23.8 million in costs associated with the development of DFD-29.\nQbrexza\nIn March 2021, the Company executed an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Qbrexza APA”) with Dermira, Inc., a subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company\n(“Dermira”). Pursuant to the terms of the Qbrexza APA, the Company acquired the rights to Qbrexza® (glycopyrronium), a prescription cloth towelette to\ntreat primary axillary hyperhidrosis in patients nine years of age or older. The Company paid the upfront fee of $12.5 million to Dermira. In addition, the\nCompany is obligated to pay Dermira up to $144.0 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain sales milestones. The royalty structure for the\nagreement is tiered with royalties for the first two years ranging from approximately 40% to 30%.

The interest rate resets quarterly.\nBeginning in February 2026, the Company is required to repay a portion of the outstanding principal of the Term Loans quarterly in an amount equal to\n7.5% of the principal amount of funded Term Loans, with any remaining principal balance due on the maturity date. If the total revenue of the Company,\nmeasured on a trailing twelve-month basis, is greater than $70.0 million as of December 31, 2025, the principal repayment start date is extended from\nFebruary 2026 to February 2027, at which point the Company is required to repay a portion of the outstanding principal of the Term Loans quarterly in an\namount equal to 15% of the principal amount of funded Term Loans, with any remaining principal balance due on the maturity date.\nThe Company may at any time prepay the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loans in whole or in part. Prepayment of the Term Loans is subject to\npayment of a prepayment premium equal to (i) 2% of the Term Loans prepaid plus the amount of interest that would have been due through the first\nanniversary of the Closing Date if the Term Loans are prepaid prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, (ii) 1% of the Term Loans prepaid if the\nTerm Loans are prepaid on or after the first anniversary of the Closing Date but prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date, or (iii) 0% if prepaid\nthereafter.\nUpon repayment in full of the Term Loans, the Company will pay an exit fee equal to 5% of the original principal amount of the Term Loans. Additionally,\nthe Company paid an origination fee of $0.2 million on the Closing Date and incurred issuance costs of $0.2 million, both of which have been recorded as a\ndebt discount. The Company is accreting the carrying value of the SWK Term Loan to the original principal balance plus the exit fee over the term of the\nloan using the effective interest method. The amortization of the discount is accounted for as interest expense. The effective interest rate on the SWK Term\nLoan for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 was 15.1%. The fair value of the debt approximates its carrying value.\nF-19\nTable of Contents\nJOURNEY MEDICAL CORPORATION\nNotes to Financial Statements\nThe SWK Credit Facility also includes both revenue and liquidity covenants, restrictions as to payment of dividends, and is secured by substantially all\nassets of the Company.

Options granted have a term of ten years from the\ngrant date. Options granted generally vest over four-year period. Compensation cost for stock options is charged against operations on a straight-line basis\nover the vesting period. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options on the grant date by applying the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation\nmodel.\nF-21\nTable of Contents\nJOURNEY MEDICAL CORPORATION\nNotes to Financial Statements\nIn 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted, and stockholders approved, the Journey Medical Corporation 2023 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n(the “2023 ESPP”).

At December 31, 2023\napproximately 1,306,923 of RSU’s remained unvested and there was approximately $1.6 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs, which\nthe Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.5 years.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe 2023 ESPP provides that eligible employees may contribute up to 10% of their eligible earnings toward a semi-annual purchase of the Company’s\ncommon stock. The 2023 ESPP is qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The employee’s purchase price is derived from a formula\nbased on the closing price of the common stock on the first day of the offering period versus the closing price on the last date of purchase (or, if not a\ntrading day, on the immediately preceding trading day). The offering period under the 2023 ESPP has a duration of six months, and the purchase price with\nrespect to each offering period beginning on or after such date is, until otherwise amended, equal to 85% of the lesser of (i) the fair market value of the\nCompany’s common stock at the commencement of the applicable six-month offering period or (ii) the fair market value of the Company’s common stock\non the purchase date. The Company estimates the fair value of the common stock under the 2023 ESPP using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair\nvalue was estimated on the date of grant for the offering period beginning August 1, 2023 using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and the straight-\nline attribution approach with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate (5.5%); expected term (0.5 years); expected volatility (129%); and an\nexpected dividend yield (0%). The Company recorded $46,700 of stock-based compensation under the 2023 ESPP for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there was unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $9,524 related to the current ESPP offering period, which ends\nJanuary 31, 2024.\nNOTE 17.

Other\nrevenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 also reflects a net $19.0 million payment from Maruho under the New License Agreement. Other revenue\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022 also reflects a net $2.5 million milestone payment from Maruho. In January 2022, Maruho received manufacturing\nand marketing approval in Japan for Rapifort Wipes 2.5% (Japanese equivalent to U.S. FDA approved Qbrexza®), for the treatment of primary axillary\nhyperhidrosis, triggering the net payment.\nMaruho License Agreement\nOn August 31, 2023, the Company entered into the New License Agreement with Maruho. Under the terms of the New License Agreement, the Company\ngranted an exclusive license to develop and commercialize Qbrexza for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in the Territory. Prior to the date of\nthe New License Agreement, the Company and Maruho were party to an existing exclusive amended and restated license agreement (the “First A&R\nLicense Agreement”), under which Maruho acquired exclusive license rights to Qbrexza in Japan.\nIn connection with Journey’s entry into the New License Agreement, Journey and Maruho also entered into the Second Amended and Restated Exclusive\nLicense Agreement (the “Second A&R License Agreement”), which supersedes the First A&R License Agreement. The Second A&R License Agreement\ncontains modifications that remove Maruho’s obligation to pay Journey royalties on its net sales of Rapifort (the Japanese equivalent of Qbrexza) in Japan\nfor sales occurring after October 1, 2023 and removes Maruho’s obligation to pay $10.0 million to Journey in the event that Maruho achieves net sales of at\nleast ¥4 billion (yen) of Rapifort during a single fiscal year. All other remaining potential milestone payment obligations, which aggregate to $45.0 million,\nremain in full force and effect.\nUnder the terms of the New License Agreement, in exchange for the exclusive rights to Qbrexza in the Territory, Maruho paid the Company a $19.0 million\nnon-refundable upfront payment. Maruho is also obligated to pay royalties to the Company related to sales of the product in the Territory equal to the\ncorresponding rate payable by the Company to Dermira under the asset purchase agreement between Journey and Dermira.\nThe New License Agreement may be terminated by Maruho in its entirety or on a region-by-region basis for convenience upon3 0 days’ notice to the\nCompany.\nF-24\nTable of Contents\nJOURNEY MEDICAL CORPORATION\nNotes to Financial Statements\nThe Company does not have any obligation to assist in the regulatory approval efforts of Maruho under the New License Agreement in the Territory.

Based on the weight of available\nevidence, both positive and negative, the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that it will not realize the benefits of these assets.\nAccordingly, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $20.2 million at December 31, 2023. The valuation allowance increased by $0.8 million\nduring the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of the increase in NOL carryforwards generated in the current period.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had federal and state NOL carryforwards of approximately $15.6 million and $22.7 million, respectively. The\nFederal NOL carryforwards do not expire, but $19.5 million of the state NOL carryforwards expire if not utilized prior to 2042.\nF-26\nTable of Contents\nJOURNEY MEDICAL CORPORATION\nNotes to Financial Statements\nUtilization of the U.S. federal and state NOL carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur\nin the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of NOL carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax\nliabilities, respectively. The Company has performed calculations to support that its NOL carryovers are subject to limitations under section 382 (“382\nLimitations”). Based on the analysis of the NOL carryovers subject to the 382 Limitations, the Company has concluded that the 382 Limitations would not\nprevent the Company from utilizing all of its NOL carryovers prior to expiration.\nThe Company is subject to U.S. federal and state taxes. As of December 31, 2023, the earliest federal tax year open for the assessment of income taxes\nunder the applicable statutes of limitations is its 2020 tax year. The expiration of the statute of limitations related to the various state income and franchise\ntax returns varies by state.\nNOTE 19. NET (LOSS) INCOME PER COMMON SHARE\nThe Company accounts for and discloses net earnings (loss) per share using the treasury stock method. Net earnings (loss) per common share, or basic\nearnings (loss) per share, is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Net earnings (loss)\nper common share assuming dilutions, or diluted earnings (loss) per share, is computed by reflecting the potential dilution from the exercise of in-the-\nmoney stock options, and non-vested restricted stock units.\nThe Company’s basic and diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nBasic and diluted 18,232,422 17,531,274\nPotentially dilutive securities:\nUnvested restricted stock units 1,306,923 2,261,048\nStock options 1,345,193 1,566,131\nTotal potentially dilutive securities 20,884,538 21,358,453\nThe Company’s Common Stock equivalents, including unvested restricted stock and options have been excluded from the computation of diluted loss per\nshare for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, as the effect would be to reduce the loss per share. Therefore, the weighted average Common Stock\noutstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted income loss per share is the same for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nNOTE 20. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nThe Company evaluates events that occur after the period’s end date through the date the financial statements are available to be issued. Accordingly,\nmanagement has evaluated subsequent events through the date these financial statements are issued and has determined that no subsequent events require\ndisclosure in these financial statements.\nF-27\nTable of Contents\nSIGNATURES\nPursuant to the requirements of Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the\nundersigned, thereunto duly authorized.\nJourney Medical Corporation\nBy: /s/ Claude Maraoui\nName: Claude Maraoui\nTitle: President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director\nMarch 28, 2024\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, this report has been signed below by the following persons on behalf of the registrant\nand in the capacities and on the dates indicated.\nSignature Title Date\n/s/ Claude Maraoui President, Chief Executive Officer and Director March 28, 2024\nClaude Maraoui (Principal Executive Officer)\n/s/ Lindsay A.

The aggregate unpaid principal amount so recorded shall be final, binding and conclusive absent manifest error. The\nfailure to so record any such amount or any error in so recording any such amount shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the Obligations of Borrower\nhereunder or under any Note to repay the principal amount of the Loans hereunder, together with all interest accruing thereon.\n2.5.2 Notes.\nAt the request of any Lender, the Loan of such Lender shall be evidenced by a Note, with appropriate insertions, payable to such\nLender in a face principal amount equal to such Lender’s Pro Rata Term Loan Share and payable in such amounts and on such dates as are set forth herein.\n2.6 Payment of Interest.\n2.6.1 Interest Rates.\n(a) The outstanding principal balance under the Loan shall bear interest at a per annum rate of interest equal to the\nContract Rate (as may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with this Section 2.6.1). The Contract Rate applicable to the period beginning on the\nClosing Date through the date that is one (1) day immediately prior to the initial Payment Date shall be calculated based on the Term SOFR Rate as of the\nClosing Date. Whenever, on or subsequent to the initial Payment Date, the Term SOFR Rate is increased or decreased (as determined on the date that is\nten(10) Business Days prior to each Payment Date), the Contract Rate, as set forth herein, shall be similarly changed effective as of such subsequent\nPayment Date, without notice or demand of any kind by an amount equal to the amount of such change in the Term SOFR Rate on the date that is ten (10)\nBusiness Days prior to each such Payment Date. The interest due on the principal balance of the Loan outstanding as of any Payment Date shall be\ncomputed for the actual number of days elapsed during the period in question on the basis of a year consisting of three hundred sixty (360) days and shall be\ncalculated by determining the daily principal balance outstanding for each day of such period in question. The daily rate shall be equal to 1/360th times the\nContract Rate. If any statement furnished by Agent for the amount of a payment due exceeded the actual amount that should have been paid because the\nTerm SOFR Rate decreased and such decrease was not reflected in such statement, Borrower shall make the payment specified in such statement from\nAgent and Borrower shall receive a credit for the overpayment, which credit shall be applied towards the next subsequent payment due hereunder. If any\nstatement furnished by Agent for the amount of a payment due was less than the actual amount that should have been paid because the Term SOFR Rate\nincreased and such increase was not reflected in such statement, Borrower shall make the payment specified in such statement from Agent and Borrower\nshall be required to pay any resulting underpayment with the next subsequent payment due hereunder.\n(b) Borrower recognizes and acknowledges that any default on any payment, or portion thereof, due hereunder or to be\nmade under any of the other Loan Documents, will result in losses and additional expenses to Agent in servicing the Loan, and in losses due to Lenders’ loss\nof the use of funds not timely received. Borrower further acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any such Event of Default, Lenders would be entitled\nto damages for the detriment proximately caused thereby, but that it would be extremely difficult and impracticable to ascertain the extent of or compute\nsuch damages. Therefore, upon\n- 16 -\nthe Term Loan Maturity Date and/or upon the occurrence and during the existence of an Event of Default (or upon any acceleration), interest shall\nautomatically accrue hereunder, without notice to Borrower, at the Default Rate. The Default Rate shall be calculated and due from the date that the Event\nof Default occurred and shall be payable upon demand.\n(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate for any Loan (if applicable), together\nwith all fees, charges and other amounts that are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively, “charges”), shall exceed the maximum\nlawful rate (the “Maximum Rate”) that may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with\napplicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder (if applicable), together with all charges payable in respect of the Loan, shall\nbe limited to the Maximum Rate.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Agent and Borrower shall discuss and agree on the amount of any such adjustment prior to it being given effect\nwith respect to future Revenue-Based Payment Amounts.\n2.9.2 Principal.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan and all other Obligations then due and\nowing shall be Paid in Full on the Termination Date.\n2.10 Payment.\n2.10.1 Making of Payments.\nAll payments of principal, interest, fees and other amounts, shall be made in immediately-available funds, via wire transfer as\ndirected by Agent in writing, not later than 1:00 p.m. Dallas time on the date due, and funds received after that hour shall be deemed to have been received\nby Agent on the following Business Day.

If Agent or a Lender receives a refund or credit (whether or not\npursuant to such claim) of such Taxes, it shall promptly pay over such refund or credit to Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or\nadditional amounts paid, by Loan Parties under this Section 3.1 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund or credit), net of all reasonable out-of-\npocket and documented third-party expenses of the Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental\nAuthority with respect to such refund or credit); provided that Borrower, upon the request of Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay to Agent or such Lender\nthe amount paid over to Borrower in the event Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.

If Agent resigns under this Agreement, Required Lenders shall, with (so long as no Event of Default\nexists) the consent of Borrower (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), appoint from among Lenders a successor agent for Lenders. If no\nsuccessor agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of Agent, Agent may appoint, on behalf of, and after consulting with Lenders and\n(so long as no Event of Default exists) Borrower, a successor agent.

In connection with any enforcement of or foreclosure\nupon its security interests in any of the Assigned Rights, a Permitted Assignee, upon notice to Borrower, SWK and the other Lenders, shall be\nentitled to substitute itself, or its designee, for SWK as a Lender under this Agreement. For purposes hereof, the term “Permitted Assignee” shall\nmean any lender to or funding source of SWK or its Affiliate, together with its successors, assigns or designees (including, without limitation, any\npurchaser or other assignee of the Assigned Rights from such Person). Effective immediately upon the replacement of SWK as a Lender under this\nAgreement by a Permitted Assignee in accordance with this clause (v),\n- 62 -\nSWK shall automatically be deemed to have resigned as Agent pursuant to Section 9.9 of this Agreement (without the need for Agent giving\nadvance written notice of such resignation as required pursuant to such Section 9.9), and Required Lenders shall appoint a successor Agent in\naccordance with Section 9.9 of this Agreement.\n(b) From and after the date on which the conditions described above have been met, (i) such Assignee shall be deemed\nautomatically to have become a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to such Assignee pursuant to such\nAssignment Agreement, shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and (ii) the assigning Lender, to the extent that rights and obligations\nhereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, shall be released from its rights (other than its indemnification rights) and\nobligations hereunder. Upon the request of the Assignee (and, as applicable, the assigning Lender) pursuant to an effective Assignment Agreement,\nBorrower shall execute and deliver to Agent for delivery to the Assignee (and, as applicable, the assigning Lender) a Note in the principal amount of the\nAssignee’s Pro Rata Term Loan Share (and, as applicable, a Note in the principal amount of the Pro Rata Term Loan Share retained by the assigning\nLender). Each such Note shall be dated the effective date of such assignment. Upon receipt by the assigning Lender of such Note, the assigning Lender\nshall return to Borrower any prior Note held by it.\n(c) Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in the United States a\ncopy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of each Lender, and the Commitments of,\nand principal amount of the Loans owing to, such Lender pursuant to the terms hereof.

Such register shall be available for inspection by Borrower and any Lender, at any\nreasonable time upon reasonable prior notice to Agent.\n(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.8.1 or any other provision of this Agreement, any Lender\nmay at any time assign all or any portion of its Loans and its Note (i) as collateral security to a Federal Reserve Bank or, as applicable, to such Lender’s\ntrustee for the benefit of its investors (but no such assignment shall release any Lender from any of its obligations hereunder) and (ii) to (w) an Affiliate of\nsuch Lender which is at least fifty percent (50%) owned (directly or indirectly) by such Lender or by its direct or indirect parent company, (x) its direct or\nindirect parent company, (y) to one or more other Lenders or (z) to an Approved Fund.\n10.9 Participations.\nAny Lender may at any time sell to one or more Persons participating interests in its Loans, Commitments or other interests hereunder\n(any such Person, a “Participant”). In the event of a sale by a Lender of a participating interest to a Participant, (a) such Lender’s obligations hereunder shall\nremain unchanged for all purposes, (b) Borrower and Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s\nrights and obligations hereunder and (c) all amounts payable by Borrower shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation and shall be\npaid directly to such Lender. No Participant shall have any direct or indirect voting rights hereunder except with respect to any event described in Section\n10.1 expressly requiring the unanimous vote of all Lenders or, as applicable, all affected Lenders. Each Lender agrees to incorporate the requirements of the\npreceding sentence into each participation agreement which such Lender enters into with any Participant. Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by\napplicable law, that if amounts outstanding under this Agreement are due and payable (as a result of acceleration or otherwise), each Participant shall be\ndeemed to have the right of set-off in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent as if the amount of its\nparticipating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement; provided that such right of set-off shall be subject to the obligation of each\nParticipant to share with Lenders, and Lenders agree to share with each Participant, as provided in Section 2.10.4. Borrower also agrees that each Participant\nshall\n- 63 -\nbe entitled to the benefits of Section 3 as if it were a Lender (provided that a Participant shall not be entitled to such benefits unless such Participant agrees,\nfor the benefit of Borrower, to comply with the documentation requirements of Section 3.1(c) as if it were a Lender and complies with such requirements,\nand provided, further, that no Participant shall receive any greater compensation pursuant to Section 3 than would have been paid to the participating\nLender if no participation had been sold). Any such Lender transferring a participation shall, as an agent for Borrower, maintain in the United States a\nregister to record the names, address, and interest, principal and other amounts owing to, each Participant. The entries in such register shall be, in the\nabsence of manifest error, conclusive, and Borrower, Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded therein pursuant to the terms\nhereof as a Participant hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. Such participation register shall be available for\ninspection by the Agent or Borrower, at any reasonable time upon reasonable prior written notice from Agent or Borrower.\n10.10 Confidentiality.\nBorrower, Agent and each Lender agree to use commercially reasonable efforts (equivalent to the efforts Borrower, Agent or such Lender\napplies to maintain the confidentiality of its own confidential information) to maintain as confidential all information (including, without limitation, any\ninformation provided by Borrower pursuant to Sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.9) provided to them by any other party hereto and/or any other Loan Party, as\napplicable, except that Agent and each Lender may disclose such information (a) to Persons employed or engaged by Agent or such Lender or any of their\nAffiliates (including collateral managers of Lenders) in evaluating, approving, structuring or administering the Loans and the Commitments (provided that\nsuch Persons have been informed of the covenants contained in this Section 10.10); (b) to any assignee, funding source of Agent or any Lender, or\nparticipant or potential assignee or participant that has agreed to comply with the covenants contained in this Section 10.10 (and any such assignee or\nparticipant or potential assignee or participant may disclose such information to Persons employed or engaged by them as described in clause (a) above);\n(c) as required or requested by any federal or state regulatory authority or examiner, or any insurance industry association, or as reasonably believed by\nAgent or such Lender to be compelled by any court decree, subpoena or legal or administrative order or process; (d) as, on the advice of Agent’s or such\nLender’s counsel, is required by law; (e) in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy under the Loan Documents or in connection with any\nlitigation to which Agent or such Lender is a party; (f) to any nationally recognized rating agency or investor of a Lender that requires access to information\nabout a Lender’s investment portfolio in connection with ratings issued or investment decisions with respect to such Lender; (g) that ceases to be\nconfidential through no fault of Agent or any Lender; (h) to a Person that is an investor or prospective investor in a Securitization that agrees that its access\nto information regarding Borrower and the Loans and Commitments is solely for purposes of evaluating an investment in such Securitization and who\nagrees to treat such information as confidential; or (i) to a Person that is a trustee, collateral manager, servicer, noteholder or secured party in a\nSecuritization in connection with the administration, servicing and reporting on the assets serving as collateral for such Securitization.

In each case described in clauses (c), (d)\nand (e) (as such disclosure in clause (e) pertains to litigation only), where the Agent or Lender, as applicable, is compelled to disclose a Loan Party’s\nconfidential information, promptly after such disclosure the Agent or such Lender, as applicable, shall notify Borrower of such disclosure provided,\nhowever, that neither the Agent nor any Lender shall be required to notify Borrower of any such disclosure (i) to any federal or state banking regulatory\nauthority conducting an examination of the Agent or such Lender, or (ii) to the extent that it is legally prohibited from so notifying Borrower.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Agent reserves the right to provide to industry trade organizations information necessary and customary for inclusion in\nleague table measurements.\n10.11 Captions.\n- 64 -\nCaptions used in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction of this Agreement.\n10.12 Nature of Remedies.\nAll Obligations of Borrower and rights of Agent and Lenders expressed herein or in any other Loan Document shall be in addition to and\nnot in limitation of those provided by applicable law. No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of Agent or any Lender, any right,\nremedy, power or privilege hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege\nhereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.\n10.13 Counterparts; Electronic Signatures.\nThis Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be executed in counterparts with the same effect as if all parties had executed the\nsame document.

This Note evidences the obligation of Borrower to repay, with such interest and fees,\nthe Loans under the Credit Agreement made by Lenders to Borrower pursuant to the Credit Agreement.\nDEFINITIONS\nCapitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement.\nPRINCIPAL AND INTEREST\nPrincipal. Borrower shall make payments on the principal balance of this Note and accrued interest on the principal balance of this Note in\naccordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. If not sooner paid, the entire unpaid principal balance of this Note and all interest thereon shall be\npaid on the Term Loan Maturity Date.\nInterest. Interest on the unpaid balance of this Note will accrue from the date of this Note until final payment thereof in accordance with the\napplicable provisions of the Credit Agreement.\nPrepayments. Borrower may prepay the principal sum outstanding from time to time hereunder as provided in the Credit Agreement, subject to\nany prepayment premium set forth in the Credit Agreement.\nINCORPORATION OF CREDIT AGREEMENT\nThis Note has been issued pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and all of the terms, covenants and conditions of the Credit Agreement (including all\nExhibits and Schedules thereto) and all other instruments evidencing or securing the indebtedness hereunder are hereby made a part of this Note and are\ndeemed incorporated herein in full.\nEVENTS OF DEFAULT\nUpon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Holder shall have the rights and remedies set forth in the Credit\nAgreement and the other Loan Documents, in addition to any other remedies to which the Holder may be entitled.\nLAWFUL LIMITS\nAll agreements between Borrower and Holder are expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of\nadvancement of the proceeds hereof, acceleration of maturity of the unpaid principal balance hereof, or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be\npaid to Holder for the use, forbearance or detention of the money to be advanced hereunder exceed the highest lawful rate permissible under applicable\nusury laws. If, from any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision hereof, of the Credit Agreement or of any other Loan Documents shall\ninvolve transcending the limit of validity prescribed by any law which a court of competent jurisdiction may deem applicable hereto, then, ipso facto, the\nobligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of such validity, and, if from any circumstance Holder shall ever receive as interest an amount which\nwould exceed the highest lawful rate, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the unpaid principal balance due\nhereunder and not to the payment of interest. This provision shall control every other provision of all agreements between Borrower and Holder.\nTo the extent that either Chapter 303 or 306, or both, of the Texas Finance Code, as amended from time to time, apply in determining the\nMaximum Lawful Rate notwithstanding that the parties have chosen the laws of the State of New York (or applicable United States federal law to the extent\nthat it permits Holder to contract for, charge, take, receive or reserve a greater amount of interest than the laws of the State of New York) to govern and\ncontrol in the enforcement, interpretation and construction of the Loan Documents generally, Holder hereby elects to determine the applicable rate ceiling\nby using the weekly ceiling from time to time in effect, subject to Holder’s right from time to time to change such method in accordance with applicable\nlaw, as the same may be amended or modified from time to time, to utilize any other method of establishing the Maximum Lawful Rate under the Texas\nFinance Code or under other applicable law by giving notice, if required, to Borrower as provided by applicable law now or hereafter in effect. To the\nextent United States federal law permits Holder to contract for, charge, take, receive or reserve a greater amount of interest than under Texas law, Holder\nwill rely on United States federal law instead of applicable state law for the purpose of determining the Maximum Lawful Rate. As used herein, (x) the term\n“Maximum Lawful Rate” shall mean the maximum lawful rate of interest which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by Holder in\naccordance with the applicable law (or applicable United States federal law to the extent that it permits Holder to contract for, charge, take, receive or\nreserve a greater amount of interest than under applicable state law), taking into account all Charges made in connection with the transaction evidenced by\nthe Note and the other Loan Documents, and (y) the term “Charges” shall mean all fees, charges and/or any other things of value, if any, contracted for,\ncharged, received, taken or reserved by Holder in connection with the transactions relating to the Loan Agreement, the Note and the other Loan Documents,\nwhich are treated as interest under applicable law.\nMISCELLANEOUS\nWAIVERS.

No delay on the part of Agent or Holder in the exercise of any right, power or remedy hereunder, under the Credit\nAgreement or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by Agent or Holder of any right,\npower or remedy hereunder, under the Credit Agreement or under any other Loan Document preclude other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of\nany other right, power or remedy. Upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, Agent and Holder shall at all times have the right to\nproceed against any portion of the Collateral in such order and in such manner as Agent and Holder may deem fit, subject to and in accordance with the\nCredit Agreement, Guarantee and Collateral Agreement and IP Security Agreement without waiving any rights with respect to any other security.\nInvalid Provisions.

The Administrator is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all\ndeterminations necessary, appropriate or advisable for the administration of this Policy. Any determinations made by the Administrator\nshall be final and binding on all affected individuals and need not be uniform with respect to each individual covered by the Policy. In\nthe administration of this Policy, the Administrator is authorized and directed to consult with the full Board or such other committees\nof the Board, such as the Audit Committee or the Compensation Committee, as may be necessary or appropriate as to matters within\nthe scope of such other committee’s responsibility and authority.\nSubject to any limitation under applicable law, the Administrator may authorize and empower any officer or employee of the Company\nto take any and all actions necessary or appropriate to carry out the purpose and intent of this Policy (other than with respect to any\nrecovery under this Policy involving such officer or employee).\nDefinitions\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following definitions will apply:\n“Accounting Restatement” means an accounting restatement of the Company’s financial statements due to the Company’s material\nnoncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including those that either (a) correct an error in a\npreviously issued financial statement that is material to such previously issued financial statement or (b) correct an error that is not\nmaterial to a previously issued financial statement but would result in a material misstatement if left uncorrected in a current report or\nthe error correction was not recognized in the current period.\n“Administrator” has the meaning set forth in the “Administration” section above.\n“Board” means the Company’s Board of Directors.\n“Clawback Exception” has the meaning ascribed to such term in the “Clawback Exceptions” section below.\n“Covered Officer” means the Company’s officers for purposes of Section 16 under the Exchange Act during any portion of the\nperformance period of the Incentive-Based Compensation.\n“Excess Compensation” means any amount of Incentive-Based Compensation Received by a Covered Officer that exceeds the\namount of Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated\nfinancial information or properly calculated financial measure. Excess Compensation shall be calculated on a pre-tax basis.\n“Incentive-Based Compensation” means any non-equity incentive plan awards, bonuses paid from a bonus pool, cash awards, equity\nor equity-based awards, or proceeds received upon sale of shares acquired through an incentive plan; provided that such compensation\nis granted, earned, and/or vested based wholly or in part on the attainment of a financial performance measure, as determined in\naccordance with Section 10D of the Exchange Act and the Nasdaq Stock Exchange listing standards (the “Clawback Rules”).\nIncentive-Based Compensation does not include any salaries, discretionary bonuses, non-equity incentive plan awards earned upon\nsatisfying a strategic measure or operational measure (e.g., completion of a project), or equity-based awards that are not contingent on\nachieving any financial reporting measure (e.g., time vested stock options, restricted stock or restricted stock units).\n“Look-Back Period” means the three (3) completed fiscal years immediately preceding the earlier of the date on which (a) the Board\nor appropriate committee concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that an Accounting Restatement is required or (b) a\nregulator directs an Accounting Restatement.\n“Received” means any Incentive-Based Compensation that is received during the fiscal year in which the applicable financial\nreporting measure upon which the payment is based is achieved, even if payment or grant of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs\nafter the end of such period.\nClawback Due to Accounting Restatement\nIn the event the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, the Administrator shall require reimbursement or\nforfeiture (“clawback”) of any Excess Compensation Received by any Covered Officer (current or former) during the applicable\nLook-Back Period, regardless of whether the Covered Officer engaged in misconduct or was otherwise directly or indirectly\nresponsible, in whole or in part, for the Accounting Restatement.\nIn the event the Administrator cannot determine the Excess Compensation from the information in the Accounting Restatement or\nfrom the recalculated financial measure, then it will make its determination based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the\nAccounting Restatement or recalculation. Such determination will be final and binding.\nIf a Clawback Exception applies with respect to a Covered Officer, the Company may forgo the recovery described in this Section\nfrom such Covered Officer.\nClawback Method\nThe Administrator may determine, in its sole discretion, the method for the clawback of any amounts due under this Policy, which may\ninclude without limitation direct payment from the Covered\nOfficer, recovery over time, the forfeiture or reduction of future pay or awards, or any other method that will provide for recovery\nwithin a reasonable manner and without undue delay. The Company may enter into deferred payment plans with Covered Officers to\neffectuate clawback to avoid unreasonable economic hardship. Any amounts due under this Policy may be deducted as an offset from\namounts due to the Covered Officer from the Company, except to the extent such set-off is prohibited by law or would violate Section\n409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and the regulations thereunder.\nClawback Exceptions\nThe Company will be required, in the event of an Accounting Restatement, to recover all Excess Compensation received by a Covered\nOfficer during the Look-Back Period unless: (i) one of the following conditions is met; and (ii) the Committee has made a\ndetermination that recovery would be impracticable in accordance with Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act:\n(i) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered (and\nthe Company has already made a reasonable attempt to recover such erroneously awarded Excess Compensation from\nsuch Covered Officer, has documented such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and has provided such documentation to\nthe Nasdaq Stock Exchange);\n(ii) recovery would violate home country laws that existed at the time of adoption of the rule and the Company receives an\nopinion of counsel to that effect; or\n(iii) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to\nemployees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal\nRevenue Code and regulations thereunder. For purposes of clarity, this Clawback Exception only applies to tax-\nqualified retirement plans and does not apply to other plans, including long term disability, life insurance, and\nsupplemental executive retirement plans, or any other compensation that is based on Incentive-Based Compensation in\nsuch plans, such as earnings accrued on notional amounts of Incentive-Based Compensation contributed to such plans.\nGeneral\nThe Company shall not indemnify any Covered Officer against the loss of any covered compensation as a result of the application of\nthis Policy.\nThis Policy is in addition to (and not in lieu of) any right of repayment, forfeiture or right of offset against any employees that is\nrequired pursuant to any statutory repayment requirement (regardless of whether implemented at any time prior to or following the\nadoption or amendment of this Policy), including Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any amounts paid to the Company\npursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 shall be considered in determining any amounts recovered under this\nPolicy.\nThe terms of this Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Officers subject to this Policy and their beneficiaries,\nheirs, executors, or other legal representatives. If any provision of this Policy or the application of such provision to any Covered\nOfficer shall be adjudicated to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not\naffect any other provisions of this Policy, and the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions shall be deemed amended to\nthe minimum extent necessary to render any such provision (or the application of such provision) valid, legal or enforceable.\nEach Covered Officer shall sign and return to the Company, within the later of: (i) 60 calendar days following the Effective Date or (ii)\n30 calendar days following the date the individual becomes a Covered Officer, the Acknowledgement and Agreement Form attached\nhereto as Exhibit A, pursuant to which the Covered Officer agrees to be bound by, and to comply with, the terms and conditions of this\nPolicy.\nTo the extent the Clawback Rules require recovery of Incentive-Based Compensation in additional circumstances beyond those\nspecified above, nothing in this Policy shall be deemed to limit or restrict the right or obligation of the Company to recover Incentive-\nBased Compensation to the fullest extent required by the Clawback Rules.\nThe Board may amend this Policy from time-to-time in its discretion and as necessary to comply with any rules or standards adopted\nby the SEC and the listings standards of any national securities exchange on which the Company’s securities are listed.\nExhibit A\nJourney Medical Corporation (the “Company”)\nClawback Policy\nAcknowledgement and Agreement Form\nI, the undersigned, acknowledge and agree that I have received and reviewed the Clawback Policy of Journey Medical Corporation\n(the “Policy”), effective as of October 1, 2023, as adopted by the Company’s Board of Directors\nFurthermore, I acknowledge and agree:\n· that I am fully bound by, and subject to, all of the terms and conditions of the Policy, as may be amended, restated,\nsupplemented or otherwise modified from time to time.\n· that I have been designated as a “Covered Officer” as defined in the\npolicy.\n· that my execution of this Acknowledgement and Agreement Form is in consideration of, and is a condition to, my continued\nemployment (if currently an employee) and my receipt of future awards from the Company, though nothing in this\nAcknowledgement and Agreement Form shall obligate the Company to make any particular award.\nIn the event of any inconsistency between the Policy and the terms of any employment agreement to which I am a party, or to the terms\nof any compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement under which any incentive-based compensation covered by the Policy is\npayable, the terms of this Policy shall govern and shall be deemed incorporated into all such plans, programs, agreements (including\nany employment agreements) or arrangements, including and without limitation, those granted or awarded prior to the date hereof and\nthose granted or awarded in the future.\nIn the event any Incentive-Based Compensation (as defined in the Policy) is subject to recoupment or recovery under the terms of the\nPolicy, I will promptly take any action necessary to effectuate the recoupment or recovery of such compensation by the Company.\nCOVERED OFFICER\nSignature\nPrint\nName\nDate"
