(the \"Company,” \"Ramaco,” \"we,” \"us” or \"our,”) is a Delaware corporation formed in October 2016. Our\nprincipal corporate and executive offices are located in Lexington, Kentucky with operational offices in Charleston, West Virginia and\nSheridan, Wyoming. We are an operator and developer of high-quality, low-cost metallurgical coal in southern West Virginia and\nsouthwestern Virginia. We also control mineral deposits near Sheridan, Wyoming as part of the Company’s initiatives regarding the potential\nrecovery of rare earth elements and critical minerals as well as the potential commercialization of coal-to-carbon-based products and materials.\nBasis of Presentation—These interim financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of\nthe SEC regarding interim financial reporting. Certain disclosures have been condensed or omitted from these financial statements.\nAccordingly, they do not include all the information and notes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (\"GAAP”) for complete consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial\nstatements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nIn the opinion of the Company, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments,\nconsisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the Company’s financial position as of September 30, 2024,\nas well as the results of operations and cash flows for all periods presented. In preparing the accompanying financial statements, management\nhas made certain estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures\nof contingencies. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of annual\nresults. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities have been eliminated.\nThere were no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements—In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB”) issued Accounting\nStandards Update (\"ASU”) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (\"ASU 2023-\n07”). The amendments in ASU 2023-07 require incremental disclosures related to a public entity’s reportable segments and increase the\nfrequency with which most segment disclosures are made. Incremental disclosures required by the ASU include significant segment expenses\nregularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM”) and included within the segment’s measure of profit or loss, the title and\nposition of the CODM and an explanation how the CODM uses the reported measure of a segment’s profit or loss to assess performance and\nallocate resources, and the amount and composition of other segment items necessary to reconcile segment revenue, significant expenses, and\nthe reported measure of profit or loss. The ASU also expands interim disclosure requirements such that nearly all annual quantitative segment\ndisclosures will be made on an interim basis and requires that entities with a single reportable segment provide all segment disclosures that are\nnot evident from the primary financial statements, including significant segment expenses, consistent with the approach used by management\nto evaluate performance. ASU 2023-07 is effective starting with Ramaco’s 2024 annual financial statements and on a quarterly basis thereafter.\nRetrospective application is required. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU; however, incremental disclosures will likely\noccur upon adoption.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (\"ASU 2023-09”).\nThe amendments in ASU 2023-09 require reporting entities to disclose annual income taxes paid, net of refunds, disaggregated by federal,\nstate, and foreign taxes and to provide additional disaggregated information for individual jurisdictions that equal or exceed 5% of total income\ntaxes paid, net of refunds. ASU 2023-09 also requires public business entities to disclose additional categories of information about federal,\nstate, and foreign income taxes in their annual rate reconciliation table and provide more information about some categories if the\n9\nTable of Contents\nquantitative threshold is met. The ASU will also require disclosure of amounts and percentages in the annual rate reconciliation table, rather\nthan amounts or percentages, and will eliminate certain existing disclosure requirements related to uncertain tax positions and unrecognized\ndeferred tax liabilities. ASU 2023-09 is effective starting with Ramaco’s 2025 annual financial statements and may be applied prospectively to\nonly the income tax disclosures provided for 2025 or retrospectively by providing revised disclosures for all periods presented. Early adoption\nis permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU; however, incremental disclosures will likely be provided on a\nprospective basis in the Company’s 2025 annual financial statements upon adoption.\nIn November 2024, subsequent to the date of the financial statements, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement – Reporting\nComprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (\"ASU\n2024-03”). The amendments in ASU 2024-03 require public business entities to disclose in the notes to the financial statements, among other\nthings, specific information about certain costs and expenses including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, and depreciation,\namortization, and depletion expenses for each caption on the income statement where such expenses are included. ASU 2024-03 is effective\nstarting with the Company’s 2027 annual financial statements and on a quarterly basis thereafter. Early adoption is permitted, and the\namendments may be applied prospectively to reporting periods after the effective date or retrospectively to all periods presented in the\nfinancial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the extent to which its disclosures will be affected by the ASU.\nNOTE 2—INVENTORIES\nInventories consisted of the following:\n(In thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nRaw coal $ 15,196 $ 20,122\nSaleable coal 32,249 12,013\nSupplies 5,606 5,028\nTotal inventories $ 53,051 $ 37,163\nNOTE 3—PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty, plant, and equipment, net consisted of the following:\n(In thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nPlant and equipment $ 323,440 $ 290,060\nMining property and mineral rights 120,532 120,532\nConstruction in process 30,223 13,984\nCapitalized mine development costs 186,843 174,260\nLess: accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization (184,290) (139,745)\nTotal property, plant, and equipment, net $ 476,748 $ 459,091\nOn September 30, 2024, the Company updated its estimates of the amount and timing of future spending related to asset retirement\nobligations. The adjustment resulted in a $1.6 million net increase to capitalized mine development costs above and a corresponding increase\nto the Company’s noncurrent asset retirement obligation liability.\nThe Company received $6.0 million of insurance proceeds during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 related to a methane ignition\nexperienced at our Berwind mining complex in 2022. In 2023, the Company reported the proceeds as other investing activities on the statement\nof cash flows and recognized a $4.9 million gain in other income as the Company had previously accrued a $1.1 million loss recovery asset at\nDecember 31, 2022.\n10\nTable of Contents\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization included:\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nDepreciation of plant and equipment $ 9,519 $ 8,063 $ 27,408 $ 22,492\nAmortization of right of use assets (finance leases) 2,648 2,432 8,025 6,312\nAmortization and depletion of capitalized\nmine development costs and mineral rights 5,644 3,948 13,476 11,046\nTotal depreciation, depletion, and amortization $ 17,811 $ 14,443 $ 48,909 $ 39,850\nThe Company’s closure of its Knox Creek Jawbone mine resulted in an increase in capitalized mine development costs amortization\nexpense of $1.3 million and $1.2 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same\nperiods in 2023. The Jawbone mine was experiencing higher production costs and already nearing end of life.\nNOTE 4—DEBT\nOutstanding debt consisted of the following:\n(In thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nRevolving Credit Facility $ 43,000 $ 42,500\nEquipment loans 524 2,983\nSenior Notes, net 33,646 33,296\nFinancing of Maben Coal acquisition — 11,400\nTotal debt $ 77,170 $ 90,179\nCurrent portion of long-term debt 383 56,534\nLong-term debt, net $ 76,787 $ 33,645\nRevolving Credit Facility—On May 3, 2024, the Company entered into the First Amendment Agreement to the Second Amended and\nRestated Credit and Security Agreement, which includes KeyBank National Association (\"KeyBank”) and multiple lending parties, in order to,\namong other things, extend the maturity date and increase the size of the facility. The amended facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facility”) has a\nmaturity date of May 3, 2029, and provides an initial aggregate revolving commitment of $200.0 million as well as an accordion feature to\nincrease the size by an additional $75.0 million subject to certain terms and conditions, including lenders’ consent. Prior to the First\nAmendment Agreement, the facility had a maturity date of February 15, 2026, and an initial aggregate revolving commitment of $125.0 million\nas well as an accordion feature of $50.0 million.\nThe borrowing base of the amended facility at September 30, 2024 was $100.9 million based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory\ncollateral and reserve requirements. The remaining availability under the Revolving Credit Facility at September 30, 2024, after $43.0 million of\noutstanding borrowings, was $57.9 million.\nRevolving loans under the amended facility bear interest at either the base rate plus 2.0% or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus\n2.5%. The base rate equals the highest of the administrative agent’s prime rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5%, or 3.0%.\nThe terms of the Revolving Credit Facility include covenants limiting the ability of the Company to incur additional indebtedness, make\ninvestments or loans, incur liens, consummate mergers and similar fundamental changes, make restricted payments, and enter into transactions\nwith affiliates. The terms of the facility also require the Company to maintain certain covenants, including fixed charge coverage ratio and\ncompensating balance requirements. A fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.10:1.00, calculated as of the last day of each fiscal\nquarter, must be maintained by the Company. In addition, the Company must maintain an average daily cash balance of $5.0 million, as\ndetermined on a monthly basis, in a dedicated account as well as an additional $1.5 million and $1.0 million in separate dedicated accounts to\nassure future credit availability. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all debt covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.\n11\nTable of Contents\nFair Value—The Company’s Senior Notes had an estimated fair value of approximately $35.9 million and $35.5 million at September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The fair values of the Company’s Senior Notes were based on observable market prices and were\nconsidered a Level 2 measurement based on trading volumes. The difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the Company’s\nremaining debts is not material due to the similarity between the terms of the debt agreements and prevailing market terms available to the\nCompany.\nCurrent Portion of Long-term Debt—The Company’s short-term debt at September 30, 2024 was comprised of $0.4 million due under\nequipment loans. The Company’s short-term debt at December 31, 2023 was comprised of $42.5 million borrowed under the Revolving Credit\nFacility, which was repaid shortly after the December 31, 2023 balance sheet date using funds from current operations, $11.4 million of unpaid\nfinancing associated with the Maben Coal Acquisition, and $2.6 million due under equipment loans.\nOther—Finance lease obligations and liabilities related to insurance premium financing are excluded from the disclosures above.\nNOTE 5—ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES\nAccrued liabilities at September 30, 2024 consisted of accrued compensation of $19.0 million and various other liabilities. Accrued\nliabilities at December 31, 2023 consisted of $14.6 million of accrued compensation and various other liabilities. The year-to-date decrease of\n$3.8 million in Accrued liabilities was largely related to the $5.5 million decrease in cash dividends and short-term dividend equivalents\nliabilities, which was driven by the payment of Class A common stock dividends accrued at year end 2023.\nSelf-Insurance—The Company is self-insured for certain losses relating to workers’ compensation claims and occupational disease\nobligations under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1969, as amended, as well as for employee medical expenses. The Company\npurchases insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to significant levels of these claims. Self-insured losses are accrued based upon\nestimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims incurred as of the balance sheet date using claims data and actuarial assumptions and,\ntherefore, are subject to uncertainty due to a variety of factors.\nThe estimated aggregate liability for these items totaled $5.3 million and $5.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. Of the aggregate liability, the amounts included in Other long-term liabilities were $3.2 million and $3.1 million at September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nFunds held in escrow for potential future workers’ compensation claims are considered restricted cash and have been included in other\ncurrent assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Restricted cash balances were $0.8 million at September 30, 2024 and December\n31, 2023.\nNOTE 6—EQUITY\nCommon Stock—On June 12, 2023, an amendment to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation was approved by\nshareholder vote to reclassify the Company’s existing common stock as shares of Class A common stock and create a separate Class B\ncommon stock.\nThe initial distribution of Class B common stock occurred on June 21, 2023 via a stock dividend to existing holders of common stock as of\nMay 12, 2023. On the date of initial distribution, each holder of common stock received 0.2 shares of Class B common stock for every one\nshare of existing common stock held on the record date. Similar actions or modifications occurred for holders of outstanding stock-based\nawards.\nThe distribution of the Class B common stock provides existing holders of the Company’s common stock with an opportunity to\nparticipate directly in the financial performance of the Company’s CORE assets on a stand-alone basis, separate from the Company’s\nmetallurgical coal operations. CORE assets were acquired initially as part of the Company’s acquisition of Ramaco Coal in the second quarter\nof 2022. The financial performance of CORE assets consists of the following non-cost bearing revenue streams based on the Company’s\ncurrent expectations:\n12\nTable of Contents\n● Royalty fees derived from the royalties associated with the Ramaco Coal and Amonate reserves, which we believe approximates 3%\nof Company-produced coal sales revenue excluding coal sales revenue from Knox Creek,\n● Infrastructure fees based on $5.00 per ton of coal processed at our preparation plants and $2.50 per ton of loaded coal at the\nCompany’s rail load-out facilities, and\n● Future income derived, if and when realized, from advanced carbon products as well as rare earth elements and critical minerals\ninitiatives.\nThe Company has paid dividends equal to 20% of the total fees above; however, any dividend amounts declared and paid are subject to\nthe sole discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors.\nIn addition, the Board of Directors retains the power to change or add expense allocation policies related to CORE, redefine CORE assets,\nand redetermine CORE’s per-ton usage fees at any time, in its sole discretion, without shareholder approval. Holders of shares of Class A\ncommon stock continue to be entitled to receive dividends when and if declared by the Board of Directors subject to any statutory or\ncontractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and to any prior rights and preferences that may be applicable to outstanding preferred\nstock, if any.\nCORE is not a separate legal entity, and holders of Class B common stock do not own a direct interest in the assets of CORE. Holders of\nClass B common stock are stockholders of Ramaco Resources, Inc. and are subject to all risks and liabilities of the Company as a whole.\nWith respect to voting rights, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters\nsubmitted to a vote of the stockholders and are entitled to one vote per share. The holders of Class A common stock and Class B common\nstock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. Class B common stock does not have any specific voting rights or\ngovernance rights with respect to CORE.\nWith respect to liquidation rights, holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably the assets available for distribution to the\nstockholders after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preference of outstanding preferred stock, if any. That is, the rights to residual net\nassets upon liquidation are equal between holders of Class A and Class B common stock. Holders of Class B common stock do not have\nspecific rights to CORE assets in the event of liquidation.\nThe Board of Directors also retains the ability, in its sole discretion, to exchange all outstanding shares of Class B common stock into\nClass A common stock based on an exchange ratio determined by a 20-day trailing volume-weighted average price for each class of stock.\nThe initial distribution of the tracking stock was recorded as a stock dividend at fair value, which was estimated to be $11.00 per share\nbased on the closing price of Class B shares on the first day of regular-way trading. The effect of the equity restructuring was a $102.9 million\nreduction in retained earnings and an increase of $102.9 million to Class B common stock and additional paid-in capital during the second\nquarter of 2023. Outstanding stock-based awards were reclassified to Class A common stock as part of the equity restructuring. In addition,\npursuant to the terms of the Company’s outstanding stock-based awards, equitable adjustments were made in accordance with such terms\nbased on the same factor of 0.2 for every outstanding award. Since there were no changes in fair value, vesting conditions, or award\nclassification, no incremental compensation expense resulted.\nStock-Based Awards—Stock-based compensation expense totaled $4.0 million and $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense totaled $13.3 million and $9.7 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. During 2024, the Company granted new stock-based awards and modified certain\nawards previously granted as discussed below. New stock-based awards granted during the first nine months of 2024 were for Class A\ncommon stock, all of which were granted in the first quarter of 2024. There were no Class B stock-based awards granted during the first nine\nmonths of 2024.\nRestricted Stock—We granted 179,028 shares of Class A restricted stock to certain senior executives, key employees, and directors\nduring the first quarter of 2024, having a grant-date fair value of $3.1 million. The aggregate\n13\nTable of Contents\nfair value of the awards granted to employees was $2.5 million, which is recognized ratably as expense over the three-year service period\nunless forfeited. The aggregate fair value of restricted stock granted to directors was $0.6 million, which is recognized ratably as expense over\none year unless forfeited. During the vesting period, the participants have voting rights and receive nonforfeitable dividends on the same\nbasis as fully vested common stockholders.\nRestricted Stock Units (\"RSUs”)—We granted 302,699 Class A restricted stock units to certain senior executives and key employees\nduring the first quarter of 2024, having a grant-date fair value of $17.58 per share. The aggregate fair value of these awards was $5.3 million,\nwhich is recognized ratably as expense over the three-year service period unless forfeited. During the vesting period, the participants have no\nvoting rights and no dividend rights; however, participants are entitled to receive dividend equivalents, which shall be subject to the same\nconditions applicable to the units and payable at the time the units vest. The recipient will receive one share of Class A common stock for\neach stock unit vested.\nPerformance Stock Units (\"PSUs”)—We granted Class A performance stock units to certain senior executives and key employees\nduring the first quarter of 2024. These awards cliff-vest approximately three years from the date of grant based on the achievement of targeted\nperformance levels related to pre-established relative total shareholder return goals. These performance stock units may be earned from 0% to\n200% of target depending on actual results. During the vesting period, the participants have no voting rights and no dividend rights;\nhowever, participants are entitled to receive dividend equivalents, which shall be subject to the same conditions applicable to the units and\npayable at the time the units vest. The recipient will receive one share of Class A common stock for each stock unit vested.\nPerformance stock units are accounted for as awards with a market condition since vesting depends on total shareholder return\nrelative to a group of peer companies. The target number of performance stock units granted during the first quarter of 2024, or 315,941 units,\nwere valued relative to the total shareholder return of a peer group based on a Monte Carlo simulation, which resulted in a grant date fair value\nof $28.72 per unit. The aggregate fair value of these awards was $9.1 million, which is recognized ratably as expense over the three-year period.\nModification— The resignation of one of the Company’s executive officers and the separation agreement between the employee and\nthe Company that occurred during the first quarter of 2024 resulted in a net charge to stock compensation expense of $1.2 million during the\nperiod. Incremental value of $1.8 million resulted from the continued equity vesting provision included in the separation agreement applicable\nto the employee’s restricted stock awards, which was recognized as expense. This amount was offset partially by the $0.6 million reversal of\npreviously recognized compensation expense related to the pre-modified restricted stock award ($0.3 million) as well as the forfeiture of\nrestricted stock units and performance stock units (collectively $0.3 million).\nDividends–On December 6, 2023, the Company announced that the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on Class A common\nstock of $0.1375 per share of Class A common stock, which was paid on March 15, 2024 to shareholders of record on March 1, 2024 in the\namount of $6.1 million. Dividends of $6.0 million were accrued in December 2023 for the declaration of the Class A cash dividends. In addition,\npreviously accrued dividend equivalents of $0.1 million were paid to employees who satisfied restricted stock unit service conditions during\nthe first quarter of 2024. On February 1, 2024, the Company announced that the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.2416 per\nshare of Class B common stock, which was paid on March 15, 2024 to shareholders of record on March 1, 2024 in the amount of $2.1 million.\nOn May 8, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $0.1375 per share of Class A common\nstock and $0.2376 per share of Class B common stock, which were paid on June 15, 2024 to shareholders of record on June 1, 2024, in the\namount of $6.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively. On August 7, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared cash\ndividends of $0.1375 per share of Class A common stock and $0.2246 per share of Class B common stock, which were paid on September 13,\n2024 to shareholders of record on August 30, 2024, in the amount of $6.0 and $2.0 million, respectively, bringing the total cash dividends paid\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to $24.5 million. The Company also accrued $0.7 million of forfeitable dividend equivalents\nduring 2024.\n14\nTable of Contents\nOn December 8, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of approximately $0.125 per\nshare of common stock. Estimated dividends of $5.5 million were accrued in December 2022 and were paid on March 15, 2023 to shareholders\nof record on March 1, 2023 in the amount of $5.6 million.\nCash dividends in the amount of $5.6 million, or approximately $0.125 per share of common stock, were paid on June 15, 2023, to\nshareholders of record on June 1, 2023. In addition, cash dividends of $0.125 per share of Class A common stock and $0.165 per share of Class\nB common stock were paid on September 15, 2023 to shareholders of record on September 1, 2023, in the amount of $5.5 million and $1.5\nmillion, respectively, bringing the total cash dividends paid for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $18.0 million.\nNOTE 7—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nEnvironmental Liabilities—Environmental liabilities are recognized when the expenditures are considered probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. Measurement of liabilities is based on currently enacted laws and regulations, existing technology, and undiscounted\nsite-specific costs. Generally, such recognition would coincide with a commitment to a formal plan of action. No amounts have been\nrecognized for environmental liabilities.\nSurety Bond—In accordance with state laws, we are required to post reclamation bonds to assure that reclamation work is completed. We\nalso have a smaller amount of surety bonds that secure performance obligations. Bonds outstanding at September 30, 2024 totaled\napproximately $31.2 million.\nCoal Leases and Associated Royalty Commitments—We lease coal reserves under agreements that require royalties to be paid as the\ncoal is mined and sold. Many of these agreements require minimum annual royalties to be paid regardless of the amount of coal mined and\nsold. Total royalty expenses were $6.4 million and $9.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and\n$19.5 million and $25.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. These agreements generally\nhave terms running through exhaustion of all the mineable and merchantable coal covered by the respective lease. Royalties or throughput\npayments are based on a percentage of the gross selling price received for the coal we mine.\nContingent Transportation Purchase Commitments—We secure the ability to transport coal through rail contracts and export terminals\nthat are sometimes funded through take-or-pay arrangements. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s remaining commitments under take-\nor-pay arrangements totaled $19.6 million, the majority of which relates to a multi-year contract with a total remaining commitment of $17.5\nmillion until the term expires in the first quarter of 2028. The level of these commitments will generally be reduced at a per ton rate as such rail\nand export terminal services are utilized against the required minimum tonnage amounts over the contract term stipulated in such rail and\nexport terminal contracts. However, as of September 30, 2024, the Company has an accrued liability of $0.2 million related to volume shortfall.\nThe accrued liability for the expected shortfall was $0.8 million at December 31, 2023.\nLitigation—From time to time, we are subject to various litigation and other claims in the normal course of business. Losses related to\nsuch contingencies are accrued when/if loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. No losses have been accrued in the\nconsolidated financial statements with respect to such matters. Losses from certain injury-related matters are reasonably possible of\noccurring; however, an estimate of the possible range of loss cannot be made at this time as such litigation has not yet progressed sufficiently\nthrough discovery and development of important facts and legal issues.\nOn November 5, 2018, one of our three raw coal storage silos that fed our Elk Creek plant experienced a partial structural failure. A\ntemporary conveying system completed in late-November 2018 restored approximately 80% of our plant capacity. We completed a permanent\nbelt workaround and restored the preparation plant to its full processing capacity in mid-2019. Our insurance carrier, Federal Insurance\nCompany, disputed our claim for coverage based on certain exclusions to the applicable policy and, therefore, on August 21, 2019, we filed\nsuit against Federal Insurance Company and Chubb INA Holdings, Inc. in Logan County Circuit Court in West Virginia seeking a declaratory\njudgment that the partial silo collapse was an insurable event and to require coverage under our policy. Defendants removed the case to the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, and upon removal, we\n15\nTable of Contents\nsubstituted ACE American Insurance Company as a defendant in place of Chubb INA Holdings, Inc. The trial in the matter commenced on\nJune 29, 2021, in Charleston, West Virginia.\nOn July 15, 2021, the jury returned a verdict in our favor for $7.7 million in contract damages and on July 16, 2021, made an additional\naward of $25.0 million for damages for wrongful denial of the claim under Hayseeds, Inc. v. State Farm Fire & Cas., 177 W. Va. 323, 352 S.E. 2d\n73 (W. Va. 1986), including inconvenience and aggravation. On August 12, 2021, the defendants filed a post-trial motion for judgment as a\nmatter of law or in the alternative to alter or amend the judgment or for a new trial. On March 4, 2022, the court entered its memorandum\nopinion and order on the motion reducing the jury award to a total of $1.8 million, including pre-judgment interest, and also vacated and set\naside, in its entirety, the jury award of Hayseeds damages. The same day, the court entered the judgment in accordance with the memorandum\nopinion and order.\nOn April 1, 2022, we filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. On July 20, 2023, the court rendered a\ndecision reinstating the jury’s $7.7 million contract damages verdict. The court further determined that we are entitled to attorney’s fees in an\namount to be determined on remand. Finally, the court held that we are entitled to Hayseeds damages for wrongful denial of the claim but\nremanded for a new trial on the amount of such damages after affirming that the original $25 million award was excessive. On August 3, 2023,\nthe Defendants-Appellees filed a Petition of Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc with the Fourth Circuit. The petition was denied by order dated\nAugust 15, 2023. On August 29, 2023, the court clarified that the amount of attorney’s fees to be determined on remand included appellate\nfees. On September 8, 2023, the court entered its amended judgment, which awarded post-judgment interest on the previously awarded and\nreinstated verdict related to contract (compensatory) damages and the Fourth Circuit thereafter issued its mandate on October 2, 2023. The\nmatter is now pending before the District Court for a new trial for Hayseeds damages, as well as the court’s determination and award of\nattorney’s fees. On August 19, 2024, the Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order that the Hayseeds damages to be considered in the\nnew trial would include annoyance and inconvenience up to October 2, 2023 with new discovery permitted for the time period of July 15, 2021\nthrough October 2, 2023. The Court also ordered Hayseeds damages to be considered for net economic loss caused by the defendant’s delay\nin settlement be allowed for the time period of July 15, 2021 through October 2, 2023 with new discovery to be permitted for that time period.\nThe defendants fully paid during 2023 the contract damages and interest portion of the judgment related to contract (compensatory)\ndamages in the court’s order and that portion of the matter is considered closed. On April 24, 2024, the Court stated Ramaco is entitled to\nreasonable attorney fees for both the appeal and the first trial, adding there will be a full Hayseeds trial under the timelines set forth above.\nRegarding the court’s determination and award of attorney’s fees, the Company accrued a loss recovery asset of approximately $3.1 million\nduring the second quarter of 2024. The Company considers that it is probable to recover at least this amount of previously recognized\nattorneys’ fees expenses based on the developments above.\nNOTE 8—REVENUE\nOur revenue is derived from contracts for the sale of coal and is recognized when the performance obligations under the contract are\nsatisfied, which is at the point in time control is transferred to our customer. Generally, domestic sales contracts have terms of about one year\nand the pricing is typically fixed. Export sales have spot or term contracts, and pricing can be either fixed or derived against index-based\npricing mechanisms. Sales completed with delivery to an export terminal are reported as export revenue.\nDisaggregated information about Revenue is presented below:\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCoal Sales\nNorth American revenue $ 54,073 $ 75,143 $ 163,588 $ 168,571\nExport revenue, excluding Canada 113,338 111,823 331,815 322,224\nTotal revenue $ 167,411 $ 186,966 $ 495,403 $ 490,795\n16\nTable of Contents\nRevenue for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes a $0.4 million net decrease to revenue and a $1.3 million\nnet increase to revenue, respectively, related to adjustments for performance obligations satisfied in a previous reporting period. These\nadjustments were due to true-ups of previous estimates for provisional pricing and demurrage as well as price adjustments for minimum\nspecifications or qualities of delivered coal.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding performance obligations of approximately 1.7 million tons for contracts with fixed\nsales prices averaging $151 per ton, excluding freight, as well as 1.6 million tons for contracts with index-based pricing mechanisms. The\nCompany expects to satisfy approximately 36% of the committed tons in the fourth quarter of 2024, 63% in 2025, and 1% in 2026. Variable\namounts, including index-based prices, have not been estimated for the purpose of disclosing remaining performance obligations as permitted\nunder the revenue recognition guidance when variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation.\nConcentrations—During the three months ended September 30, 2024, sales to two individual customers were 10% or more of our total\nrevenue. Sales to these customers represented 12% and 10% of our total revenue during the three-month period. During the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, sales to two individual customers were 10% or more of our total revenue. Sales to these customers represented 13%\nand 10% of our total revenue during the nine-month period. For comparison purposes, during the three months ended September 30, 2023,\nsales to three individual customers were 10% or more of our total revenue and accounted for approximately 52%, collectively, of our total\nrevenue. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, sales to four individual customers were 10% or more of our total revenue and\naccounted for approximately 55%, collectively, of our total revenue. Four customers with individual accounts receivable balances equal to 10%\nor more of total accounts receivable made up approximately 17%, 17%, 15%, and 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable balance as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nNOTE 9—INCOME TAXES\nIncome tax provisions for interim periods are generally based on an estimated annual effective income tax rate calculated separately from\nthe effect of significant, infrequent, or unusual items related specifically to interim periods. The income tax impacts of discrete items are\nrecognized in the period these occur.\nOur effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 9.3% and 22.0%, respectively, excluding\nthe impact of discrete items. Our effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, excluding discrete\nitems, was 28.0% and 20.5%, respectively. Discrete items of $1.0 million were recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nrelated to excess tax benefits on share-based awards. The primary differences from the federal statutory rate of 21% are related to state taxes,\nnon-deductible expenses, the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, and depletion expense for income tax purposes.\nNOTE 10—EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\nEarnings per share (\"EPS”) is not presented retrospectively for periods prior to the issuance of the tracking stock as the tracking stock\nwas not a part of the Company’s capital structure during those periods and the issuance of the tracking stock changes the common\nshareholders’ relative residual interest in the Company. Therefore, EPS is presented for the Company’s single class of common stock up to the\ntime the tracking stock was issued and, subsequent to this date, EPS is presented prospectively under the two-class method.\nThe computation of basic and diluted EPS is shown on the following page:\n17\nTable of Contents\n(In thousands, except per share amounts) Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nEarnings (loss) attribution\nSingle class of common stock (through 6/20/2023) * $ N/A $ N/A $ N/A $ 31,382\nClass A common stock (1,245) 17,288 2,085 18,616\nClass A restricted stock awards 52 721 282 824\nClass B common stock 507 1,395 4,079 1,395\nClass B restricted stock awards 9 58 152 58\nForfeitable dividends declared on unvested stock-based awards 438 — 736 —\nNet income (loss) $ (239) $ 19,462 $ 7,334 $ 52,275\n* Common stock and restricted stock participated in earnings 1:1\nand are shown on a combined basis through 6/20/2023 consistent\nwith historical presentation\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 Nine months ended September 30, 2024\nClass A Class B Class A Class B\n2024 EPS calculations\nNumerator\nNet earnings (loss) $ (1,245) $ 507 $ 2,085 $ 4,079\nDenominator\nWeighted average shares used to compute basic earnings per\nshare 43,378 8,684 42,827 8,574\nDilutive effect of stock option awards — 85 172 91\nDilutive effect of restricted stock units — 35 64 31\nDilutive effect of performance stock units — 166 283 159\nWeighted average shares used to compute diluted earnings per\nshare 43,378 8,970 43,346 8,855\nEarnings (loss) per common share (dual-class structure)\nBasic $ (0.03) $ 0.06 $ 0.05 $ 0.48\nDiluted $ (0.03) $ 0.06 $ 0.05 $ 0.46\nThree months ended September 30, 2023 June 21 - September 30, 2023 Jan. 1 - June 20, 2023\nClass A Class B Class A Class B YTD 2023 Single Class\n2023 EPS calculations (single class of common stock\nthrough 6/20/2023)\nNumerator\nNet earnings $ 17,288 $ 1,395 $ 18,616 $ 1,395$ 31,382\nDenominator\nWeighted average shares used to compute basic earnings per\nshare 42,144 8,432 42,044 8,412 44,344\nDilutive effect of stock option awards 352 103 339 97 381\nDilutive effect of restricted stock units 85 49 62 41 —\nDilutive effect of performance stock units 302 102 263 92 27\nWeighted average shares used to compute diluted earnings per\nshare 42,883 8,686 42,708 8,642 44,752\nEarnings per common share (single class of common stock)\nBasic $ 0.41 $ 0.17 $ 0.44 $ 0.17$ 0.71\nDiluted $ 0.40 $ 0.16 $ 0.44 $ 0.16$ 0.70\n18\nTable of Contents\nUnvested restricted stock awards have the right to receive nonforfeitable dividends on the same basis as common shares; therefore,\nunvested restricted stock is considered a participating security for the purpose of calculating EPS. Prior to the initial distribution of Class B\ncommon stock in the second quarter of 2023, the Company showed EPS for its common stock and unvested restricted stock on a combined\nbasis since both instruments participate on the same basis and the resulting EPS is typically the same. Starting under the two-class method,\nthe Company reports separately the net earnings allocated away from holders of Class A and Class B common stock to holders of unvested\nrestricted stock awards.\nFor accounting purposes, Class B’s participation rights in net earnings are, in substance, discretionary based on the power of the\nCompany’s Board of Directors to add or modify expense allocation policies, redefine CORE assets, and redetermine CORE’s per-ton usage fees\nat any time, in its sole discretion, without shareholder approval. Therefore, no amount of the Company’s net earnings shall be allocated to\nClass B for the purpose of calculating EPS other than actual dividends declared during the period for the tracking stock. However, during the\nthree months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, dividends declared by the Company were in excess of consolidated net income\n(loss) for the period, which resulted in an undistributed net loss for reporting purposes. The resulting undistributed net loss was allocated\nproportionately between outstanding Class A and Class B common stock based on the rights to residual net assets upon liquidation being\nequal between holders of Class A and Class B common stock. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, three dividends were declared\nfor Class B common stock while only two dividends were declared for Class A common stock due to the timing of declaration.\nDiluted EPS is calculated using the treasury stock method for stock options and restricted stock units. For performance stock units, the\nawards are first evaluated under the contingently issuable shares guidance, which requires a determination as to whether shares would be\nissuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period. For shares determined to be issuable under performance\nstock unit awards, the treasury stock method is then applied to determine the dilutive impact of the awards, if any. Unvested restricted stock\nawards are considered potential common shares as well as participating securities, as discussed previously, and are included in diluted EPS\nusing the more dilutive of the treasury stock method or the two-class method. Since these awards share in dividends on a 1:1 basis with\ncommon shares, applying the treasury stock method is antidilutive compared to the basic EPS calculation that allocates earnings to\nparticipating securities under the two-class method discussed previously.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, diluted EPS for Class A Common stock excluded all outstanding awards of potential\ncommon stock because of the allocated net loss discussed above, and, therefore, the inclusion of any potential common shares would be\nantidilutive. Excluded Class A common stock awards were 649 thousand options to purchase Class A common stock, 718 thousand RSUs, and\n1,057 thousand PSUs (at target). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, diluted EPS for Class A common stock excluded only the\nRSUs and PSUs granted in the first quarter of 2024, as discussed in Note 6, because the effect would have been antidilutive under the treasury\nstock method or, in the third quarter, because of the evaluation of such PSUs under the guidance for contingently issuable shares. No\npotential common shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS for Class B common stock.\nFor the third quarter of 2023 and the period from June 21,2023 through September 30, 2023, diluted EPS for Class A common stock\nexcluded 166 thousand RSUs because the effect would have been antidilutive under the treasury stock method. Class A diluted EPS for these\nperiods also excluded outstanding PSUs originally granted in 2022, or approximately 153 thousand units if September 30, 2023 were the end of\nthe contingency period, because the effect would have been antidilutive under the treasury stock method. The same PSUs, or 249 thousand\nunits at target, were excluded in the second quarter of 2023 based on the guidance for contingently issuable shares.\nFor the third quarter of 2023 and the period from June 21, 2023 through September 30, 2023, diluted EPS for Class B common stock\nexcluded certain PSUs, or approximately 31 thousand units if September 30, 2023 were the end of the contingency period, because the effect\nwould have been antidilutive under the treasury stock method. The same awards, or 50 thousand units at target, were excluded in the second\nquarter of 2023 based on the guidance for contingently issuable shares.\nDiluted EPS for the single class of common stock existing from January 1, 2023 through June 20, 2023, excluded all outstanding RSUs, or\n684 thousand units in total, because the effect would have been antidilutive under the treasury\n19\nTable of Contents\nstock method. In addition, diluted EPS for the single class of common stock during this period excluded outstanding PSUs originally granted\nin 2022, or 249 thousand units at target, based on the guidance for contingently issuable shares.\nNOTE 11—RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nRamaco Coal Deferred Purchase Price—A portion of the financing of the 2022 acquisition of Ramaco Coal was provided by Yorktown\nPartners, a related party. The Company incurred interest expense of $0.4 million and $1.7 million for the three months and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively, related to the financing. The Company repaid the related-party financing debt in full during the fourth quarter\nof 2023. No further amounts are owed to Yorktown Partners related to this matter.\nOther Professional Services—The Company has also entered into professional services agreements with five other related parties, which\nhave been aggregated due to immateriality. Professional service fees for these related party transactions totaled approximately $0.2 million\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nNOTE 12—SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nSubsequent to the date of the financial statements, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, which was discussed earlier in Note 1.\n* * * * *\n20\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the\n\"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in our Annual Report, as well as the\nfinancial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking\nstatements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. The forward-looking statements are dependent upon\nevents, risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control. We caution you that our actual results could differ materially from those\ndiscussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are discussed elsewhere in this\nQuarterly Report, particularly in the \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and in our Annual Report and in this\nQuarterly Report under the heading \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,” all of which are difficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and\nassumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-\nlooking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law.\nOverview\nWe are an operator and developer of high-quality, low-cost metallurgical coal in southern West Virginia and southwestern Virginia. Our\ndevelopment portfolio primarily includes the following properties: Elk Creek, Berwind, Knox Creek, and Maben. We believe each of these\nproperties possesses geologic and logistical advantages that make our coal among the lowest delivered-cost U.S. metallurgical coal to our\ndomestic customer base, North American blast furnace steel mills and coke plants, as well as international metallurgical coal consumers. We\nalso control mineral deposits near Sheridan, Wyoming as part of the Company’s initiatives regarding the potential recovery of rare earth\nelements and critical minerals as well as the potential commercialization of coal-to-carbon-based products and materials.\nOur primary source of revenue is the sale of metallurgical coal. We are a pure-play metallurgical coal company with 59 million reserve tons\nand 1,119 million measured and indicated resource tons of high-quality metallurgical coal. Our plan is to continue development of our existing\nproperties and grow annual production over the next few years to approximately seven million clean tons of metallurgical coal, subject to\nmarket conditions, permitting and additional capital deployment in the medium-term. We may make acquisitions of reserves or infrastructure\nthat continue our focus on advantaged geology and lower costs.\nThe overall outlook of the metallurgical coal business is dependent on a variety of factors such as pricing, regulatory uncertainties, and\nglobal economic conditions. Coal consumption and production in the U.S. is driven by several market dynamics and trends including the U.S.\nand global economies, the U.S. dollar’s strength relative to other currencies and accelerating production cuts. In addition, blast furnace\nsteelmaking is more prevalent outside the U.S. compared to domestic steel production, which creates demand for exports of metallurgical coal.\nGlobal metallurgical coal markets have softened in 2024 due to constrained economic growth in some regions of the world and continued\nconflict overseas. The global steel market has experienced slower growth, especially in China, resulting in elevated levels of Chinese steel\nexports. These conditions have led steel companies to both cut back on their own production and to reduce the price they are willing to pay\nfor their metallurgical coal feedstock. Longer term, the Company believes that limited global investment in new coking coal production\ncapacity and an eventual return to economic growth will support coking coal markets overall.\nDuring the first nine months of 2024, we sold 2.9 million tons of coal and recognized $495.4 million of revenue. Of this amount, 33% of our\nrevenue was from sales into North American markets, including Canada, and 67% of our revenue was from sales into export markets. During\nthe same period of 2023, we sold 2.5 million tons of coal and recognized $490.8 million of revenue, of which 34% was from sales into North\nAmerican markets, including Canada, and 66% was from sales into export markets. Sales into export markets, which often include index-based\npricing, generally have greater exposure to variability in pricing from period to period. The Company’s exports have not been materially\ndelayed or otherwise affected by recent severe weather events or by dockworker labor disputes taking place at U.S. East Coast ports.\n21\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding performance obligations of approximately 1.7 million tons for contracts with fixed\nsales prices averaging $151 per ton, excluding freight, as well as 1.6 million tons for contracts with index-based pricing mechanisms. The\nCompany expects to satisfy approximately 36% of these commitments in the fourth quarter of 2024, 63% of these commitments in 2025, and the\nremaining 1% in 2026. Subsequent to the date of the financial statements, the Company obtained additional sales commitments of\napproximately 0.7 million tons.\nThe Company continues to assess its potential rare earth and critical minerals deposit in Wyoming and is making progress in terms of\ninitial mine development and related chemical, metallurgical, and mineralogy testing. Analysis performed to date indicates elevated levels of\nrare earth elements along with significant concentrations of critical minerals Gallium and Germanium. The Company expects to complete its\ntechno-economic analysis of the overall commercial aspects of the opportunity later this year and anticipates beginning construction of a\ndemonstration processing facility in mid to late 2025. Our rare earth elements exploration target is currently in an exploration stage and does\nnot represent, and should not be construed to be, a mineral resource or mineral reserve as such terms are used in subpart 1300 of Regulation S-\nK. The Company also continues its work to advance new carbon product technologies with the goal of commercializing products that use coal\nin both an improved economic and environmental manner.\n22\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n(In thousands, except per share amounts) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue $ 167,411 $ 186,966 $ 495,403 $ 490,795\nCosts and expenses\nCost of sales (exclusive of items shown\nseparately below) 134,731 144,635 397,214 354,383\nAsset retirement obligations accretion 354 349 1,063 1,049\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization 17,811 14,443 48,909 39,850\nSelling, general and administrative\nexpenses 12,921 11,458 37,932 37,519\nTotal costs and expenses 165,817 170,885 485,118 432,801\nOperating income 1,594 16,081 10,285 57,994\nOther income (expense), net (76) 11,333 3,075 15,076\nInterest expense, net (1,696) (2,447) (4,509) (7,274)\nIncome (loss) before tax (178) 24,967 8,851 65,796\nIncome tax expense 61 5,505 1,517 13,521\nNet income (loss) $ (239) $ 19,462 $ 7,334 $ 52,275\nEarnings (loss) per common share\nBasic - Single class (through 6/20/2023) $ — $ — $ — $ 0.71\nBasic - Class A $ (0.03) $ 0.41 $ 0.05 $ 0.44\nTotal $ (0.03) $ 0.41 $ 0.05 $ 1.15\nBasic - Class B $ 0.06 $ 0.17 $ 0.48 $ 0.17\nDiluted - Single class (through 6/20/23) $ — $ — $ — $ 0.70\nDiluted - Class A $ (0.03) $ 0.40 $ 0.05 $ 0.44\nTotal $ (0.03) $ 0.40 $ 0.05 $ 1.14\nDiluted - Class B $ 0.06 $ 0.16 $ 0.46 $ 0.16\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 23,617 $ 45,407 $ 76,596 $ 123,675\nNet income and Adjusted EBITDA for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were negatively impacted by the\nsoftening of global metallurgical coal markets and the decrease in metallurgical coal price indices. This occurred due to a variety of\nmacroeconomic factors including the continued Chinese oversupply of steel into a muted global economic environment. Refer to Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures later in Item 2 for more information regarding Adjusted EBITDA.\n23\nTable of Contents\nCoal sales information is summarized as follows:\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\nIncrease Increase\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 (Decrease) 2024 2023 (Decrease)\nRevenue $ 167,411 $ 186,966$ (19,555) $ 495,403 $ 490,795$ 4,608\nTons sold 1,023 996 27 2,867 2,467 400\nTotal revenue per ton sold (GAAP basis) $ 164 $ 188$ (24) $ 173 $ 199$ (26)\nCost of sales $ 134,731 $ 144,635$ (9,904) $ 397,214 $ 354,383$ 42,831\nTons sold 1,023 996 27 2,867 2,467 400\nTotal cost of sales per ton sold (GAAP basis) $ 132 $ 145$ (13) $ 139 $ 144$ (5)\nRefer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for supplemental\ncalculations of revenue per ton sold (FOB mine) and cash\ncost per ton sold (FOB mine)\nOur revenue includes sales of Company produced coal and coal purchased from third parties. We include amounts billed by us for\ntransportation to our customers within revenue and transportation costs incurred within cost of sales.\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nRevenue. Coal sales revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $167.4 million, approximately 10% lower than the same\nperiod in 2023 driven by the negative impact of pricing offset partially by the 3% increase in tons sold. The increase in tons sold occurred in\nexport markets, which increased 13% but were offset partially by the decrease in North America volumes. Revenue per ton sold decreased 13%\nfrom $188 per ton for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $164 per ton for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and was\ndriven by the variability in index-based pricing for export sales. Revenue per ton sold (FOB mine), a non-GAAP measure which excludes\ntransportation revenues and demurrage, also decreased 13% from $157 per ton for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $136 per ton\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures later in Item 2 for more information regarding this\nmeasure. The decrease in the Company’s revenue per ton sold measures was due to the decrease in metallurgical coal prices as U.S.\nmetallurgical coal indices continued to fall in the third quarter of 2024 by an average of 7% due to the macroeconomic conditions discussed\nearlier. We expect metallurgical coal prices to remain volatile in the near term.\nThere are no revenues from rare earth and critical minerals at this time.\nCost of sales. Our cost of coal sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $134.7 million, approximately 7% lower than the\nsame period in 2023 despite the 3% increase in tons sold discussed above. Cost of sales per ton sold decreased 9% from $145 per ton for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023 to $132 per ton for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Cash cost per ton sold (FOB mine), a\nnon-GAAP measure which excludes transportation costs, alternative mineral development costs, and idle mine costs, decreased 10% from $113\nper ton for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $102 per ton for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures later in Item 2 for more information regarding this measure. Mine costs for the third quarter of 2024 benefited from\nefficiencies gained from increased production versus the same period in 2023.\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense totaled $17.8 million and $14.4 million for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase year-to-year was related to $1.3 million of\nadditional amortization for the Knox Creek Jawbone mine, which is due to the closure of the mine, as well as the general increases in plant and\nequipment and production versus 2023.\n24\nTable of Contents\nSelling, general, and administrative. Selling, general, and administrative (\"SG&A”) expenses were $12.9 million and $11.5 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The $1.5 million increase in 2024 was primarily due to the\nincrease in stock-based compensation expense.\nOther income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net was ($0.1) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to\n$11.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other income, net in the third quarter of 2023 was due primarily to recognition of\nthe $7.8 million legal verdict for contract (compensatory) damages related to the 2018 Elk Creek silo failure as well as the receipt of $3.0 million\nof insurance proceeds related to the methane ignition that occurred at our Berwind complex in 2022.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net was $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $2.4 million for the\nsame period in 2023. The decrease in 2024 was largely due to the repayment in full of related-party debt in the fourth quarter of 2023 associated\nwith the financing of the acquisition of Ramaco Coal from Yorktown Partners. Interest expense related to this financing was $0.4 million in the\nthird quarter of 2023.\nIncome tax expense (benefit). The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 9% and\n22%, respectively, excluding the impact of discrete items. The primary differences from the federal statutory rate of 21% are related to state\ntaxes, non-deductible expenses, the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, and depletion expense for income tax purposes.\nEarnings (loss) per share. Refer to Note 10 of Part I, Item 1 for information regarding earnings per share calculations for Class A and\nClass B common stock.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nRevenue. Coal sales revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $495.4 million, approximately 1% higher than the same\nperiod in 2023 due to the increase in tons sold, which was mostly offset by the negative impact of pricing. The 16% increase in tons sold\noccurred in both North America and export markets, with export volumes increasing by 20% and North America volumes increasing by 10%,\nand was aided by the Company’s increased capacity for production achieved during late 2023. Revenue per ton sold decreased 13% from $199\nper ton for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $173 per ton for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and was driven by the\nvariability in index-based pricing for export sales. Revenue per ton sold (FOB mine), a non-GAAP measure which excludes transportation\nrevenues and demurrage, decreased 14% from $169 per ton for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $145 per ton for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures later in Item 2 for more information regarding this measure. U.S.\nmetallurgical coal price indices have fallen by roughly 32% on a year-to-date basis driven by the macroeconomic conditions discussed\npreviously. We expect metallurgical coal prices to remain volatile in the near term.\nThere are no revenues from rare earth and critical minerals at this time.\nCost of sales. Our cost of coal sales totaled $397.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $354.4 million for the\nsame period in 2023. The 12% increase was driven by the increase in tons sold, as discussed directly above. Cost of sales per ton sold\ndecreased 3% from $144 per ton for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $139 per ton for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nCash cost per ton sold (FOB mine), a non-GAAP measure which excludes transportation costs, alternative mineral development costs, and\nidle mine costs, decreased 2% from $111 per ton for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $109 per ton for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures later in Item 2 for more information regarding this measure. Mine costs for 2024\nwere impacted negatively by challenging geology and labor constraints in the first quarter of 2024 but improved during the second and third\nquarters of 2024 due to efficiencies gained from increased production compared to the same periods in 2023.\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense totaled $48.9 million and $39.9 million for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase\n25\nTable of Contents\nyear-to-year was related to $1.2 million of additional amortization for the Knox Creek Jawbone mine, which is due to the closure of the mine, as\nwell as the general increases in plant and equipment and production versus 2023.\nSelling, general, and administrative. SG&A expenses were $37.9 million and $37.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand September 30, 2023, respectively. SG&A expenses in 2024 include a $3.1 million benefit accrued for the probable recovery of attorney fees\nrelated to the silo failure litigation developments, which is not indicative of future SG&A expenses. This matter offset most of the 2024\nincrease in stock-based compensation.\nOther income (expense), net. Other income, net was $3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was primarily\nrelated to the $2.2 million recovery of previously incurred demurrage and other transportation-related matters. Other income, net was $15.1\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was due primarily to recognition of the $7.8 million legal verdict for contract\n(compensatory) damages related to the 2018 Elk Creek silo failure as well as the $4.9 million gain from the Company’s insurance claim related to\nthe methane ignition that occurred at our Berwind complex in 2022. The Company received $6.0 million of proceeds during the nine months\nended September 30, 2023 related to the Berwind ignition and had previously accrued a $1.1 million loss recovery asset at year-end 2022.\nThese activities are not indicative of future results.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net was $4.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $7.3 million for the\nsame period in 2023. The decrease in 2024 was largely due to the repayment in full of related-party debt in 2023 associated with the financing\nof the acquisition of Ramaco Coal from Yorktown Partners. Interest expense related to this financing totaled $1.7 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023.\nIncome tax expense. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 28% and 21%,\nrespectively, excluding the $1.0 million favorable impact of discrete items in 2024. The primary differences from the federal statutory rate of\n21% are related to state taxes, non-deductible expenses, the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, and depletion expense for income tax\npurposes.\nEarnings per share. Refer to Note 10 of Part I, Item 1 for information regarding earnings per share calculations for Class A and Class B\ncommon stock.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe metallurgical coal markets are volatile in nature; therefore, the Company prioritizes managing its financial position and liquidity, while\nmanaging costs and capital expenditures and returning value to its shareholders.\nOn May 3, 2024, the Company entered into the First Amendment Agreement to the Second Amended and Restated Credit and Security\nAgreement in order to, among other things, extend the maturity date and increase the size of its existing Revolving Credit Facility. The\namended facility has a maturity date of May 3, 2029, and provides an initial aggregate revolving commitment of $200 million as well as an\naccordion feature to increase the size by an additional $75 million subject to certain terms and conditions, including the lenders’ consent. The\namended facility provides the Company with additional flexibility to pursue further growth in production while meeting normal operating\nrequirements. The terms of the amended facility also require the Company to maintain certain covenants, including fixed charge coverage ratio\nand compensating balance requirements. Borrowings under the amended facility may not exceed the borrowing base as determined under the\namended formula included in the agreement.\nAt September 30, 2024, we had $22.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $57.9 million of remaining availability under our Revolving\nCredit Facility for future borrowings. Cash and cash equivalents include $7.5 million of compensating balances held in dedicated accounts to\nassure future credit availability under the revolver. The Company’s total current assets were $146.7 million and were in excess of total current\nliabilities by $37.9 million as of the balance sheet date.\n26\nTable of Contents\nSignificant sources and uses of cash during the first nine months of 2024\nSources of cash:\n● Cash flows provided by operating activities were $97.0 million during the first nine months of 2024, which were driven primarily\nby net earnings adjusted for non-cash expenses including depreciation, depletion, and amortization as well as stock-based\ncompensation. Changes in operating assets and liabilities also contributed to operating cash flow driven primarily by the\ndecrease in accounts receivable due to the collection of fourth quarter 2023 revenues, which were $35.3 million higher than third\nquarter 2024 revenues.\nUses of cash:\n● Capital expenditures totaled $57.9 million, including expenditures related to the preparation plant and expansion of our Maben\ncomplex. Capital expenditures for the Maben preparation plant totaled $12.3 million, including approximately $3 million for the\ninitial purchase of the plant. The preparation plant at Maben was commissioned in October 2024, which should reduce trucking\ncosts at the complex going forward. The Company anticipates lower capital spending in the fourth quarter of 2024 as most of the\nCompany’s annual growth capital expenditures occurred in the first half of 2024.\n● Cash outflows for financing activities totaled $58.0 million, which included:\no net repayments of $24.2 million on our existing debt, finance leases, and insurance financing and\no net outflow of $33.8 million to stockholders driven by dividend payments of $24.5 million, which include $18.2 million for\nClass A common stock and $6.2 million for Class B common stock.\nThe Class B common stock dividends were calculated based on 20% of the previous quarter’s CORE royalty and infrastructure fees\nas shown below.

We expect to fund our\ncapital and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months and the reasonably foreseeable future with cash on hand, borrowings under our\nrevolving credit facility, projected cash flows from operations, and, if warranted, capital raised under the Company’s shelf registration\ndiscussed below. Factors that could adversely impact our future liquidity and ability to carry out our capital expenditure program include the\nfollowing:\n● Timely delivery of our product by rail and other transportation carriers;\n● Late payments of accounts receivable by our customers;\n● Cost overruns in our purchases of equipment needed to complete our mine development plans;\n● Delays in completion of development of our various mines, processing plants and refuse disposal facilities, which would reduce the\ncoal we would have available to sell and our cash flow from operations; and\n● Adverse changes in the metallurgical coal markets that would reduce the expected cash flow from operations.\nIf future cash flows were to become insufficient to meet our liquidity needs or capital requirements, due to changes in macroeconomic\nconditions or otherwise, we may reduce our expected level of capital expenditures for new mine production and/or fund a portion of our capital\nexpenditures through the issuance of debt or equity securities, new debt arrangements, or from other sources such as asset sales.\nOn September 1, 2023, the Company filed a shelf registration statement to sell any combination of Class A common stock, Class B\ncommon stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities, warrants, and rights at an aggregate initial offering price of up to $400.0\nmillion. No securities may be sold until a prospectus supplement describing the method and terms of any future offering is delivered.\nRefer to Note 4 of Part I, Item 1 for information regarding the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility and indebtedness.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nconsolidated financial statements and the amounts of revenue and expenses reported for the period then ended. A discussion of our critical\naccounting policies and estimates is included in \"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” of the Annual Report. There were no material changes to our critical accounting\npolicies during the first nine months of 2024.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nA discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements is included under the heading \"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations - Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” in the Annual Report. There were no material changes\nduring the first nine months of 2024.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA - Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure by management and external users of our\nfinancial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it\nallows us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus net interest expense; stock-based compensation expense; depreciation, depletion, and\namortization expenses; income taxes; accretion of asset retirement obligations; and, when applicable, certain other non-operating items\n(income tax penalties and charitable contributions). A reconciliation of net\n28\nTable of Contents\nincome to Adjusted EBITDA is included below.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nDisclosures about market risk are included in Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” of our Annual\nReport.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our\nmanagement, including our chief executive officer, who serves as our principal executive officer, and our chief financial officer, who serves as\nour principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under\nthe Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to\nprovide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is\naccumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to\nallow timely decisions regarding required disclosures, and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified\nin the rules and forms of the SEC. However, based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded\nthat our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this\nquarterly report as a result of the two material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as described below.\nPreviously Reported Material Weakness\nWe previously identified a material weakness and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of\nDecember 31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, management identified a material weakness related to a pervasive lack of sufficient\ndocumentation of accounting policies, procedures, and controls. This lack of sufficient documentation does not allow management to\neffectively assess its relevant risks and key controls to properly test for design and operating effectiveness. A material weakness is a control\ndeficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a\nmaterial misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\n30\nTable of Contents\nRemediation Plan\nWe have developed a plan of remediation to address this material weakness, which will include assessing, redesigning, and implementing\nmodifications to our internal controls. We will not be able to fully remediate this material weakness until these steps have been completed and\nsubsequent validation and testing of these internal controls have demonstrated their operating effectiveness over a sustained period of\nfinancial reporting cycles. Once the remediation plan is fully developed, we will be implementing process, control, and documentation\nimprovements to address the above material weakness that include, but are not limited to, designing and implementing specific management\nreview procedures to ensure completeness and accuracy of key financial and non-financial data utilized in our business; and implementing\nimproved policies, procedures, and control activities over key financial data to ensure accuracy and completeness of this data as used in the\naforementioned management review procedures.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe are actively improving our control environment by executing our remediation plan to address the material weakness, as described\nabove. Our remediation process has resulted in changes to our control environment that we believe represent changes in our system of\ninternal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this quarterly\nreport that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nAdditionally, during the most recent fiscal period, management determined that a material weakness existed related to inappropriate\nsegregation of duties related to certain individuals having both system administrator responsibilities within the Company’s Enterprise\nResource Planning (\"ERP”) financial system and responsibilities for certain accounting and financial reporting functions. The inappropriate\nsegregation of duties was not appropriately mitigated by the monitoring controls implemented to ensure individuals with system administrator\naccess did not make unauthorized changes to the Company’s information systems impacting the financial reporting of the Company. We have\nimplemented an enhanced monitoring control as of the end of the third quarter of 2024, which we believe is designed effectively to remediate\nthe aforementioned material weakness; however, additional testing will be required in the fourth quarter to ensure that the enhanced control\nactivities are operating as designed before we can conclude the material weakness has been remediated.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nSenior members of management do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting\nwill prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\nassurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may\nnot prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls\nmay become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n31\nTable of Contents\nPART II.

Sussman\nJeremy R. Sussman\nChief Financial Officer\nExhibit 95.1\nFederal Mine Safety and Health Act Information\nWe work to prevent accidents and occupational illnesses. We have in place health and safety programs that include extensive employee training, safety\nincentives, drug and alcohol testing and safety audits. The objectives of our health and safety programs are to provide a safe work environment, provide\nemployees with proper training and equipment and implement safety and health rules, policies and programs that foster safety excellence.\nOur mining operations are subject to extensive and stringent compliance standards established pursuant to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977\n(the \"Mine Act”). Mine Safety and Health Administration (\"MSHA”) monitors and rigorously enforces compliance with these standards, and our mining\noperations are inspected frequently. Citations and orders are issued by MSHA under Section 104 of the Mine Act for violations of the Mine Act or any\nmandatory health or safety standard, rule, order or regulation promulgated under the Mine Act.\nSection 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act”) and Item 104 of Regulation S-K require issuers to\ninclude in periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission certain information relating to citations or orders for violations of standards\nunder the Mine Act. We present information below regarding certain mining safety and health violations, orders and citations, issued by MSHA and related\nassessments and legal actions and mine-related fatalities with respect to our coal mining operations. In evaluating this information, consideration should be\ngiven to factors such as: (i) the number of violations, orders and citations will vary depending on the size of the coal mine, (ii) the number of violations, orders\nand citations issued will vary from inspector to inspector and mine to mine, and (iii) violations, orders and citations can be contested and appealed, and in that\nprocess, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed.\nThe following tables include information required by the Dodd-Frank Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K for the current quarter.

Shareholders can attend the virtual Annual Meeting by visiting\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/METC2024.\nWhy is the Annual Meeting a virtual meeting?\nWe have decided to hold our Annual Meeting virtually. We believe that hosting a virtual meeting will enable greater shareholder\nattendance and participation from any location around the world.\nOn what am I voting?\nBoard\nItem Description More Information Recommendation\nItem 1: Election of directors Page 5 FOR\neach nominee\nItem 2: Advisory vote on executive compensation Page 54 FOR\nItem 3: Simple Majority Voting Page 55 AGAINST\nWho may vote?\nShareholders of record of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock (together, the \"Common Stock”) at the close\nof business on April 29, 2024, may vote at the meeting. Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote\ntogether as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders. As of April 29, 2024, there was a total of\n53,089,357 shares of our Common Stock outstanding, consisting of 44,263,429 shares of Class A common stock and 8,825,928\nshares of Class B common stock.\nHow many votes do I have?\nYou have one vote for each share of our Common Stock (you owned as of the record date for the meeting).\nHow do I vote?\nOur proxy materials are available to shareholders on the Internet and by mail. You may read, print and download our 2023 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, Proxy Statement and proxy card at http://www.proxyvote.com. On an ongoing basis, shareholders may\nrequest to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by e-mail. You may vote your shares by the Internet at\nhttp://www.proxyvote.com prior to the meeting, by regular mail or by attending and voting at the virtual meeting by visiting\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/METC2024. Each of these voting options is described in the Notice of Availability of Proxy\nMaterials (the \"Notice of Availability” or \"Notice”) and the proxy card.\nTo ensure that your vote is counted at the meeting, regardless of whether you plan to attend the meeting virtually, you should vote\nby using the Internet voting option on your proxy card or mailing in your proxy card to Ramaco Resources’ address shown above. If\nyou return an executed proxy card without marking your\n1\nTable of Contents\ninstructions, your executed proxy card will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the board of directors (the \"Board”\nor \"Board of Directors”). If you indicate a choice with respect to any matter to be acted upon on your proxy card or voting instruction\ncard, your shares will be voted per your instructions.\nWhat are the Board of Director’s recommendations?\nThe Board of Director’s recommendations are set forth together with the description of each item in this Proxy Statement. In\nsummary, the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee recommend a vote as follows:\n● FOR\nProposal 1, the election of the three nominees named in this Proxy Statement as directors.\n● FOR\nProposal 2, the approval, on an advisory basis, of the Company’s executive compensation as reported in this\nProxy Statement.\n● AGAINST\nProposal 3, the change to the Company’s governing documents that would revise all provisions that\ncurrently require more than a majority vote to a majority-only vote.\nIf any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, we will vote the shares in accordance with our best judgment and\ndiscretion.\nWhat if I change my mind after I have voted?\nYou may revoke your proxy before it is voted by:\n● submitting a new proxy card with a later date;\n● attending the virtual Annual Meeting and following the voting instructions provided on the meeting website; or\n● giving written notice to the Corporate Secretary at Ramaco Resources’ address shown above.\nWill my shares be voted if I do not provide my proxy and don’t attend the Annual Meeting?\nBrokerage firms are subject to the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE”). The NYSE rules direct that certain matters\nsubmitted to a vote of shareholders are \"routine” items and brokers generally may vote on behalf of beneficial owners who have not\nfurnished voting instructions, subject to the rules of the NYSE concerning transmission of proxy materials to beneficial owners, and\nsubject to any proxy voting policies and procedures of those brokerage firms. Brokers who hold shares in \"street name” for\ncustomers who are beneficial owners of such shares are prohibited from giving a proxy to vote such customers’ shares on \"non-\nroutine” matters in the absence of specific instructions from such customers.\nWe believe Proposal One, Proposal Two and Proposal Three are non-routine matters and, therefore, the broker may not vote your\nshares on such proposals without receiving instructions from you. If your broker does not vote on a proposal, this is commonly\nreferred to as a \"broker non-vote.” Broker non-votes, if any, will not be counted as having been voted in person or by proxy, but\npursuant to Delaware corporate law, they will (under certain circumstances) be counted for purposes of determining whether a\nquorum is present. Since none of the proposals are \"routine” matters, if you do not provide voting instructions, your shares will not\nbe voted by brokers and will not be counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present.\nHow do I attend the virtual meeting?\nTo attend and participate in the Annual Meeting, shareholders will need to access the live audio webcast of the meeting. To do so,\nshareholders of record will need to visit www. virtualshareholdermeeting.com/METC2024\n2\nTable of Contents\nand use their 16-digit Control Number provided in the Notice to log in to the website, and beneficial owners of shares held in street\nname will need to follow the instructions provided by the broker, bank or other nominee that holds their shares. We would\nencourage shareholders to log in to this website and access the webcast at least 15 minutes before the meeting to ensure you are\nlogged in when the meeting starts. We intend to offer the same participation opportunities as would be provided at an in-person\nmeeting.\nWhat constitutes a quorum?\nTo carry on the business of the meeting, we must have a quorum. This means at least a majority of the voting power of all of the\noutstanding shares of stock entitled to vote as of the record date must be represented at the meeting, either by proxy or by joining\nthe virtual meeting. Shares of Common Stock owned by Ramaco Resources are not voted and do not count for this purpose.\nWhile abstentions and proxies submitted by brokers that do not indicate a vote, because they do not have discretionary authority\nand have not received instructions as to how to vote on a proposal (so-called \"broker non-votes”), are generally considered as\npresent for quorum purposes, this only applies if brokers are able to vote on at least one routine matter. We believe that because\nnone of the proposals presented at the Annual Meeting are considered \"routine’ matters,” brokers will not be casting votes on any\nproposals. Consequently, broker non-votes will not be counted as present for the purposes of determining whether a quorum is\npresent.\nWhat vote is required to approve the proposals?\nThe following votes must be received:\n● With respect to Proposal 1, under our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the \"Bylaws”), directors are elected by a plurality of\nthe votes cast at the meeting, so long as a quorum is present. This means that the directors who receive the most \"for” votes\nare elected up to the maximum number of directors to be elected at a meeting at which a quorum is present. \"Withhold” votes\nand broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of the vote. The directors in the other classes will continue for the reminder of\ntheir respective terms.\n● With respect to Proposal 2, regarding the vote to approve, on an advisory basis, the Company’s executive compensation as\nreported in this Proxy Statement, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at\nthe meeting and entitled to vote on the matter would be required for approval. Abstentions have the effect of a vote against this\nproposal. Broker non-votes, if any, will not affect the outcome of the vote. Because the vote on Proposal 2 is advisory and\ntherefore will not be binding on the Company, the board will review the voting result and take it into consideration when making\nfuture decisions regarding executive compensation.\n● With respect to Proposal 3, regarding voting, on an advisory basis, on the change to the Company’s governing documents\nthat would revise all provisions that currently require more than a majority vote to a majority-only vote, the affirmative vote of a\nmajority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter would be\nrequired for approval. Abstentions have the effect of a vote against this proposal. Broker non-votes, if any, will not affect the\noutcome of the vote. Because the vote on Proposal 3 is advisory, and therefore will not be binding on the Company, the Board\nof Directors will review the voting result and take it into consideration when making future decisions regarding the voting\nstandard in the Company’s governing documents.\nWho conducts the proxy solicitation and how much will it cost?\nRamaco Resources is requesting your proxy for the annual shareholder meeting and will pay all the costs of requesting shareholder\nproxies. We can request proxies through the mail or by telephone, fax or Internet. We can use directors, officers and other\nemployees of Ramaco Resources to request proxies. Directors, officers and other employees will not receive additional\ncompensation for these services. We have engaged Saratoga Proxy Consulting, LLC (\"Saratoga”), a proxy soliciting firm, to assist\nwith the solicitation of proxies for\n3\nTable of Contents\na fee of $12,500.00, plus expenses. Saratoga may solicit the return of proxies, either by mail, telephone, email or through personal\ncontact. The cost of solicitation will be borne by us, including the fees of Saratoga. We will also reimburse brokerage firms,\nnominees, fiduciaries, custodians and other agents for their expenses in distributing proxy material to the beneficial owners of our\nCommon Stock.\n4\nTable of Contents\nITEM 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS\nNominees for Directors\nOur Board is currently composed of nine members. Effective April 13, 2022, the Board approved the implementation of a staggered\nboard pursuant to the terms of the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, consisting of three classes.

To facilitate the search process, the Nominating and Corporate Governance\nCommittee may also consult with outside advisors or retain search firms to assist in the search for qualified candidates, or consider\ndirector candidates recommended by our shareholders. In assessing the qualifications of candidates for nomination as director, in\naddition to qualifications set forth in our Bylaws and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter, the Nominating and\nCorporate Governance Committee also considers whether a candidate possesses the integrity, judgment, knowledge, experience,\nskills and expertise that are likely to enhance the Board of Directors’ ability to manage and direct our affairs and business,\nincluding, when applicable, to enhance the ability of the committees of the Board of Directors to fulfill their duties.\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews the overall composition of the Board, including the skills represented\nby incumbent directors, and the need for Board refreshment or expansion. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nand the Board also consider the diversity of the Board and believes that a diverse membership enhances the Board’s deliberations\nand promotes inclusiveness. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has identified the following areas of expertise\nthat are particularly relevant to service on the Board:\n● Governance/Board — Prior or current experience as a board member of a major organization (private, public or non-profit).\n● Finance and Accounting — Senior executive-level experience or membership on a board audit committee with an extensive\nunderstanding of finance and accounting matters such as capital markets, corporate finance, M&A, financial accounting and\nreporting, auditing, Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and internal controls.\n● Industry — Extensive knowledge and experience in the coal and steel industries.\nAlthough the Board is willing to consider candidates recommended by our shareholders, it has not adopted a formal policy with\nregard to the consideration of any director candidates recommended by our shareholders. The Board believes that a formal policy is\nnot necessary or appropriate because the current Board already has a diversity of business background and industry experience.\nOur Board will consider director candidates recommended by shareholders who are highly qualified in terms of business experience\nand both willing and expressly interested in serving on the Board. Shareholders recommending candidates for consideration should\nsend their recommendations to us at our principal executive offices (Ramaco Resources, Inc., 250 West Main Street, Suite 1900,\nLexington, Kentucky 40507) in accordance with the procedures described in our Bylaws. Unless the Board determines otherwise,\nthe 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be held on or about June 26, 2025. The Board will therefore consider\nrecommendations for the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders if they are received on or after the close of business on February\n26, 2025, but no later than the close of business on March 28, 2025.\nIn addition to satisfying the foregoing requirements and those set forth under our Bylaws, shareholders who intend to solicit proxies\nin support of director nominees other than our nominees must comply with the additional requirements of Rule 14a-19(b) under the\nExchange Act to comply with the universal proxy rules. The requirements under the universal proxy rules are in addition to the\napplicable procedural requirements under our Bylaws described above.\n10\nTable of Contents\nBoard Diversity\nThe Board recognizes that its success hinges on its ability to meet a broad spectrum of challenges, and successfully navigating\nthese challenges demands not only a diverse set of perspectives, backgrounds, and skills, but strong communication and\ncollaboration among the whole Board. To that end, the Board’s composition and culture is crucial. Our goal is a balanced and\ndiverse board, with members who bring a diversity of skills, expertise, experiences, perspectives, tenures and personal\ncharacteristics, including with regard to race, gender, age, and ethnicity. We are also committed to a balanced approach to director\ntenure, allowing the Board to benefit from the knowledge and experience of longer-serving directors as well as fresh perspectives\nfrom newer directors.\nIn compliance with NASDAQ Rule 5605(f), we are providing the matrix table below which illustrates our current board level diversity\nstatistics.

Any questionable situation is required to\nbe disclosed to an employee’s direct supervisor or the Chief Compliance Officer, which is currently our General Counsel.\nPursuant to our Code of Conduct and our Related Persons Transactions Policy, the Board has delegated to the Audit Committee\nthe responsibility for reviewing and resolving any issues with respect to related-party transactions and conflicts of interests involving\nsenior officers or directors of the Company or other related persons under the applicable rules of the SEC.

Randall W. Atkins, our Chief Executive Officer, serves as the Chairman of the Board. Although the Board believes that the\ncombination of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles is appropriate in current circumstances, the Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer roles were separate from 2017 through 2020.\nOur Board structure includes strong oversight by independent directors.

We believe these agreements\n17\nTable of Contents\nwere on terms which would be obtained on an arm’s length basis for similar transactions. Other than Knox Creek, properties\nassociated with the acquisition of certain assets from Coronado IV LLC and Buchanan Minerals, LLC (the \"Amonate Assets”)\nlocated in McDowell County, West Virginia and Tazewell County, Virginia and properties located in Wyoming County and Raleigh\nCounty, West Virginia, associated with the acquisition of the equity interests of Maben Coal LLC which occurred in 2022, those\nproperties constitute most of the land we currently control in connection with our business operations. The terms and conditions of\nthose agreements are summarized below.\nYorktown IX and Randall Atkins were owners of Ramaco Coal, LLC until April 29, 2022, when the Company acquired all of the\nequity interests of Ramaco Coal, LLC. Immediately prior to April 29, 2022, Mr. Atkins held an 11% ownership interest in Ramaco\nCoal, LLC, and served as its Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nRamaco Coal Acquisition\nOn April 29, 2022, we completed and closed on a transaction involving an agreement in principle for our subsidiary, Ramaco\nDevelopment, LLC, to acquire 100% of the equity interests of Ramaco Coal (the \"Acquisition\"). The consideration for the\nAcquisition consisted of (i) an initial payment of $10 million due at closing and (ii) an aggregate deferred purchase price of $55\nmillion, consisting of (A) $15 million, to be paid during the remainder of 2022, and (B) $40 million, to be paid during 2023 in $10\nmillion ratable quarterly installments. The Special Committee of Independent Directors (the \"Special Committee\") of the Board of\nDirectors negotiated and approved the Acquisition.\nGiven certain common ownership between Ramaco Coal, LLC and the Company and the complex contractual obligations under the\nfollowing documents, conflicts could arise among or between Ramaco Coal, LLC, Yorktown, Mr. Atkins and the Company. In\naddition, a conflict may arise which could adversely affect the interests of our shareholders, including, without limitation, conflicts\ninvolving compliance with payment and performance obligations under existing leases, and negotiation of the terms of and\nperformance under additional leases we may enter into with affiliates in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2023 Ramaco had retired all remaining installment notes in connection with the Acquisition and had no more\ncontinuing obligations in connection with this Acquisition.\nOther Transactions\nOn April 1, 2023, Ramaco Carbon, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company,\nretained the brother of Mr. Atkins, to provide management services related to research and analysis of existing carbon products and\ndevelopment of new products for commercialization at an annual rate of compensation of $220,000 plus potential annual cash\nbonuses dependent upon both Company and individual performance.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company paid $142,000 for information technology and public affairs services to an\nentity owned by the son of Mr. Atkins.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company paid $608,000 to the law firm of Jones & Associates for legal services.\nMr. Jones is the owner and manager of Jones & Associates.\nReview, Approval or Ratification of Transactions With Related Persons\nWe maintain a written Related Persons Transactions Policy (the \"Policy”) for approval of related party transactions.

Directors and executive officers must inform the Compliance Officer at the earliest practicable time of any plan or\nproposal to engage in a potential Related Persons Transaction and supply the Compliance Officer with full details regarding the\nterms and circumstances of such transaction, including information required to be supplied to enable the Audit Committee to make\nits determination, as\n19\nTable of Contents\nprovided for above. If the Compliance Officer is involved in a potential Related Persons Transaction, he or she must inform the Chief\nExecutive Officer and the Committee.\nFurther, the Policy requires that all Related Persons Transactions required to be disclosed in the Company’s filings with the SEC\nbe so disclosed in accordance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations.

For fiscal year 2023, our Named\nExecutive Officers, were:\n● Randall W. Atkins, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board;\n● Jeremy R. Sussman, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary;\n● Christopher L. Blanchard, Chief Operating Officer;\n● Jason T. Fannin, Chief Commercial Officer; and\n● John C. Marcum, Chief Accounting Officer.\nCompensation Philosophy and Objectives\nCompensation amounts historically have been determined by the Compensation Committee based on a variety of informal factors\nincluding our financial condition and available resources, our need to attract and retain executive talent and the compensation levels\nof our other executive officers, each as of the time of the applicable compensation decision. In making such determinations, the\nCompensation Committee has considered the competitive market for corresponding positions within members of our peer group,\nbased on its general knowledge regarding the compensation provided to executive officers of such other companies in our industry\nthrough informal discussions with recruiting firms, research, personal knowledge of the competitive market as well as market data\nprovided by our independent compensation consultant Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC (\"Meridian”). As a result, our\nCompensation Committee does not formally benchmark executive compensation against our peer group or use a formula to set the\ncompensation for our executives in relation to survey data. Our Compensation Committee, in consultation with Meridian, made\ncompensation decisions for our executive officers based on the various factors and data described above and, for all Named\nExecutive Officers other than our Chief Executive Officer, the recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer, as further described\nbelow.\nOur Compensation Committee believes our compensation program to be well designed to achieve the following objectives:\n● attract and retain talented and experienced executives in our industry;\n● reward executives whose knowledge, skills and performance are critical to our success;\n● align the interests of our executive officers and shareholders by motivating executive officers to increase shareholder value\nand rewarding executive officers when shareholder value increases;\n● ensure fairness among the executive management team by recognizing the contributions each executive makes to our\nsuccess;\n● foster a shared commitment among executives by aligning their individual goals with the goals of the executive\nmanagement team and our Company; and\n26\nTable of Contents\n● compensate our executives in a manner that incentivizes them to manage our business to meet our long-range objectives.\nCompensation Committee Procedures and Role of Compensation Consultant\nFor executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee receives and reviews reports and\nrecommendations from the Chief Executive Officer regarding the performance and recommended compensation of the other\nexecutive officers of the Company, and the Compensation Committee recommends to the Board the annual compensation,\nincluding salary, incentive and equity compensation, for such officers. The Chief Executive Officer may be present during\nCompensation Committee discussions evaluating and setting the compensation levels of the Company’s executive officers other\nthan for the Chief Executive Officer but may not vote on such deliberations. The Compensation Committee also annually analyzes\nour Chief Executive Officer’s performance and recommends to the Board his base salary, cash performance awards and grants of\nlong-term equity incentive awards based on its assessment of his performance with input from any consultants engaged by the\nCompensation Committee. The Compensation Committee has met both formally and informally prior to acting to establish\nexecutive compensation. The Compensation Committee considers various items in its deliberations related to executive\ncompensation including, without limitation, comparative compensation programs utilized by others in the industry, the importance\nof our executives to the ongoing success and operation of the Company and certain performance parameters related to our\nexecutives and the overall business.\nIn order to ensure that we continue to remunerate our executives appropriately, the Compensation Committee has retained\nMeridian. Meridian assists the Compensation Committee by providing comparative market data on compensation practices and\nprograms based on an analysis of peer competitors and by providing guidance on industry best practices. Meridian performs no\nother work for us. The Compensation Committee regularly reviews the consultant’s independence relative to key factors identified in\nthe applicable listing standards of NASDAQ. Based on its assessment, the Compensation Committee concluded that Meridian is\nindependent and that no conflicts of interest exist.\nThe Compensation Committee has worked with Meridian to develop our compensation peer group, which is used in the decision-\nmaking process to determine the compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers. Our compensation peer group is primarily\ncomprised of companies within the coal extraction industry. The coal extraction industry has unique dynamics and requires a\nunique set of skills and experience. Since there are a limited number of publicly-traded coal extraction companies, and to ensure a\nsufficient number of companies were included in our compensation peer group, the group also includes companies in other\nextraction industries (primarily oil and gas). Our compensation peer group was updated during 2023 and is comprised of the\nfollowing companies:\nAlliance Resource Partners, L.P. Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc.\nArch Resources, Inc. Berry Corporation\nCompass Minerals International, Inc. CONSOL Energy Inc.\nCoronado Global Resources Inc. Hallador Energy Company\nPeabody Energy Corporation Piedmont Lithium Inc.\nRing Energy, Inc. SunCoke Energy, Inc.\nTalos Energy Inc. Tellurian Inc.\nWarrior Met Coal, Inc.\nElements of Compensation\nOur current executive compensation program, which was set by our Compensation Committee, consists of the following\ncomponents:\n● base salary;\n27\nTable of Contents\n● annual cash incentive awards linked to overall company and individual performance;\n● periodic grants of long-term equity-based compensation, such as restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance\nstock units;\n● other executive benefits; and\n● a severance plan for certain executives, which contains termination and change of control benefits.\nWe combine these elements in order to formulate compensation packages that provide competitive pay, reward the achievement of\nfinancial, operational and strategic objectives and align the interests of our executive officers and other senior personnel with those\nof our shareholders.\nPay Mix\nWe utilize the particular elements of compensation described above because we believe that it provides a well-proportioned mix of\nsecure compensation, retention value and at-risk compensation which produces short-term and long-term performance incentives\nand rewards. By following this approach, we provide the executive a measure of security in the minimum expected level of\ncompensation, while motivating the executive to focus on business metrics that will produce a high level of short-term and long-term\nperformance for the Company and long-term wealth creation for the executive, as well as reducing the risk of recruitment of top\nexecutive talent by competitors. The mix of metrics used for our annual cash bonus and long-term incentive program likewise\nprovides an appropriate balance between short-term financial performance and long-term financial and stock performance.\nFor key executives, the mix of compensation is weighted relatively evenly between short-term and long-term at-risk pay (annual\ntarget incentive cash bonus and long-term incentives). The direct compensation opportunity for the executives (base salary, annual\ntarget incentive cash bonus and annual target long-term incentive) results fundamentally in a pay-for-performance orientation, which\nis aligned with our stated compensation philosophy of providing compensation commensurate with performance as demonstrated in\nthe charts below:\nBase Salary\nThe base salary established for each of our executive officers is intended to reflect each individual’s responsibilities, experience,\nprior performance and other discretionary factors deemed relevant by our Compensation Committee. Base salary is also designed\nto provide our executive officers with steady cash flow\n28\nTable of Contents\nduring the course of the fiscal year that is not contingent on short-term variations in our corporate performance. Our Compensation\nCommittee determines market level compensation for base salaries based on our executives’ experience in the industry with\nreference to the base salaries of similarly situated executives in the peer group. The Compensation Committee was also informed\nby Meridian as to establishing base salaries for our executive officers.\nBase salaries for our Named Executive Officers during fiscal year 2023 were generally set at levels deemed by our Compensation\nCommittee as necessary to attract and retain qualified individuals with superior talent commensurate with their relative expertise\nand prior experience. When establishing the base salaries for our Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2023, our\nCompensation Committee specifically considered Meridian’s review and presentation related to the peer group, as well as each of\nour Named Executive Officer’s duties and responsibilities. The salary increases supported the Compensation Committee’s\nobjective to continue to more closely align the Named Executive Officers’ cash compensation with the cash compensation paid to\nexecutives in comparable positions in the peer group, as well as significant growth in performance as it related to a meaningful\nyear-on-year increase in both production and sales.\nThe base salaries paid to our Named Executive Officers in fiscal year 2022 and fiscal year 2023 are set forth in the chart below.\nFiscal Year Fiscal Year\n2022 Base 2023 Base Percent\nNamed Executive Officer Salary Salary(1) Increase\nRandall W.

Marcum $450,000 $550,000 22%\n(1) Pay increases were retroactive to January 1, 2023.\nAnnual Incentive Cash Bonus\nOur Compensation Committee has authority to award annual incentive bonuses to our Named Executive Officers. The annual cash\nbonuses are intended to offer incentive compensation by rewarding the achievement of corporate and individual performance\nobjectives.\nFor fiscal year 2023, the Compensation Committee established the target percentage amounts for the annual incentive cash\nbonuses for each of our Named Executive Officers, as set forth in the chart below.\nFiscal Year\nFiscal Year 2023 Annual\nFiscal Year 2023 Annual Bonus\n2023 Base Bonus Target Target\nNamed Executive Officer Salary Percentage Amount\nRandall W. Atkins $900,000 200% $1,800,000\nJeremy R. Sussman $610,000 150% $915,000\nChristopher L. Blanchard $610,000 150% $915,000\nJason T. Fannin $610,000 150% $915,000\nJohn C. Marcum $550,000 150% $825,000\nHistorically, the annual bonus was entirely discretionary, with the Compensation Committee determining an executive’s bonus\namount after the end of the year taking into account the executive’s individual performance as well as Company performance.\nBeginning in fiscal year 2022, the Compensation Committee took a more structured approach (and more aligned with the peer\ngroup bonus practices) such that 60% of the total target\n29\nTable of Contents\nbonus opportunity was based on Company performance metrics and 40% was based on individual performance (as determined by\nthe Compensation Committee).\nThe Company performance metrics consisted of: (i) adjusted EBITDA based against budgeted levels and adjusted for any unusual\nevents at the Committee’s discretion, (ii) cash mine costs excluding sales related costs against budgeted levels and adjusted for\nany unusual events at the Committee’s discretion, (iii) safety compliance, and (iv) environmental compliance, each of which was\nestablished by the Compensation Committee to encourage our Named Executive Officers to stay focused on operational execution,\nbalance sheet strength and environmental and safety stewardship.\nThe following table sets forth the information regarding the Company performance metrics and actual performance for fiscal 2023.\n2023 Performance Metrics 2023 Performance\nAggregate\nThreshold Target Maximum Target\nPayout Payout Payout Payout as Bonus\nPerformance Goal Weighting (50%) (100%) (200%) Performance % of Target % Earned\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) 25% $206 $258 $310 $186 0% 0%\nCost of Coal Sales\nper Ton Sold(2) 15% $91 $85 $79 $94 0% 0%\nSafety – TRIR(3) 10% 3.9 3.6 3.2 2.3 200% 20.0%\nEnvironmental(4) 10% 29 22 19 20 161% 16.1%\nTotal 60% 36.1%\n(1) Threshold, Target, and Maximum Adjusted EBTIDA goals were established by the Compensation Committee based on budgeted Adjusted EBITDA as of\nDecember of 2022. We believe adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance. We defined\nAdjusted EBITDA for this purpose as EBTIDA of $167.8M (net income ($82.3M), plus depreciation, depletion, and amortization ($54.3M), net interest\nexpense ($8.9M), and income tax expense ($22.3M)), adjusted for stock-based compensation ($12.9M), accretion of asset retirement obligations\n($1.4M) and idle mine costs ($4.0M).\n(2) Threshold, Target and Maximum Cost of Coal Sales per Ton Sold goals were established by the Compensation Committee based on budgeted Cost of\nCoal Sales per Ton Sold as of December of 2022. We believe this metric provides investors with useful information to enable them to compare our cash\ncost per ton against a similar measurement made by other publicly traded coal companies and more effectively monitor changes in coal cost from period\nto period, excluding the impact of transportation costs which are beyond our control. Cost of Coal Sales per Ton Sold for fiscal year 2023 was $94, and\nwas calculated as follows: net cash cost of sales of $309.8M (calculated as cost of sales (company produced) ($469.0M) excluding (i) transportation\ncosts ($101.6M), (ii) sale-related costs ($49.8M), (iii) idle mine costs ($4.0M), and (iv) costs related to Wyoming initiatives ($3.8)), divided by tons sold of\n3.3M.\n(3) Total Recordable Incident Rate (\"TRIR”) is a standard established by the Mine Safety and Health Administration and is widely used by coal companies to\njudge their safety performance. It is calculated as the sum of Non-Fatal Days Lost rate and No Day Lost rate. Threshold, Target, and Maximum TRIR\ngoals were established by the Compensation Committee based on the average TRIR for 2020, 2021, and 2022.\n(4) Environmental Compliance is measured by the total number of water quality exceedances, excluding selenium (\"Net Exceedances”). Threshold, Target,\nand Maximum Net Exceedances goals were established by the Compensation Committee based on the average Net Exceedance for 2020, 2021, and\n2022.\nFollowing the end of the year, the Compensation Committee reviewed the individual performance of the executives and determined\nthe individual performance payout.\n30\nTable of Contents\nBased on corporate and individual performance, the total annual bonus payout for fiscal year 2023 was as follows:\nTotal\nFiscal\nYear\nTotal 2023\nFiscal Year Annual\n2023 Bonus\nAnnual Payout\nBonus as % of\nNamed Executive Officer Payout Target\nRandall W. Atkins $2,000,000 111%\nJeremy R. Sussman $951,600 104%\nChristopher L. Blanchard $869,250 95%\nJason T. Fannin $951,600 104%\nJohn C. Marcum $742,500 90%\nLong-Term Equity-Based Compensation\nWe believe that equity-based compensation is an important component of our executive compensation program and that providing a\nsignificant portion of our executive officers’ total compensation package in equity-based compensation aligns the incentives of our\nexecutives with the interests of our shareholders and with our long-term corporate success. Additionally, we believe that equity-\nbased compensation awards enable us to attract, motivate, retain and adequately compensate executive talent.\nHistorically, the Compensation Committee has generally awarded time-based restricted stock awards to its executives. As part of\nits enhancements to the structure of the compensation program and to more closely align with peer group members, the\nCompensation Committee determined to award performance-based equity awards as well, and made awards in fiscal year 2023 to\neach of our Named Executive Officers in the form of time-based restricted stock units (\"RSUs”) and PSUs granted under the\nRamaco Resources, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended (the \"LTIP”). We believe such equity awards provide executives\nwith a significant long-term interest in our success by rewarding the creation of shareholder value over time.\nOn February 20, 2023, the Compensation Committee granted RSUs and PSUs to each of our Named Executive Officers under the\nLTIP, as follows:\nRSUs(1) PSUs\nGrant\nGrant Date Date Fair\nNamed Executive Officer # Shares Fair Value(2) # Shares Value(3)(4)\nRandall W. Atkins 144,704 $1,535,309 144,704 $2,617,695\nJeremy R. Sussman 65,631 $696,345 65,631 $1,187,265\nChristopher L. Blanchard 65,631 $696,345 65,631 $1,187,265\nJason T.

Marcum 54,870 $582,171 54,870 $992,598\n(1) The RSUs vest in one-third increments on January 31, 2024, January 31, 2025, and January 31, 2026, subject to continued employment through each\nsuch vesting date.\n(2) The grant date fair value is based on the $10.61 closing share price on the February 20, 2023 grant date.\n(3) The grant date fair value of $18.09 per share on the February 20, 2023 grant date is valued relative to the stock price performance of the 2023 peer\ngroup companies, based on a Monte Carlo simulation.\n31\nTable of Contents\n(4) Does not include incremental value of $1,095,869 associated with the 2023 modification of PSUs originally granted in 2022 related to changes in the\ncomposition of the peer group as well as changes in the way relative total shareholder return is evaluated against the updated peer group (Atkins\n$442,595; Sussman $207,137; Blanchard $207,137; Fannin $177,037; and Marcum $61,963).\n(5) Class B common stock awards were distributed to existing holders of stock-based awards on June 21, 2023 through a stock dividend. NEOs are\nentitled to 0.2 shares of Class B common stock for every share of Class A common stock that ultimately vests under the awards’ terms and conditions.\nNo incremental value occurred under ASC 718. Class B common stock awards are not shown above. Please refer to \"Outstanding Equity Awards at\n2023 Fiscal Year-End” and \"Options Exercised and Stock Vested in the 2023 Fiscal Year” tables later in this Proxy Statement for more information.\nThe PSUs will vest and be earned, if at all, based on the Company’s total shareholder return (\"TSR”) measured against our\ncompensation peer group, as listed previously, over the three-year performance period from January 1, 2023 through December 31,\n2025. The number of PSUs that vest at the end of such performance period will be determined based on the Company’s TSR\nrelative to the TSR of the members of the peer group, with 0% of the PSUs vesting at below threshold achievement (less than the\n25th percentile), 50% of the PSUs vesting at threshold achievement (25th percentile), 100% of the PSUs vesting at target\nachievement (50th percentile), and 200% of the PSUs vesting at maximum achievement (75th percentile or greater), with linear\ninterpolation applied between the 25th and 75th percentiles.\nOther Executive Benefits and Perquisites\nWe provide the following benefits to our Named Executive Officers on the same basis as other eligible employees:\n● health insurance;\n● vacation, personal holidays and sick days;\n● life insurance and supplemental life insurance;\n● short-term and long-term disability; and\n● a 401(k) plan with matching contributions.\nWe believe these benefits are generally consistent with those offered by other companies and specifically with those companies\nwith which we compete for employees.\nSeverance and Change in Control Benefits\nWe believe that a strong, experienced management team is essential to the best interests of the Company and our shareholders.\nWe recognize that the possibility of a change in control could arise and that such a possibility could result in the departure or\ndistraction of members of the management team to the detriment of the Company and our shareholders. We have adopted the\nRamaco Resources, Inc. Change in Control and Severance Plan (the \"Severance Plan”), which provides severance benefits to our\nNamed Executive Officers who enter into participation agreements under the Severance Plan, and who are not parties to any\nseparate individual agreement providing for severance benefits upon a termination of employment or change in control benefits\n(other than as provided in an equity award agreement). These benefits are enumerated and quantified in the section captioned\n\"Potential Payments Upon Termination or a Change in Control.” The Company has not entered into employment agreements with\nany of its Named Executive Officers. We do not provide for excise tax gross-ups to our executive officers and do not expect to do\nso in the future.\nRecoupment (Clawback) Policy\nWe adopted the Ramaco Dodd-Frank Restatement Recoupment Policy effective as of October 2, 2023. In the event that we are\nrequired to prepare a financial restatement, the Committee will recoup all erroneously\n32\nTable of Contents\nawarded incentive-based compensation calculated on a pre-tax basis received after October 2, 2023, by a person (i) after beginning\nservice as an executive officer, (ii) who served as an executive officer at any time during the performance period for that incentive-\nbased compensation, and (iii) during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that the Company is required\nto prepare a Restatement, and any transition period (that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year) of less than nine\nmonths within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years.\nWe believe that the adoption of a \"clawback” or recoupment policy in our executive compensation program contributes to creating\nand maintaining a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability and reinforces the performance-based principles underlying\nour executive compensation program.\nSection 162(m) Compliance\nSection 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits us to a deduction for federal income tax purposes of no more than $1 million of\ncompensation paid to certain executive officers in a taxable year. The Compensation Committee considers the impact of Section\n162(m) when making compensation decisions.\nSection 409A Considerations\nAnother section of the Code, Section 409A, affects the manner by which deferred compensation opportunities are offered to our\nemployees because Section 409A requires, among other things, that \"non-qualified deferred compensation” be structured in a\nmanner that limits employees’ abilities to accelerate or further defer certain kinds of deferred compensation. We intend to operate\nour existing compensation arrangements that are covered by Section 409A in accordance with the applicable rules thereunder, and\nwe will continue to review and amend our compensation arrangements where necessary to comply with Section 409A.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nWe follow Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, or ASC 718, for our equity-based\ncompensation awards. ASC 718 requires companies to calculate the grant date \"fair value” of their equity-based awards using a\nvariety of assumptions. ASC 718 also requires companies to recognize the compensation cost of their equity-based awards in their\nincome statements over the period that an associate is required to render service in exchange for the award. Future grants of stock\noptions, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other equity-based awards under our equity incentive award plans will be\naccounted for under ASC 718. The Compensation Committee regularly considers the accounting implications of significant\ncompensation decisions, especially in connection with decisions that relate to our equity incentive award plans and programs. As\naccounting standards change, we may revise certain programs to appropriately align accounting expenses of our equity awards\nwith our overall executive compensation philosophy and objectives.\nShareholder Say-on-Frequency and Say-on-Pay Advisory Vote\nAt our annual meeting of shareholders held on June 27, 2023, our shareholders voted to adopt the recommendation of our Board to\nhold an advisory vote to approve the compensation of our Named Executive Officers at our annual meeting of shareholders every\none year. It is anticipated that the next advisory vote to determine the frequency of future advisory votes to approve the\ncompensation of our Named Executive Officers will be presented at our annual meeting of shareholders in 2029.\nPursuant to the \"Say-on-Pay Proposal” included in this Proxy Statement, our shareholders will be voting on an advisory basis to\napprove the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. We will consider the outcome of the say-on-pay vote when making\ncompensation decisions regarding our Named Executive Officers.\n33\nTable of Contents\nRisk Assessment\nThe Company has determined that any risks arising from its compensation programs and policies are not reasonably likely to have\na material adverse effect on the Company. The Company’s compensation programs and policies mitigate risk by combining\nperformance-based, long-term compensation elements with payouts that are highly correlated to the value delivered to\nshareholders. The combination of performance measures and maximum payout levels for annual bonuses and the equity\ncompensation programs, as well as the multiyear vesting schedules for equity awards encourage employees to maintain both a\nshort and a long-term view with respect to Company performance.\nCompensation Committee Report\nThe Compensation Committee of the Board has reviewed and discussed with management the compensation discussion and\nanalysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K. Based on the review and discussions, the Compensation Committee\nrecommended to the Board that the compensation discussion and analysis be included in this Proxy Statement.\nMembers of the Compensation Committee during fiscal year 2023 were:\n● Patrick C. Graney, III (Chairperson);\n● David E. K. Frischkorn, Jr.; and\n● Richard M. Whiting.\nSummary Compensation Table for 2023\nThe following table sets forth certain information with respect to compensation for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023,\nDecember 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 earned by, awarded to or paid to our Named Executive Officers.\nStock Non-Equity Incentive All Other\nName and Principal Salary Bonus(1) Awards(2) Plan Compensation(3) Compensation(4) Total\nPosition Year ($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($)\nRandall W.

Severance benefits are determined based on\nwhether the qualifying termination of employment occurs during the period beginning 90 days before and ending 24 months after the\ndate of a change in control (as such term is defined in the Severance Plan, the \"protected period”). Change in control under the\nSeverance Plan is defined as a \"change in control event” within the meaning of Treasury Regulations 1.409A-3(i)(5)(i). All of our\nNamed Executive Officers participated in the Severance Plan in fiscal year 2023, including Mr. Marcum who participated in the\nSeverance Plan starting February 20, 2023.\nIf a participating Named Executive Officer is terminated without \"cause” (as such term is defined in the Severance Plan) by us at a\ntime other than within the protected period, the participant will be entitled to receive:\n● a lump sum cash severance payment equal to (i) the sum of (A) the participant’s annual base salary rate plus (B) the\ngreater of (x) such participant’s target bonus under our annual bonus plan for the year of termination and (y) the average\nannual bonus paid to such participant for the past three calendar years preceding the year of termination, multiplied by (ii)\n2.0 (the \"Severance Multiple”) (such payment, the \"Non-CiC Severance Payment”);\n● a lump sum cash payment equal to a prorated portion of the participant’s target bonus for the year in which the termination\noccurs (such payment, the \"Prorated Target Bonus Payment”);\n● accelerated vesting of time-based equity or equity-based awards;\n38\nTable of Contents\n● subject to the participant’s election, continued medical, dental and vision coverage under COBRA at a monthly premium\ncost to the participant that is no greater than the cost paid by the participant immediately prior to his or her termination, for\na period of up to 18 months; and\n● a lump sum cash payment equal to the employer matching contribution that would be made by us under the terms of our\n401(k) plan as if the participant had elected to contribute the maximum amount allowable into our 401(k) plan over a period\nof 24 months (such payment, the \"401(k) Payment”).\nIn addition, if a participant is terminated involuntarily by us without cause during the protected period, or the participant resigns his\nor her employment for \"good reason” (as such term is defined in the Severance Plan) during the protected period (each, a\n\"Qualifying Termination”), then the participant will be entitled to receive the same severance benefits summarized above, except\nthat the Severance Multiple used to calculate the lump sum cash severance payment increases to 2.5 (such payment, the \"CiC\nSeverance Payment”).\nBenefits under the Severance Plan are subject to the participant’s execution of an effective release of claims and compliance with\ncertain restrictive covenants, including non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions that apply for 12 months after termination.\nOur LTIP provides that in the event of a \"change in control” (as such term is defined in the LTIP) or other changes in us or our\nCommon Stock, the Board may, in its discretion, (i) accelerate the time of exercisability of an award, (ii) require awards to be\nsurrendered in exchange for a cash payment (including canceling a stock option or stock appreciation right for no consideration if it\nhas an exercise price or grant price less than the value paid in the transaction), (iii) cancel awards that remain subject to a\nrestricted period as of the date of the change in control or other event without payment or (iv) make any other adjustments to\nawards that the Board deems appropriate to reflect the applicable transaction or event.\n2023 RSU and PSU Awards\nPursuant to the terms of the 2023 RSU awards granted to each of our Named Executive Officers, in the event the applicable Named\nExecutive Officer is a participant in the Severance Plan and incurs a Qualifying Termination, any unvested RSUs held by the\nNamed Executive Officer as of such termination date will immediately accelerate and vest.\nPursuant to the terms of the 2023 PSU awards granted to each of our Named Executive Officers, in the event a \"change in control”\n(as such term is defined in the LTIP) occurs during the performance period and the applicable Named Executive Officer is employed\nas of the closing date of such change in control, any unvested PSUs held by the Named Executive Officer as of such date will\nautomatically be deemed to have vested based on maximum achievement of performance and will be settled within five business\ndays after the end of the performance period, subject to continued employment through the end of the performance period.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Named Executive Officer is a participant in the Severance Plan and incurs a\nQualifying Termination, any unvested PSUs held by the Named Executive Officer as of such termination date will be treated as\ntime-based equity awards under the Severance Plan and will immediately accelerate and vest (based on maximum achievement of\nperformance).\n39\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides information regarding potential payments to certain of our Named Executive Officers as of December\n31, 2023 in connection with certain termination or change in control events.\nTermination by the Change in Control\nCompany Without Qualifying (Without a\nBenefits and Payments Upon Cause Termination Qualifying\nTermination(1) ($) ($) Termination) ($)\nRandall W.

For 2020, the value includes the change in fair value of restricted stock awards granted in January\n2018 and January 2019 with vesting dates of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2022, respectively. Restricted stock and RSUs were valued using the\napplicable year-end closing stock price, and PSUs were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation.\nc. For 2023, the value is related entirely to the vesting of Class B common stock awards that were distributed on June 21, 2023 as part of the\nCompany’s equity restructuring. The fair value is based on the closing stock price for Class B common stock on the June 30, 2023 and December\n15, 2023 vesting dates. For 2022, the value is related to RSUs that were granted in February 2022 and vested at year-end 2022. The fair value is\nbased on the closing stock price on the vesting date.\nd. For 2023, the value includes the change in fair value of 441,176 restricted shares of Class A common stock granted in February 2020 that vested\non June 30, 2023 and 30,864 of Class A RSUs granted in February 2022 that vested on December 15, 2023.

The Audit Committee discussed and reviewed with the independent auditor\nall communications and other matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB and the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (\"SEC”), including those described in PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 16, as amended (Communication\nwith Audit Committees).\nThe Audit Committee established a practice to meet at least once per year with the Compensation Committee and the\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety Committee, currently charged with oversight of management’s response to the risks related to\nthe Coronavirus and cybersecurity, to review the material issues before these Committees and the practices of the Committees in\nresponding thereto, particularly as they relate to enterprise risk.\nManagement has the responsibility for the preparation of Ramaco Resources’ financial statements and for its internal controls and\nhas represented to the Audit Committee that the financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles. The independent auditor has the responsibility for the examination of those statements and the related audit\nof internal control over financial reporting.

The Audit\nCommittee has not appointed an independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2024, because it\nis currently engaged in a competitive proposal process to make such appointment and, therefore, does not propose that our\nshareholders ratify the appointment of any independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2024, at\nthe Annual Meeting. Bekaert continues to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm and is included in the\nproposal process. The Audit Committee expects to complete its review by June 30, 2024.\nWe intend, however, to submit proposals regarding the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public\naccounting firm to our shareholders at future annual meetings. Should our shareholders not ratify the appointment of our\nindependent registered public accounting firm in future years, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment. In making its\ndetermination regarding whether to appoint or retain a particular independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee\ntakes into account the views of management, and will take into account the vote of our shareholders with respect to the ratification\nof the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm.\nChanges in Independent Public Accountants\nOn January 1, 2022, the partners and professional staff of Briggs & Veselka Co.

However, as\nthis is an advisory vote, the results will not be binding on the Company, the board or the compensation committee, and will not\nrequire us to take any action. The final decision on the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers remains with\nCompensation Committee and the Board, although the Compensation Committee and the Board will consider the outcome of this\nvote when making compensation decisions.\nRecommendation.\nThe Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our named\nexecutive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement.\n54\nTable of Contents\nITEM 3: ADVISORY VOTE ON SIMPLE MAJORITY\nVOTING\nJohn Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, California 90278, as the representative of Kenneth Steiner, 14\nStoner Avenue, 2M, Great Neck, New York 11021-2100, the owner of the requisite number of shares of the Company’s stock, has\nsubmitted and intends to present the following proposal for consideration at the Annual Meeting. We are not responsible for the\naccuracy or content of the proposal, which is presented as received from the proponent in accordance with SEC rules. If properly\npresented at the Annual Meeting by or on behalf of the proponent, the Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST this\nproposal for the reasons set forth in the Board of Director’s Statement in Opposition, which directly follows the proposal.\nProposal 3 - Simple Majority Vote\nShareholders request that our board take each step necessary so that each voting requirement in our\ncharter and bylaws (that is explicit or implicit due to default to state law) that calls for a greater than\nsimple majority vote be replaced by a requirement for a majority of the votes cast for and against\napplicable proposals, or a simple majority in compliance with applicable laws. If necessary this\nmeans the closest standard to a majority of the votes cast for and against such proposals consistent\nwith applicable laws. This includes making the necessary changes in plain English.\nShareholders are willing to pay a premium for shares of companies that have excellent corporate\ngovernance. Supermajority voting requirements have been found to be one of 6 entrenching\nmechanisms that are negatively related to company performance according to \"What Matters in\nCorporate Governance\" by Lucien Bebchuk, Alma Cohen and Allen Ferrell of the Harvard Law School.\nSupermajority requirements are used to block initiatives supported by most shareowners but opposed\nby a status quo management.\nThis proposal topic won from 74% to 88% support at Weyerhaeuser, Alcoa, Waste Management,\nGoldman Sachs, FirstEnergy, McGraw-Hill and Macy's. These votes would have been higher than\n74% to 88% if more shareholders had access to independent proxy voting advice. This proposal topic\nalso received overwhelming 98%-support each at the 2023 annual meetings of American Airlines\n(AAL) and The Carlyle Group (CG).\nThe overwhelming shareholder support for this proposal topic at hundreds of major companies raises\nthe question of why Ramaco Resources had not initiated this proposal topic earlier.\nPlease vote yes:\n55\nTable of Contents\nProposal 3 - Simple Majority Vote\nBoard of Director’s Statement in Opposition:\nThe Board of Directors opposes Proposal 3. The Company’s Governing Documents Requiring Higher Voting Thresholds\nin a Limited Number of Circumstances and Are Narrowly Tailored To Protect Shareholders. The proposal would require\nthe Board of Directors to take steps to revise all provisions that currently require more than a majority vote to a\nmajority-only vote, as more particularly disclosed in this proxy statement.\nThe Company is asking shareholders to vote against, in a non-binding advisory vote, the proposal that our Board of Directors take\neach step necessary to modify each voting requirement in our charter and bylaws that currently require more than a majority vote to\na majority-only vote, as more particularly disclosed in this proxy statement. The Board of Directors believes that the limited\ninstances requiring higher voting thresholds in the Company’s governing documents ultimately serve to protect shareholder\ninterests, as outlined below.\nDelaware law permits companies to adopt supermajority voting requirements, requirements that many publicly traded companies\nhave implemented to preserve and enhance long-term shareholder value. Supermajority voting requirements on key corporate\nmatters serve as a safeguard against potentially self-interested actions proposed by one or a few large shareholders, who might\nattempt to prioritize their interests over those of the majority of the Company’s shareholders.\nThe affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the\nmatter is the voting standard for nearly all matters voted upon by the Company’s shareholders. Use of a supermajority voting\nstandard is limited in the Company’s governing documents to the following circumstances:\n● Removal of directors for cause, which requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the voting power of the\noutstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon (Bylaws §3.10(B); Articles of Incorporation §5.3(B))\n● Amendments to the bylaws, which requires the affirmative vote of holders of not less than 66⅔% in voting power of the\nthen-outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon (Bylaws §8.1; Articles of Incorporation §8.1)\n● Amendments to the articles of incorporation, which requires the affirmative vote of holders of not less than 66⅔% in voting\npower of the then-outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon (Articles of Incorporation §12.1(C))\nThe Board of Directors believes that higher voting requirements are appropriate in limited circumstances because certain\nfundamental matters should require broad support and consensus from the Company’s shareholders. If a simple majority voting\nstandard was adopted, as proposed, holders of a significant minority of the Company’s outstanding shares could approve certain\nfundamental corporate changes without broad shareholder support. For example, a mere majority of the votes cast at a meeting\ncould, in certain cases, represent significantly less than a majority of the Company’s outstanding shares.\nThe Existing Provisions Benefit the Company’s Shareholders.\nIf the proposal to lower the voting threshold in all cases to a simple majority voting standard were implemented, the Company’s\ngoverning documents could be amended, or directors removed for cause, by vote of less than\n56\nTable of Contents\nhalf of the Company’s outstanding shares, in cases of low voter turnout or significant abstentions. For example, if a simple majority\nvoting standard were adopted and only a small percentage of the shares outstanding were present at a meeting, then a minority of\noutstanding shares could approve significant corporate changes. This could potentially diminish the influence of every shareholder’s\nvote in key Company’s decisions.\nThe Board of Directors believes that, rather than enhancing the rights of shareholders, eliminating the higher voting thresholds could\nallow a small group of large shareholders to have greater influence on the Company’s corporate structure, governance, and future\nstrategic direction. The current voting standards ensures that all shareholders have a meaningful voice in the Company’s pivotal\ndecisions, while assuring a certain level of corporate stability. Requiring a broad consensus among shareholders prevents a small\ngroup of large shareholders from dominating the decision-making process, thereby promoting greater involvement from all\nshareholders.\nRecommendation.\nIn conclusion, after careful consideration, the Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST, on an advisory basis,\nthe proposal that the Board of Directors take each step necessary to lower each voting requirement in our charter and\nbylaws that currently requires more than a majority vote to a majority-only vote, as more particularly disclosed in this\nproxy statement.\nPlease note that this is only an advisory vote, the results will not be binding on the Company or the Board of Directors. The final\ndecision regarding this proposal remains with the Board of Directors, although the Board of Directors will consider the outcome of\nthis vote when making its decision. Shareholders should also note that approval of this proposal would not, by itself, implement a\nsimple majority voting standard as described in the proposal, and the Board of Directors and the Company’s shareholders would\nneed to take subsequent action to amend the Company’s governing documents.\n57\nTable of Contents\nGENERAL INFORMATION\nIn accordance with the SEC’s \"notice and access” model, we are providing our Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders, Proxy\nStatement and Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 to you online with paper copies available, free\nof charge, upon request.\nOn or about April 29, 2024, we will begin mailing a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials detailing how to access the\nproxy materials electronically and how to submit your proxy via the Internet.

All statements, other than statements of\nhistorical fact included in this report, regarding our strategy, future operations, financial position, estimated revenue and losses, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of\nmanagement are forward-looking statements. When used in this Annual Report, the words \"could,” \"believe,” \"anticipate,” \"intend,” \"estimate,” \"expect,” \"project” and similar\nexpressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. These forward-looking statements are\nbased on management’s current expectations and assumptions about future events and are based on currently available information as to the outcome and timing of future events.\nWhen considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the heading \"Risk Factors” included in this\nreport Annual Report.\nForward-looking statements may include statements about:\n● anticipated production levels, costs, sales volumes and revenue;\n● timing and ability to complete major capital projects;\n● economic conditions in the metallurgical coal and steel industries;\n● expected costs to develop planned and future mining operations, including the costs to construct necessary processing, refuse disposal and transport facilities;\n● estimated quantities or quality of our metallurgical coal reserves;\n● our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if required, to complete the acquisition of additional metallurgical coal reserves as currently contemplated or\nto fund the operations and growth of our business;\n● maintenance, operating or other expenses or changes in the timing thereof;\n● the financial condition and liquidity of our customers;\n● competition in coal markets;\n● the price of metallurgical coal or thermal coal;\n● compliance with stringent domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including environmental, climate change and health and safety regulations, and permitting\nrequirements, as well as changes in the regulatory environment, the adoption of new or revised laws, regulations and permitting requirements;\n● potential legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries against us;\n● the impact of weather and natural disasters on demand, production and transportation;\n● purchases by major customers and our ability to renew sales contracts;\n● credit and performance risks associated with customers, suppliers, contract miners, co-shippers and traders, banks and other financial counterparties;\n● geologic, equipment, permitting, site access and operational risks and new technologies related to mining;\n● transportation availability, performance and costs;\n● availability, timing of delivery and costs of key supplies, capital equipment or commodities such as diesel fuel, steel, explosives and tires;\n● timely review and approval of permits, permit renewals, extensions and amendments by regulatory authorities;\n● our ability to comply with certain debt covenants;\n● tax payments to be paid for the current fiscal year;\n● our expectations relating to dividend payments and our ability to make such payments;\n● the anticipated benefits and impacts of previous acquisitions;\n● risks related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the international community’s response;\n● risks related to weakened global economic conditions and inflation;\n● risks related to the impact of the novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19”) global pandemic, such as the scope and duration of the outbreak, the health and safety of our\nemployees, government actions and restrictive measures implemented in response, delays and cancellations of customer sales, supply chain disruptions and other\nimpacts to the business, or our ability to execute our business continuity plans;\n3\nTable of Contents\n● risks related to the Company’s tracking stock structure and separate performance of its Carbon Ore-Rare Earth (\"CORE”) assets; and\n● other risks identified in this Annual Report that are not historical.\nWe caution you that these forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which are difficult to predict and many of which are\nbeyond our control, incident to the development, production, gathering and sale of coal.

Business\nRamaco Resources, Inc. is a Delaware corporation formed in October 2016. Our Class A and Class B common stock are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under\nthe symbols \"METC” and \"METCB,” respectively. Our 9.00% Senior Notes due 2026 (the \"Senior Notes”) are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol\n\"METCL”. Our principal corporate offices are located in Lexington, Kentucky. As used herein, \"Ramaco Resources,” \"Ramaco,” \"the Company,” \"we,” \"us,” or \"our,” and similar\nterms include Ramaco Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.\nGeneral\nWe are an operator and developer of high-quality, low-cost metallurgical coal in southern West Virginia and southwestern Virginia. We are a pure play metallurgical coal\ncompany with 59 million reserve tons and 1,119 million measured and indicated resource tons of high-quality metallurgical coal. We believe our advantaged reserve geology provides\nus with higher productivity and industry-leading lower cash costs.\nOur development portfolio primarily includes the following properties: Elk Creek, Berwind, Knox Creek, and Maben. We believe each of these properties possesses geologic\nand logistical advantages that make our coal among the lowest delivered-cost U.S. metallurgical coal to our domestic target customer base, North American blast furnace steel mills\nand coke plants, as well as international metallurgical coal consumers. We also control mineral deposits near Sheridan, Wyoming as part of the Company’s initiatives regarding the\npotential recovery of rare earth elements as well as the potential commercialization of coal-to-carbon-based products and materials.\nOur operations include six active mines at our Elk Creek mining complex (the \"Elk Creek Complex”), three active mines at our Berwind mining complex (the \"Berwind\nComplex”), two active mines at our Knox Creek mining complex (the \"Knox Creek Complex”), and one active mine at our Maben mining complex (the \"Maben Complex”).\n4\nTable of Contents\nDevelopment of the Elk Creek Complex commenced in 2016 and included the construction of a preparation plant and rail load-out facilities. The Elk Creek property consists of\napproximately 20,200 acres of controlled mineral rights and contains approximately 16 seams that we have targeted for production. Expansion of the Elk Creek preparation plant\noccurred during 2022 and 2023 in order to increase production.\nDevelopment of the Berwind Complex began in late 2017. In 2020, we suspended development at the Berwind Complex due to lower pricing and demand largely caused by the\nCOVID-19 outbreak. In early-2021, as pricing and demand improved, Berwind development was restarted. We successfully reached the thicker Pocahontas No. 4 seam in late 2021.\nThe Berwind property consists of approximately 62,500 acres of controlled mineral rights, including the December 2021 acquisition of \"Amonate Assets” from subsidiaries of\nCoronado Global Resources Inc. (\"Coronado”) in 2021. The Amonate Assets include a processing plant located in our Berwind Complex, saving us transportation costs to our Knox\nCreek plant 26 miles away. The Berwind Complex experienced an ignition event in 2022 that resulted in idling mining operations for one of the active mines. Production restarted for\nthe idle mine in the first quarter of 2023.\nOur Knox Creek Complex includes a preparation plant and 64,050 acres of controlled mineral rights that we expect to develop in the future. The Knox Creek preparation plant\nprocessed some coal from our Berwind Complex in 2023 as well as coal purchased from third parties.\nThe Maben Coal acquisition in 2022 provides the Company with 28,000 leased acres of controlled mineral rights, which includes coal deposits that may be mined currently by\nsurface and high wall mining methods as well as developed in the future through deep mining.\nOur RAM Mine property is located in southwestern Pennsylvania. Following years of delays, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection issued a denial of\nthe RAM Mine permit. While the Company believes that the RAM permit was denied incorrectly and capriciously, we will not appeal the denial of the permit and will instead focus on\nour other core properties and monetize these assets at the appropriate time.\nOur Brook Mine property consists of approximately 16,000 acres of controlled mineral rights and a research and development facility that were acquired as part of the\npurchase of Ramaco Coal in 2022. The mine is currently undergoing mineral analysis and core drilling assessment to assess the potential concentrations of rare earth elements.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our estimated aggregate annual production capacity is just under four million clean tons of coal. We plan to complete development of our existing\nproperties and increase annual production over the next few years to approximately seven million clean tons of metallurgical coal annually, subject to market conditions, permitting,\nand additional capital deployment. We may also acquire additional reserves or infrastructure that contribute to our focus on advantaged geology and lower costs.\nMetallurgical Coal Industry\nMetallurgical coal, also known as \"met coal \" or \"coking coal,” is a key component of the blast furnace steelmaking process and, therefore, demand for such coal is highly\ncorrelated with conditions in the steel industry. The metallurgical coal global market has grown steadily in recent years and is expected to continue to do so over the next few years.\nUnited States metallurgical coal mines are primarily located in the Appalachian area of the eastern U.S. Imported metallurgical coal has historically been uneconomic due to\ntransportation costs and availability of domestic supply. Metallurgical coal is transported to domestic customers by truck, rail, barge and vessel. Metallurgical coal contracts in North\nAmerica are typically 12-month, calendar year contracts where both prices and volumes are fixed. These contracts are normally negotiated and entered into during the third and fourth\nquarters of the preceding calendar year.\nU.S. metallurgical coal is also exported to the seaborne market and sold to buyers in Europe, South America, Africa, and Asia. U.S. metallurgical coal exports are primarily\nsold to buyers in the Atlantic Basin market (customers in Europe, Brazil and Africa), and serve as swing supply to buyers in the Pacific Basin (customers in India, South Korea,\n5\nTable of Contents\nJapan and China). U.S. metallurgical coal exports compete with Australian metallurgical coals that are generally produced at a lower cost but are geographically disadvantaged to the\nAtlantic Basin. Conversely, Australian production has a much shorter logistical route to Pacific Basin customers. Any supply shortfall out of Australia, or increase in global demand\nbeyond Australia’s capacity, has historically been serviced by U.S. and Canadian metallurgical coal producers.\nExport metallurgical coal pricing is determined utilizing a series of indices from a number of independent sources and is adjusted for coal quality. Contracted export volumes\nhave terms that vary in duration from spot cargoes to one year, rarely exceeding one year. In some cases, indices are used to calculate pricing at the point that the coal changes\nhands. In other cases, an average value of indices over time may be utilized. While the term \"benchmark” is still utilized, it too is determined based on index values, typically for the\npreceding three months.\nMetallurgical coals are generally classified as high, medium or low-volatile (\"vol”). Volatiles are products, other than water, that are released as gas or vapor when coal is\nconverted to coke. Carbon is the primary element that remains when the volatiles are released.\nOur Strategy\nOur business strategy is to increase stockholder value through sustained earnings growth, cash flow generation and dividends by:\nDeveloping and Operating Our Metallurgical Coal Properties. We have 59 million reserve tons and 1,119 million measured and indicated resource tons of high-quality\nmetallurgical coal with attractive quality characteristics across high-volatility and low-volatility segments. This geologically advantaged resource and reserve base allows for flexible\ncapital spending in challenging market conditions.\nWe plan to complete development of our existing properties and increase annual production over the next few years to approximately seven million clean tons of\nmetallurgical coal, subject to market conditions, permitting, and additional capital deployment. We may also acquire additional reserves or infrastructure that contribute to our focus\non advantaged geology and lower costs.\nBeing a Low-Cost U.S. Producer of Metallurgical Coal. Our reserve base presents advantaged geologic characteristics such as relatively thick coal seams at the deep\nmines, a low effective mining ratio at the surface mines, and desirable metallurgical coal quality. These characteristics contribute to a production profile that has a cash cost of\nproduction that is significantly below most U.S. metallurgical coal producers.\nMaintaining a Conservative Capital Structure and Prudently Managing the Business for the Long Term. We are committed to maintaining a conservative capital structure\nwith a reasonable amount of debt that will afford us the financial flexibility to execute our business strategies on an ongoing basis.\nEnhancing Coal Purchase Opportunities. Depending on market conditions, we purchase coal from other independent producers. Purchased coal is complementary from a\nblending standpoint with our produced coals or it may also be sold as an independent product.\nDemonstrating Excellence in Safety and Environmental Stewardship. We are committed to complying with both regulatory and our high standards for environmental and\nemployee health and safety requirements. We believe that business excellence is achieved through the pursuit of safer and more productive work practices.\nAdvancing our Initiatives in Rare Earth Elements and Advanced Carbon Products. We are also focused on critical mineral rare earth development as well as the potential\ncommercialization of coal-to-carbon-based products and materials. These initiatives provide additional growth opportunities and upside potential in future periods.\n6\nTable of Contents\nOur Projects\nOur properties are primarily located in southern West Virginia, southwestern Virginia, southwestern Pennsylvania, and northeastern Wyoming. The following map shows\nthe location of our mining complexes and projects, excluding our properties located in Pennsylvania and Wyoming:\nElk Creek Mining Complex\nOur Elk Creek Complex in southern West Virginia began production in late December 2016. The Elk Creek property consists of approximately 20,200 acres of controlled\nmineral rights and contains 16 seams that we believe are economically mineable. Nearly all our seams contain high-quality, high-volatile metallurgical coal accessible at or above\ndrainage. Additionally, almost all of this coal is high-fluidity, which is an important factor for high-volatile metallurgical coal.\nWe control the majority of the coal and related mining rights within the existing permitted areas and our current mine plans, as well as the surface for our surface facilities,\nthrough lease agreements with McDonald Land Company among others. We estimate that the Elk Creek Complex contains reserves capable of yielding approximately 28 million\n7\nTable of Contents\ntons of clean saleable metallurgical coal as well as measured and indicated metallurgical coal resource tons of 215 million. We estimate that the mine life for the Elk Creek Complex is\nover 20 years.\nWe currently market most of the coal produced from the Elk Creek Complex as a blended high-volatile A/B product. When segregated, a portion of our coal can be sold as a\nhigh-volatile A product for a premium. Our market for Elk Creek production is principally North American coke and steel producers. We also market our coal to European, South\nAmerican, Asian and African customers, and occasionally to coal traders and brokers for use in filling orders for their blended products. Additionally, we seek to market a portion of\nour coal in the specialty coal markets that value low ash content.\nWe process our Elk Creek coal production through the preparation plant located on-site at the complex, which has a heavy-media vessel, large-diameter heavy-media\ncyclone, dual-stage spiral concentrators, froth flotation, horizontal vibratory and screen bowl centrifuges. Our rail load-out facilities at Elk Creek are served by the CSX railroad;\nhowever, we also have the ability to develop on controlled property a rail-loading facility on the Norfolk Southern railroad, which would facilitate dual rail service. We have not yet\ncommitted capital for the development of a Norfolk Southern rail facility.\nThe combined refuse capacity at the active disposal areas is expected to provide over 20 years of disposal life for our operations with additional refuse areas being permitted.\nWe completed construction of a full complement of plate presses during 2020 to allow for dewatering of material which then was being pumped as slurry to our impoundment. This\nequipment allows us to process all waste material for placement in areas designed for combined refuse disposal and maximize the life for disposal of fine waste rock in the pool of the\nimpoundment.\nA large portion of our controlled reserves are permitted through existing, issued permits, and we continue actively pursuing multiple new permits.\nOn January 3, 2020, we entered into a mineral lease with the McDonald Land Company for coal reserves which, in many cases, are located immediately adjacent to our Elk\nCreek Complex. This leased property became available after the former base lease with another party was terminated. The prior lessee, who controlled the property since 1978, did not\nproduce commercial amounts of coal from the property during their possession of the lease. While it is unusual to have a metallurgical reserve in this part of Central Appalachia\nremain idle for such an extended period of time, the configuration and location of the tracts lend themselves to be mined and processed far more efficiently from our Elk Creek\nproperty. The McDonald reserves have the same geologic advantages and low costs that are being experienced in our Elk Creek mines.\nDuring 2022, we began work on a throughput upgrade at our Elk Creek Preparation plant. The upgrade, which was completed in 2023, increased our annual processing\ncapacity for this complex to approximately three million tons per year. In order to utilize the increased capacity, we also began development work on additional low-cost, high- volatile\nmines at Elk Creek, which began production during 2022.\nBerwind Mining Complex\nOur Berwind Complex is located on the border of West Virginia and Virginia and is well-positioned to fill the anticipated market for low-volatile coals. The Berwind property\nconsists of approximately 62,500 acres of controlled mineral rights, including the Amonate acquisition. We estimate that the Berwind Complex contains reserves capable of yielding\napproximately 23 million tons of clean saleable metallurgical coal as well as measured and indicated metallurgical coal resource tons of 629 million. We estimate that the mine life for\nthe Berwind Complex is over 20 years. We view Berwind as the second flagship complex for Ramaco.\nDevelopment of our Berwind Complex began in late 2017 in the thinner Pocahontas No. 3 seam and has since sloped up to current mining in the thicker Pocahontas No. 4\nseam. In 2020, we suspended development at the Berwind Complex due to lower pricing and demand largely caused by the economic effects of COVID-19. In early 2021, as pricing and\ndemand improved, Berwind development resumed, and we successfully reached the Pocahontas No. 4 seam\n8\nTable of Contents\nin late 2021. The Berwind Complex experienced an ignition event during the third quarter of 2022 that resulted in idling mining operations for one of the active mines. Production\nrestarted for the idle mine in the first quarter of 2023.\nWe have the necessary permits for the Berwind Complex for our current and budgeted operations. A permit for our Squire Jim seam room-and-pillar underground mine was\nissued in 2020 and contains a large area of Squire Jim seam coal deposits. The Squire Jim seam of coal is the lowest known coal seam on the geologic column in this region, and due to\nthe depth of cover has never been significantly explored. At this point, we do not anticipate activating this mining permit.\nIn December 2021, we acquired the Amonate Assets from Coronado, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. The acquisition included a mine complex located in McDowell\nCounty, West Virginia and Tazewell County, Virginia adjacent and contiguous to the Company’s existing Berwind Complex. The assets primarily consist of high-quality, low and mid-\nvolatile metallurgical coal reserves and resources, much of which will be mined from the Company’s Berwind Complex. Also purchased were several additional permitted mines and an\nidled 1.3 million ton per annum capacity coal preparation plant with a rail loading facility.\nWe began mine development on the Amonate Assets shortly after acquisition, and production began in the first quarter of 2022. The preparation plant and rail loading\nfacility were refurbished in 2022 and began operation in the fourth quarter of 2022. Rail service is provided by Norfolk Southern.\nKnox Creek Mining Complex\nThe Knox Creek Complex consists of approximately 64,050 acres of controlled mineral rights as well as a preparation plant, a coal-loading facility, and a refuse impoundment.\nRail service is provided by Norfolk Southern.\nThe Tiller Mine slope face-up and shafts were idled before our acquisition of the property. The Company has spent limited amounts of capital to review the feasibility of a\nhigh-vol A metallurgical deep mine in the Jawbone seam of coal. This seam is located slightly above the Tiller Seam and would be accessed via a short slope from within the existing\nTiller seam mine. Jawbone coal could flow through the same portal and slope as the idle Tiller mine. Production is expected to resume once warranted by market conditions. We\nestimate that the Knox Complex contains reserves capable of yielding approximately 8 million tons of clean saleable metallurgical coal as well as measured and indicated metallurgical\ncoal resource tons of 275 million. We estimate that the mine life for the Knox Creek Complex is approximately 15 years.\nFrom time to time, we process coal purchased from other independent producers at the Knox Creek preparation plant and load-out facilities. We have also processed and\nloaded coal from our Berwind Complex at this facility.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, we acquired multiple permits from various affiliates of Omega Highwall Mining, LLC. These permits are in close proximity to our Knox Creek\npreparation plant and loadout infrastructure and provide immediate access to two separate mining areas in Southwestern Virginia. One is a deep mine permit in the Jawbone Seam, a\ngeologically advantaged metallurgical coal reserve and resource. The second is a metallurgical surface mine in the Tiller seam that is mined via surface and highwall mining methods.\nIn August 2021, we began production at the Big Creek surface mine. We added a highwall miner in the fourth quarter of 2021. The mine reached full production during 2023.\nRAM Mine\nFollowing years of delays, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection issued a denial of the RAM Mine permit in southwest Pennsylvania. While the\nCompany believes that the RAM permit was denied incorrectly and capriciously, we will not appeal the denial of the permit and will instead focus on our other core properties and\nmonetize these assets at the appropriate time.\n9\nTable of Contents\nMaben Complex\nThe Maben property is located in southern West Virginia and consists of approximately 28,000 acres of controlled mineral rights acquired from the purchase of Maben Coal\nin the third quarter of 2022. As part of the transaction, we assumed existing mining permits issued by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection, which authorizes\nmining by both surface and highwall mining methods as well as by underground methods. The property also has issued permits covering an existing haul road as well as an active\nrefuse disposal area together with a preparation plant and unit train loadout, neither of which had been constructed as of the closing date. In early 2024, the Company completed the\npurchase of an existing coal preparation plant, which will be relocated to the Company’s Maben Complex.\nThe Maben property contains various areas of high-quality low-vol metallurgical coal in the Sewell, Beckley, Pocahontas 3, Pocahontas 4, and Pocahontas 6 seams of coal.\nThe Company expects that coal contained in the Sewell seam will be mined by surface and high-wall mining methods. Initial production began in 2023, reaching an annualized\nproduction rate of approximately 250,000 tons of low-volatile coal. The Company will consider deep mine development of coal contained in Beckley, Pocahontas 3, 4, and 6 seams at a\nfuture point. Although the Company currently utilizes the Berwind preparation plant, such development would require the construction of a new preparation plant and loadout as\nmentioned above, which is under way.\nBrook Mine\nThe property is located in northeastern Wyoming, near Sheridan, and consists of approximately 16,000 acres of controlled mineral rights and a research and development\nfacility that were acquired as part of the purchase of Ramaco Coal during 2022. The property includes a thermal coal deposit and permit as well as occurrences of rare earth elements.\nThe mine is currently undergoing mineral analysis and core drilling assessment to assess the potential concentrations of rare earth elements. This property is being used to support\nthe Company’s possible expansion into the manufacture and commercialization of advanced carbon products and materials from coal.\nThree drillhole programs involving a total of 123 new core drillholes specifically targeting rare earth elements (REEs) have been completed within the current Brook Mine\npermit area. So far, the results of these drilling programs indicate elevated levels of REEs, along with significant concentrations of other critical elements such as Yttrium, Gallium, and\nGermanium. Work is ongoing to evaluate the potential exploitation of these minerals within the current Brook Mine permit area.\nCustomers and Contracts\nCoal prices differ substantially by region and are impacted by many factors including the overall economy, demand for steel, demand for electricity, location, market, quality\nand type of coal, mine operation costs and the cost of customer alternatives. The major factors influencing our business are the global economy and demand for steel.\nWe market the bulk of our production to North American integrated steel mills and coke plants, as well as international customers in Europe, South America, Asia and Africa.\nAdditionally, we market limited amounts of our production to various premium-priced specialty markets, such as foundry cokemakers, manufacturers of activated carbon products,\nand specialty metals producers.\nCoal quality and volumes are stipulated in coal sales agreements, and, in many cases, the annual pricing and volumes are fixed. Our contracts with customers typically\nrequire us to deliver coal with minimum specifications or qualities. Variances from these specifications or qualities are settled by employing price adjustments.\nGenerally, the Company’s domestic sales contracts have terms of about one year and the pricing is typically fixed. Export sales have spot or term contracts, and pricing can\nbe either fixed or derived against index-based pricing mechanisms.\n10\nTable of Contents\nWe sold 3.5 million tons of coal during 2023. Of this, 33% was sold to North American markets and 67% was sold into export markets, excluding Canada. Principally, our\nexport market sales were made to Europe. During 2023, sales to three customers accounted for approximately 41% of total revenue. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of\nour total revenue during 2023. If a major customer decided to stop purchasing coal or significantly reduced its purchases from us, revenue could decline and our operating results and\nfinancial condition could be adversely affected.\nTrade Names, Trademarks and Patents\nWe do not have any registered trademarks or trade names for our traditional products and services or subsidiaries, nor do we believe that any trademark or trade name is\nmaterial to our metallurgical coal business. The names of the seams in which we have coal reserves, and attributes thereof, are widely recognized in the metallurgical coal market.\nHowever, trademarks related to our advanced carbon products business could become material depending on future developments.\nIn connection with our advanced carbon products business, the Company holds 61 intellectual property patents and pending patents related to the conversion of low-cost\ncarbon ore into higher-value carbon products as well as exclusive licensing agreements, all of which have a remaining duration of 14-20 years.\nCompetition\nOur principal domestic competitors include Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc., Blackhawk Mining, LLC, Coronado Global Resources Inc., Arch Resources, Inc., Peabody\nEnergy Corporation and Warrior Met Coal, Inc. We also compete in international markets directly with domestic companies and with companies that produce coal from one or more\nforeign countries, such as Australia, Canada, and Colombia. Many of these coal producers are larger than we are and have greater financial resources and larger reserve bases than\nwe do.\nSuppliers\nSupplies used in our business include petroleum-based fuels, explosives, tires, conveyance structure, ventilation supplies, lubricants and other raw materials as well as spare\nparts and other consumables used in the mining process. We use third-party suppliers for a significant portion of our equipment rebuilds and repairs, drilling services and\nconstruction. We believe adequate substitute suppliers and contractors are available, and we are not dependent on any one supplier or contractor. We continually seek to develop\nrelationships with suppliers and contractors that focus on reducing our costs while improving quality and service.\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety and Other Regulatory Matters\nOur operations are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, such as those relating to permitting and licensing\nmatters, employee health and safety, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, water discharges, air emissions, plant and wildlife protection, the storage, treatment and\ndisposal of certain materials (including solid and hazardous wastes), remediation of contaminated sites, surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects of mining on\nsurface water and groundwater conditions.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations may be costly and time-consuming, delay the commencement, continuation or expansion of exploration or production at our\nfacilities, and depress demand for our products by imposing more stringent requirements and limits on our customers’ operations. Moreover, these laws are constantly evolving, and\nthe trend has been for increasingly complex and stringent regulation over time. New legislative or administrative proposals, or judicial interpretations of existing laws and regulations\nrelated to the protection of the environment could result in substantially increased capital, operating and compliance costs.\nDue in part to these extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements and ever-changing interpretations of these requirements, violations of these laws can occur from\ntime to time in our industry and also in our operations. Expenditures relating to environmental compliance are a major cost consideration for our operations and safety and\n11\nTable of Contents\ncompliance is a significant factor in mine design, both to meet regulatory requirements and to minimize long-term environmental liabilities.\nThe following is a summary of the various federal and state environmental and similar regulations that have a material impact on our business:\nSurface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (the \"SMCRA”) establishes comprehensive operational,\nreclamation and closure standards for our mining operations and requires that such standards be met during the course of and following completion of mining activities. The SMCRA\nalso stipulates compliance with many other major environmental statutes, including the Clean Air Act (the \"CAA”), the Clean Water Act (the \"CWA”), the Endangered Species Act\n(the \"ESA”), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (the \"RCRA”) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (the \"CERCLA”).\nPermits for all mining operations must be obtained from the United States Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (the \"OSMRE”) or, where state regulatory agencies\nhave adopted federally approved state programs under SMCRA, the appropriate state regulatory authority. Our operations are located in West Virginia and Virginia, which have\nachieved primary jurisdiction for enforcement of SMCRA through approved state programs.\nThe SMCRA imposes a complex set of requirements covering all facets of coal mining. SMCRA regulations govern, among other things, coal prospecting, mine plan\ndevelopment, topsoil or growth medium removal and replacement, disposal of excess spoil and coal refuse, protection of the hydrologic balance, and suitable post mining land uses.\nFrom time to time, the OSMRE will also update its mining regulations under the SMCRA. For example, the OSMRE has previously sought to impose stricter stream protection\nrequirements by requiring more extension pre-mining and baseline data for coal mining operations. The rule was disapproved by Congress pursuant to the Congressional Review Act.\nHowever, whether Congress will enact future legislation to require a new stream protection rule remains uncertain. The existing rules, or other new SMCRA regulations, could result in\nadditional material costs, obligations and restrictions upon our operations.\nAbandoned Mine Lands Fund. The SMCRA also imposes a reclamation fee on all current mining operations, the proceeds of which are deposited in the Abandoned Mine\nReclamation Fund (the \"AML Fund”), which is used to restore unreclaimed and abandoned mine lands mined before 1977. The adjusted fees proposed in the Interim Final Rule per\nton for October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2034 are (i) 22.4 cents per ton for surface-mined anthracite, bituminous, and subbituminous coal if the value per ton is $2.24 per ton or\nmore, (ii) 9.6 cents per ton for underground-mined anthracite, bituminous, and subbituminous coal if the value per ton is $0.96 per ton, and (iii) 6.4 cents per ton for surface- and\nunderground-mined lignite coal if the value per ton is $3.20 per ton or more. The Interim Final Rule took effect in August 2022. Estimates of our total reclamation and mine-closing\nliabilities are based upon permit requirements and our experience related to similar activities. If these accruals are insufficient or our liability in a particular year is greater than currently\nanticipated, our future operating results could be adversely affected.\nMining Permits and Approvals. Numerous governmental permits and approvals are required for mining operations. We are required to prepare and present to federal, state,\nand local authorities data detailing the effect or impact that any proposed exploration project for production of coal may have upon the environment, the public and our employees.\nThe permitting rules are complex and continuously updated, and may be subject to discretionary interpretations by regulators. Further, the laws, rules, and regulations that govern\nour mining operations authorize substantial fines and penalties, including revocation or suspension of mining permits under some circumstances. Monetary sanctions and, in certain\ncircumstances, even criminal sanctions may be imposed for failure to comply with these laws. Compliance with required permits and associated regulations may have a material\nadverse impact on our operations, earnings, or financial condition.\nApplications for permits and permit renewals associated with our mining operations are also subject to public comment and potential legal challenges from third parties\nseeking to prevent a permit from being issued, or to overturn the applicable agency’s grant of the permit. Should our permitting efforts become subject to such challenges, the permits\nmay not be issued in a timely fashion, may impose requirements which restrict our ability to conduct our mining\n12\nTable of Contents\noperations or to do so profitably, or may not be issued at all. Any delays, denials, or revocation of these or other similar permits we need to operate could reduce our production and\nmaterially adversely impact our cash flow and results of our operations.\nIn order to obtain mining permits and approvals from state regulatory authorities, mine operators must also submit a reclamation plan for restoring the mined property to its\nprior condition, productive use or other permitted condition. The conditions of certain permits also require that we obtain surface-owner consent if the surface estate has been split\nfrom the mineral estate. This requires us to negotiate with third parties for surface access that overlies coal we acquired or intend to acquire. These negotiations can be costly and\ntime-consuming, lasting years in some instances, which can create additional delays in the permitting process. If we cannot successfully negotiate for land access, we could be\ndenied a permit to mine coal we already own.\nFinally, we typically submit necessary mining permit applications several months, or even years, before we anticipate mining a new area. However, we cannot control the\npace at which the government issues permits needed for new or ongoing operations. For example, the process of obtaining CWA permits can be particularly time-consuming and\nsubject to delays and denials. The Environmental Protection Agency (the \"EPA”) also has the authority to veto permits issued by the U.S. Army Corps. of Engineers (the \"Corps”)\nunder the CWA’s Section 404 program that prohibits the discharge of dredged or fill material into regulated waters without a permit. Even after we obtain the permits that we need to\noperate, many of the permits must be periodically renewed, or may require modification. There is some risk that not all existing permits will be approved for renewal, or that existing\npermits will be approved for renewal only upon terms that restrict or limit our operations in ways that may be material.\nFinancial Assurance. Federal and state laws require a mine operator to secure the performance of its reclamation and lease obligations under the SMCRA through the use of\nsurety bonds or other approved forms of financial security for payment of certain long-term obligations, including mine closure or reclamation costs. The changes in the market for\ncoal used to generate electricity in recent years have led to bankruptcies involving prominent coal producers. Several of these companies relied on self-bonding to guarantee their\nresponsibilities under the SMCRA permits including for reclamation. In response to these bankruptcies, the OSMRE issued a policy advisory in August 2016 to state agencies that\nwas intended to discourage authorized states from approving self-bonding arrangements (the \"Policy Advisory”). Although the Policy Advisory was rescinded in October 2017,\ncertain states, including Virginia, had previously announced that they would no longer accept self-bonding to secure reclamation obligations under the state mining laws.\nAdditionally, in March 2018, the Government Accounting Office recommended that Congress consider amending the SMCRA to eliminate the availability of self-bonding to\nguarantee responsibilities under SMCRA permits. Individually and collectively, these and future revised various financial assurance requirements may increase the amount of\nfinancial assurance needed and limit the types of acceptable instruments, straining the capacity of the surety markets to meet demand. This may delay the timing for and increase the\ncosts of obtaining the required financial assurance.\nWe use surety bonds, trusts and letters of credit to provide financial assurance for certain transactions and business activities. Federal and state laws require us to obtain\nsurety bonds to secure payment of certain long-term obligations including mine closure or reclamation costs and other miscellaneous obligations. The bonds are renewable on\na yearly basis. Surety bond rates have increased in recent years and the market terms of such bonds have generally become less favorable. Sureties typically require coal producers to\npost collateral, often having a value equal to 40% or more of the face amount of the bond. As a result, we may be required to provide collateral, letters of credit or other assurances of\npayment in order to obtain the necessary types and amounts of financial assurance. Under our surety bonding program, we are not currently required to post any letters of credit or\nother collateral to secure the surety bonds; obtaining letters of credit in lieu of surety bonds could result in a significant cost increase. Moreover, the need to obtain letters of credit\nmay also reduce amounts that we can borrow under any senior secured credit facility for other purposes. If, in the future, we are unable to secure surety bonds for these obligations\nand are forced to secure letters of credit indefinitely or obtain some other form of financial assurance at too high of a cost, our profitability may be negatively affected.\nWe intend to maintain a credit profile that precludes the need to post collateral for our surety bonds. Nonetheless, our surety has the right to demand additional collateral at\nits discretion.\n13\nTable of Contents\nSome international customers require new suppliers to post performance guarantees during the initial stages of qualifying to become a long-term supplier. To date we have\nnot had to provide a performance guarantee, but it is possible that such a guarantee could be required in the future.\nMine Safety and Health. The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended (the \"MINE Act”) and the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of\n2006 (the \"MINER Act”), and regulations issued under these federal statutes, impose stringent health and safety standards on mining operations. The regulations that have been\nadopted under the Mine Act and the MINER Act are comprehensive and affect numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine personnel, mining procedures, roof\ncontrol, ventilation, blasting, use and maintenance of mining equipment, dust and noise control, communications, emergency response procedures, and other matters. The Mine\nSafety and Health Administration (the \"MSHA”) regularly inspects mines to ensure compliance with regulations promulgated under the Mine Act and MINER Act.\nPennsylvania, West Virginia, and Virginia all have similar programs for mine safety and health regulation and enforcement. The various requirements mandated by federal\nand state statutes, rules, and regulations place restrictions on our methods of operation and result in fees and civil penalties for violations of such requirements or criminal liability for\nthe knowing violation of such standards, significantly impacting operating costs and productivity.\nThe regulations enacted under the Mine Act and MINER Act as well as under similar state acts are routinely expanded or made more stringent, raising compliance costs and\nincreasing potential liability. Our compliance with current or future mine health and safety regulations could increase our mining costs. At this time, it is not possible to predict the full\neffect that new or proposed statutes, regulations and policies will have on our operating costs, but any expansion of existing regulations, or making such regulations more stringent,\nmay have a negative impact on the profitability of our operations. If we were to be found in violation of mine safety and health regulations, we could face penalties or restrictions that\nmay materially and adversely impact our operations, financial results and liquidity.\nIn addition, government inspectors have the authority to issue orders to shut down our operations based on safety considerations under certain circumstances, such as\nimminent dangers, accidents, failures to abate violations, and unwarrantable failures to comply with mandatory safety standards. If an incident were to occur at one of our operations,\nit could be shut down for an extended period of time, and our reputation with prospective customers could be materially damaged. Moreover, if one of our operations is issued a\nnotice of pattern of violations, then MSHA can issue an order withdrawing the miners from the area affected by any enforcement action during each subsequent significant and\nsubstantial (\"S&S”) citation until the S&S citation or order is abated.\nWorkers’ Compensation and Occupational Disease. We are insured for workers’ compensation benefits for work related injuries that occur within our United States\noperations. We retain insurance coverage for all of our subsidiaries and are insured for the statutory limits. Workers’ compensation liabilities, including those related to claims\nincurred but not reported, are recorded principally using annual valuations based on discounted future expected payments using historical data of the operating subsidiary or\ncombined insurance industry data when historical data is limited. State workers’ compensation acts typically provide for an exception to an employer’s immunity from civil lawsuits\nfor workplace injuries in the case of intentional torts. However, West Virginia’s workers’ compensation act provides a much broader exception to workers’ compensation immunity.\nThe exception allows an injured employee to recover against his or her employer where he or she can show damages caused by an unsafe working condition of which the employer\nwas aware that was a violation of a statute, regulation, rule or consensus industry standard. These types of lawsuits are not uncommon and could have a significant impact on our\noperating costs.\nIn addition, we obtained from a third-party insurer a workers’ compensation insurance policy, which includes coverage for medical and disability benefits for occupational\ndisease under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 and the Mine Act. Under the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 and the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of\n1977, as amended in 1981, each coal mine operator must pay federal black lung benefits to claimants who are current and former employees and also make payments to a trust fund for\nthe payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants who last worked in the coal industry prior to January 1, 1970.\n14\nTable of Contents\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 includes significant changes to the federal black lung program including an automatic survivor benefit paid upon the\ndeath of a miner with an awarded black lung claim and the establishment of a rebuttable presumption with regard to pneumoconiosis among miners with 15 or more years of coal mine\nemployment that are totally disabled by a respiratory condition. These changes could have a material impact on our costs expended in association with the federal black lung\nprogram. In addition to possibly incurring liability under federal statutes, we may also be liable under state laws for black lung claims.\nClean Air Act. The CAA and comparable state laws that regulate air emissions affect coal mining operations both directly and indirectly. Direct impacts on coal mining and\nprocessing operations include CAA permitting requirements and emission control requirements relating to air pollutants, including particulate matter such as fugitive dust. The CAA\nindirectly impacts coal mining operations by extensively regulating the emissions of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury and other compounds emitted by coal-\nfired power plants. In addition to the greenhouse gas (\"GHG”) issues discussed below, the air emissions programs that may materially and adversely affect our operations, financial\nresults, liquidity, and demand for our coal, directly or indirectly, include, but are not limited to, the following:\n● Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. In July 2011, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (the \"CSAPR”), a cap-and-trade program that requires 28 states in the\nMidwest and eastern seaboard of the U.S. to reduce power plant emissions that cross state lines and contribute to ozone and/or fine particle pollution in other states. In\nSeptember 2016, the EPA finalized a rule that further limited summertime (May-September) nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants in 22 states in the eastern United\nStates beginning in May 2017 (the \"CSAPR Update Rule”). For states to meet these requirements, a number of coal-fired electric generating units will likely need to be\nretired, rather than retrofitted with the necessary emission control technologies, reducing demand for thermal coal. Moreover, in September 2019, the United States Court\nof Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (\"D.C. Circuit”) remanded the CSAPR Update Rule to the EPA on the grounds that it failed to timely require upwind states\nto control or eliminate their contribution to ozone and/or fine particulate matter in downwind states, as required under the CAA. In October 2020, the EPA proposed a\nRevised CSAPR Update Rule in response to the D.C. Circuit’s ruling, which was finalized in April 2021. The final rule resolves 21 states’ outstanding interstate pollution\ntransport obligations and would require additional emissions reductions of nitrogen oxides from power plants in 12 states. Imposition of stricter deadlines for controlling\ndownwind contribution could accelerate unit retirements or the need to implement emission control strategies. Any reduction in the amount of coal consumed by electric\npower generators as a result of these limitations could decrease demand for thermal coal.\n● Acid Rain. Title IV of the CAA requires reductions of sulfur dioxide emissions by electric utilities and applies to all coal-fired power plants generating greater than 25\nmegawatts of power. Affected power plants have sought to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by switching to lower sulfur fuels, installing pollution control devices,\nreducing electricity generating levels or purchasing or trading sulfur dioxide emission allowances. These reductions could impact our customers in the electric\ngeneration industry. These requirements are not supplanted by the CSAPR.\n● NAAQS for Criterion Pollutants. The CAA requires the EPA to set standards, referred to as National Ambient Air Quality Standards (\"NAAQS”), for six common air\npollutants: carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, lead, ozone, particulate matter (\"PM”) and sulfur dioxide. Areas that are not in compliance (referred to as \"non-attainment\nareas”) with these standards must take steps to reduce emissions levels. The EPA has adopted NAAQS for carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, lead, sulfur dioxide, PM\nand ground-level ozone. The CAA further requires the EPA to periodically review and revise the NAAQS, resulting in the trend of more stringent standards over time.\nIn February 2024, for example, the EPA published a final rule that revised the primary annual PM2.5 standard by lowering the level from 12.0 µg/m3 to 9.0 µg/m3. States\nwith non-attainment areas must adopt a state implementation plan that demonstrates compliance with the existing or new air quality standards. These plans could\nrequire significant additional emissions control expenditures at coal-fired power plants. New rules and standards may also impose additional emissions control\nrequirements on our customers in the electric generation, steelmaking, and coke industries. Because\n15\nTable of Contents\ncoal mining operations emit particulate matter and sulfur dioxide, our mining operations could be affected when the new standards are implemented by the states.\n● Mercury and Hazardous Air Pollutants. The EPA has established emission standards for mercury and other metals, fine particulates, and acid gases from coal- and oil-\nfired power plants through the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (\"MATS”) rule. Like CSAPR, MATS and other similar future regulations could accelerate the\nretirement of a significant number of coal-fired power plants. Such retirements would likely adversely impact our business.\nGlobal Climate Change. Climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. There is widespread concern about the contributions of human\nactivity to such changes, especially through the emission of GHGs. Numerous reports from scientific and governmental bodies such as the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel\non Climate Change have expressed heightened concerns about the impacts of human activity, especially fossil fuel combustion, on the global climate. There are three primary sources\nof GHGs associated with the coal industry. First, the end use of our coal by our customers in electricity generation, coke plants, and steelmaking is a source of GHGs. Second,\ncombustion of fuel by equipment used in coal production and to transport our coal to our customers is a source of GHGs. Third, coal mining itself can release methane, which is\nconsidered to be a more potent GHG than carbon dioxide, directly into the atmosphere. These emissions from coal consumption, transportation and production are subject to pending\nand proposed regulation as part of initiatives to address global climate change.\nAs a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional, state and local levels of government to monitor\nand limit emissions of GHGs. Collectively, these initiatives could result in higher electric costs to our customers or lower the demand for coal used in electric or steel generation, which\ncould in turn adversely impact our business.\nAt present, we are principally focused on metallurgical coal production, which is not used in connection with the production of power generation. However, we may seek to\nsell greater amounts of our coal into the power-generation market in the future. The market for our coal may be adversely impacted if comprehensive legislation or regulations\nfocusing on GHG emission reductions are adopted, or if our customers are unable to obtain financing for their operations.\nAt the international level, in April 2016, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change in Paris, France, which resulted in an agreement intended to nationally determine their contributions and set GHG emission reduction goals every five\nyears beginning in 2020. In November 2019, plans were formally announced for the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Agreement with an effective exit date in November 2020. In\nFebruary 2021, the current administration announced reentry of the U.S. into the Paris Agreement along with a new \"nationally determined contribution” for U.S. GHG emissions that\nwould achieve emissions reductions of at least 50% relative to 2005 levels by 2030. In addition, shortly after taking office in January 2021, President Biden issued a series of executive\norders designed to address climate change. In November 2021, the 26th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change concluded with the finalization\nof the Glasgow Climate Pact, which aims to cut global methane pollution at least 30% by 2030 relative to 2020 levels, including \"all feasible reductions” in the energy sector. Forty-six\ncountries signed onto a Global Coal to Clean Energy Transition Statement, committing to transition away from unabated coal power generation by about 2030 for \"major economies”\nand a global transition by roughly 2040. Most recently, at the 27th conference of parties (\"COP27”), President Biden announced the EPA’s proposed standards to reduce methane\nemissions from existing oil and gas sources, and agreed, in conjunction with the European Union and a number of other partner countries, to develop standards for monitoring and\nreporting methane emissions to help create a market for low methane-intensity natural gas. Various state and local governments have also publicly committed to furthering the goals\nof the Paris Agreement. International commitments, reentry into the Paris Agreement and President Biden’s executive orders may result in the development of additional regulations\nor changes to existing regulations that may impact our business.\nThe $1 trillion legislative infrastructure package passed by Congress in November 2021 includes a number of climate-focused spending initiatives targeted at climate\nresilience, enhanced response and preparation for extreme\n16\nTable of Contents\nweather events, and clean energy and transportation investments. In August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 into law. The law provides significant\nfunding and incentives for research and development of low-carbon energy production methods, carbon capture, and other programs directed at addressing climate change. The\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022 also provides significant funding for research and development of low-carbon energy production methods, carbon capture, and other programs\ndirected at addressing climate change.\nFurthermore, the EPA has determined that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment, because emissions of GHGs are, according to\nthe EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA, over time, has attempted to restrict emissions of GHGs\nunder existing provisions of the CAA. For example, in August 2015, the EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan (the \"CPP”) to cut carbon emissions from existing power plants, which did\nnot formally go into effect because the U.S. Supreme Court stayed its implementation in February 2016. In July 2019, the EPA adopted the Affordable Clean Energy Rule (the \"ACE\nRule”) that repealed and replaced the CPP. The ACE Rule required states to set appropriate GHG emission standards for power plants within their jurisdiction based upon the\napplication of \"candidate” heat rate improvement measures. In January 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE Rule and remanded it to the agency for further proceedings. In\nFebruary 2021, the EPA issued a memorandum stating the agency’s position that neither the Clean Power Plan nor the ACE Rule are in effect, and future regulation of carbon dioxide\nemissions from existing power generation facilities remains uncertain. In May 2023, the EPA proposed revised new source performance standards for GHG emissions from new and\nreconstructed power plants that undertake a large modification. The finalization of this rule and any future rules or future GHG emission standards may encourage a shift away from\ncoal-fired power generation, adversely impacting the market for our product.\nAdditionally, on March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted final rules to require registrants to disclose certain climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports.\nThe final rules will require the Company to disclose, among other things, material climate-related risks, information about our board of directors’ (\"Board”) oversight of climate-related\nrisks, management’s role in managing material climate-related risks, and Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. Compliance with these rules will be phased in over time\nbased on our filing status as well as the content of the disclosure and assurance requirements. Although the Company is in the process of evaluating the new rules, compliance may\nresult in increased legal, accounting, and other compliance-related costs, as well as place strain on our personnel, systems, and resources.\nAt the state level, several states, including Pennsylvania and Virginia, have already adopted measures requiring GHG emissions to be reduced within state or regional\nboundaries, including cap-and-trade programs and the imposition of renewable energy portfolio standards. Various states and regions have also adopted GHG initiatives, and certain\ngovernmental bodies have imposed, or are considering the imposition of, fees or taxes based on the emission of GHGs by certain facilities. A number of states have also enacted\nlegislative mandates requiring electricity suppliers to use renewable energy sources to generate a certain percentage of power. Furthermore, many state and local leaders have\nintensified or stated their intent to intensify efforts to support international climate commitments and treaties.\nThe extent of future regulation of GHG emissions may inhibit utilities from investing in the building of new coal-fired plants to replace older plants or investing in the\nupgrading of existing coal-fired plants. Any reduction in the amount of coal consumed by electric power generators as a result of actual or potential regulation of GHG emissions\ncould decrease demand for thermal coal, thereby reducing our revenue and adversely affecting our business and results of operations. We or our prospective customers may also\nhave to invest in carbon dioxide capture and storage technologies in order to burn coal and comply with future GHG emission standards.\nFinally, there have been attempts to encourage the reduction of coalbed methane emissions because methane has a greater GHG effect than carbon dioxide and can give rise\nto safety concerns. For example, the EPA has established the Coalbed Methane Outreach Program in an effort to mitigate methane emissions from underground coal mines through\nvoluntary initiatives and outreach in partnership with the coal industry. If new laws or regulations were introduced to reduce coalbed methane emissions, those rules could adversely\naffect our costs of operations by requiring installation of air pollution controls, higher taxes, or costs incurred to purchase credits that permit us to continue operations.\n17\nTable of Contents\nClean Water Act. The CWA and corresponding state laws and regulations affect coal mining operations by restricting the discharge of pollutants, including dredged or fill\nmaterials, into waters of the United States. Likewise, permits are required under the CWA to construct impoundments, fills or other structure in areas that are designated as waters of\nthe United States. For example, prior to placing fill material in waters of the United States, such as with the construction of a valley fill, coal mining companies are required to obtain a\npermit from the Corps under Section 404 of the CWA. The permit can be either a Nationwide Permit (\"NWP”), normally NWP 21, 49 or 50 for coal mining activities, or a more\ncomplicated individual permit. NWPs are designed to allow for an expedited permitting process, while individual permits involve a longer and more detailed review process. The EPA\nhas the authority to veto permits issued by the Corps under the CWA’s Section 404 program that prohibits the discharge of dredged or fill material into regulated waters without a\npermit. Additionally, recent court decisions, regulatory actions and proposed legislation have created uncertainty over CWA jurisdiction and permitting requirements, such as (1) an\nApril 2020 decision further defining the scope of the CWA, wherein the U.S. Supreme Court held that, in certain cases, discharges from a point source to groundwater could fall within\nthe scope of the CWA and require a permit and (2) a May 2023 decision further defining the scope of the CWA, wherein the U.S. Supreme Court held that discharges from a point\nsource to a wetland could fall within the scope of the CWA and require a permit if the adjacent body of water is a relatively permanent body of water connected to traditional\ninterstate navigable waters and the wetland has a continuous surface connection with that water.\nPrior to discharging any pollutants into waters of the United States, coal mining companies must obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (\"NPDES”) permit\nfrom the appropriate state or federal permitting authority. NPDES permits include effluent limitations for discharged pollutants and other terms and conditions, including required\nmonitoring of discharges. Failure to comply with the CWA or NPDES permits can lead to the imposition of significant penalties, litigation, compliance costs and delays in coal\nproduction. Potential changes in state and federally recommended water quality standards may result in the issuance or modification of permits with new or more stringent effluent\nlimits or terms and conditions. For instance, waters designated by states as impaired (i.e., as not meeting current water quality standards) are subject to Total Maximum Daily Load\n(\"TMDL”) regulations, which may lead to the adoption of more stringent discharge standards for our coal mines and could require more costly treatment. Likewise, the water quality\nof certain receiving streams requires an anti-degradation review before approving any discharge permits. TMDL regulations and anti-degradation policies may increase the cost, time\nand difficulty associated with obtaining and complying with NPDES permits. In addition, in certain circumstances private citizens may challenge alleged violations of NPDES permit\nlimits in court. Recently, certain citizen groups have filed lawsuits alleging ongoing discharges of pollutants, including selenium and conductance, from valley fills located at certain\nmining sites in some of the regions where we operate. In West Virginia, several of these cases have been successful for the challengers. While it is difficult to predict the outcome of\nany potential or future suits, such litigation could result in increased compliance costs following the completion of mining at our operations.\nFinally, in June 2015, the EPA and the Corps published a new definition of \"waters of the United States” (\"WOTUS”) that would have expanded areas requiring NPDES or\nCorps Section 404 permits. This definition never took effect as it was replaced by the Navigable Waters Protection Rule (the \"NWPR”) in December 2019. A coalition of states and\ncities, environmental groups and agricultural groups challenged the NWPR, which was vacated by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona in August 2021. In December\n2022, the EPA and Corps announced the final \"Revised Definition of ‘Waters of the United States’” rule. This rule is not currently operative in certain states and for certain parties\ndue to ongoing litigation. In August 2023, the EPA and Corps issued a final rule to amend the \"Revised Definition of ‘Waters of the United States’” rule in response to the U.S.\nSupreme Court’s May 2023 decision in the case of Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency. In the jurisdictions and for the parties where the January 2023 rule is enjoined, the\nEPA and Corps are interpreting \"waters of the United States” consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Sackett and the pre-2015 regulatory regime. To the extent a new\nrule or further litigation expands the scope of the CWA’s jurisdiction, the CWA permits we need may not be issued, may not be issued in a timely fashion, or may be issued with new\nrequirements which restrict our ability to conduct mining operations or to do so profitably.\nResource Conservation and Recovery Act. The RCRA and corresponding state laws establish standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes generated at our\nvarious facilities. Besides affecting current waste disposal practices, the RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past hazardous waste treatment, storage and\n18\nTable of Contents\ndisposal practices. In addition, the RCRA requires certain of our facilities to evaluate and respond to any past release, or threatened release, of a hazardous substance that may pose\na risk to human health or the environment.\nThe RCRA may affect coal mining operations by establishing requirements for the proper management, handling, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes.\nFor example, the EPA regulates coal ash as a solid waste under Subtitle D of the RCRA through its coal combustion residuals (\"CCR”) rule. This rule establishes limits for the location\nof new sites and requires closure of sites that fail to meet prescribed engineering standards, regular inspections of impoundments, and immediate remediation and closure of unlined\nponds that are polluting ground water. As initially promulgated, the rule exempted closed coal ash impoundments located at inactive facilities and allowed for the continued operation\nof unlined or clay-lined ponds that were not polluting groundwater. Additionally, in December 2016, Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act,\nwhich provided for the establishment of state and EPA permit programs for the control of CCR and authorizes states to incorporate the EPA’s final rule for CCR or develop other\ncriteria that are at least as protective as the final rule. In May 2023, the EPA published proposed changes to the CCR rule for legacy CCR surface impoundments and a notice of data\navailability related to the proposed rule in November 2023. The finalization of this proposal, the current requirements of the CCR rules, as well as any future changes in the\nmanagement of CCR, could increase our customers’ operating costs and potentially reduce their ability or need to purchase coal. In addition, contamination caused by the past\ndisposal of CCR, including coal ash, could lead to material liability for our customers under the RCRA or other federal or state laws and potentially further reduce the demand for coal.\nCurrently, certain coal mine wastes, such as earth and rock covering a mineral deposit (commonly referred to as overburden) and coal cleaning wastes, are exempted from\nhazardous waste management under the RCRA. Any change or reclassification of this exemption could significantly increase our coal mining costs.\nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. CERCLA and similar state laws affect coal mining operations by, among other things, imposing\ncleanup requirements for threatened or actual releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under CERCLA and similar state laws, joint and several liability may be\nimposed on hazardous substance generators, site owners, transporters, lessees and others regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity. Although the EPA\nexcludes most wastes generated by coal mining and processing operations from the primary hazardous waste laws, such wastes can, in certain circumstances, constitute hazardous\nsubstances for the purposes of CERCLA. In addition, the disposal, release or spilling of some products used by coal companies in operations, such as chemicals listed as hazardous\nsubstances under CERCLA, could trigger the liability provisions of CERCLA or similar state laws. The EPA periodically evaluates the CERCLA list of hazardous substances. In\nSeptember 2022, the EPA proposed to designate two per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (\"PFAS”), including their salts and structural isomers, as hazardous substances under\nCERCLA. This proposed rule, if finalized, may result in increased costs to cleanup properties at which the listed PFAS were released.\nWe may be subject to liability under CERCLA and similar state laws for coal mines that we currently own, lease or operate or that we or our predecessors have previously\nowned, leased or operated, and sites to which we or our predecessors sent hazardous substances. These liabilities could be significant and materially and adversely impact our\nfinancial results and liquidity.\nEndangered Species and Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Acts. The ESA and similar state legislation protect species designated as threatened, endangered or other\nspecial status. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the \"USFWS”) works closely with the OSMRE and state regulatory agencies to ensure that species subject to the ESA are\nprotected from mining-related impacts. Several species indigenous to the areas in which we operate are protected under the ESA. Other species in the vicinity of our operations may\nhave their listing status reviewed in the future and could also become protected under the ESA. In addition, the USFWS has identified bald eagle habitats in some of the counties\nwhere we operate. The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act prohibits taking certain actions that would harm bald or golden eagles without obtaining a permit from the USFWS.\nCompliance with the requirements of the ESA and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act could have the effect of prohibiting or delaying us from obtaining mining permits. These\nrequirements may also include restrictions on timber harvesting, road building and other mining or agricultural activities in areas containing the affected species or their habitats.\nThere is also increasing interest in nature-related matters\n19\nTable of Contents\nbeyond protected species, such as general biodiversity, which may similarly require us or our customers to incur costs or take measures which may adversely impact our business or\noperations.\nUse of Explosives. Our surface mining operations are subject to numerous regulations relating to blasting activities. Due to these regulations, we will incur costs to design\nand implement blast schedules and to conduct pre-blast surveys and blast monitoring. In addition, the storage of explosives is subject to various regulatory requirements. For\nexample, the Department of Homeland Security requires facilities in possession of chemicals of interest (including ammonium nitrate at certain threshold levels) to complete a\nscreening review. Our mines are low risk, Tier 4 facilities which are not subject to additional security plans. The adoption of future, more stringent standards related to the use of\nexplosives could materially adversely impact our cost or ability to conduct our mining operations.\nNational Environmental Policy Act. The National Environmental Policy Act (the \"NEPA”) requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major\nagency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment, such as issuing a permit or other approval. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will typically\nprepare an environmental assessment to determine the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project. Where the activities in question have significant\nimpacts to the environment, the agency must prepare an environmental impact statement. Compliance with the NEPA can be time-consuming and may result in the imposition of\nmitigation measures that could affect the amount of coal that we are able to produce from mines on federal lands, and may require public comment. Furthermore, whether agencies\nhave complied with the NEPA is subject to protest, appeal or litigation, which can delay or halt projects. The NEPA review process, including potential disputes regarding the level of\nevaluation required for climate change impacts, may extend the time and/or increase the costs and difficulty of obtaining necessary governmental approvals, and may lead to litigation\nregarding the adequacy of the NEPA analysis, which could delay or potentially preclude the issuance of approvals or grant of leases.\nOn July 16, 2020, the Council on Environmental Quality (\"CEQ”) revised NEPA’s implementing regulations to make the NEPA process more efficient, effective, and timely.\nThe rule required federal agencies to develop procedures consistent with the new rule within one year of the rule’s effective date (which was extended to two years in June 2021).\nThese regulations are subject to ongoing litigation in several federal district courts, and in October 2021, CEQ issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the NEPA regulatory\nchanges adopted in 2020 in two phases. Phase I of CEQ’s proposed rulemaking process was finalized on April 20, 2022 and generally restored provisions that were in effect prior to\n2020. Phase II of the proposed rulemaking was published by CEQ in July 2023. Phase II proposes further revisions in an attempt to ensure the NEPA process \"provides for efficient\nand effective environmental reviews,” and meets environmental, environmental justice, and climate change objectives. These rules could create additional delays and costs in the\nNEPA review process or in our operations, or even an inability to obtain necessary federal approvals for our operations due to the increased risk of legal challenges from\nenvironmental groups seeking additional analysis of climate impacts.\nOther Environmental Laws. We are required to comply with numerous other federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations in addition to those previously\ndiscussed. These additional laws include but are not limited to the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-\nKnow Act and similar state laws. Each of these laws can impact permitting or planned operations and can result in additional costs or operational delays.\nSeasonality\nOur primary business is not materially impacted by seasonal fluctuations. Demand for metallurgical coal is generally more heavily influenced by other factors such as the\ngeneral economy, interest rates and commodity prices.\nHuman Capital Resources\nWe believe our employees are a competitive advantage. We seek to foster a culture that supports diversity, equity and inclusion, and strive to provide a safe, healthy and\nrewarding work environment with opportunities for growth. We had 811 employees as of December 31, 2023, including our named executive officers, and nearly all of our employees\nare full-time employees. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we\n20\nTable of Contents\nhave not experienced any strikes or work stoppages related to labor relation issues. We believe we have good relations with our employees. Our human capital resources objectives\ninclude, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, training, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. We also depend on experienced contractors and\nthird-party consultants to conduct some of our day-to-day activities. We plan to continue to use the services of many of these contractors and consultants.\nSafety Philosophy. We have a comprehensive health and safety program based on the core belief that all accidents and occupational illnesses are preventable. We believe\nthat:\n● Business excellence is achieved through the pursuit of safer and more productive work practices.\n● Any task that cannot be performed safely should not be performed.\n● Working safely is a requirement of our employees.\n● Controlling the work environment is important, but human behavior within the work environment is paramount.\n● Safety starts with individual decision-making—all employees must assume a share of responsibility for acts within their control that pose a risk of injury to themselves\nor fellow workers.\n● All levels of the organization must be proactive in implementing safety processes that promote a safe and healthy work environment.\n● Consequently, we are committed to providing a safe work environment; providing our employees with proper training and equipment; and implementing safety and\nhealth rules, policies and programs that foster safety excellence.\nOur safety program includes a focus on the following:\n● Hiring the Right Workers. Our hiring program includes significant pre-employment screening and reference checks.\n● Safety Incentives. We have a compensation system that encourages and rewards excellent safety performance.\n● Communication. We conduct regular safety meetings with the frequent involvement of senior management to reinforce the \"tone at the top.”\n● Drug and Alcohol Testing. We require pre-employment drug screening as well as regular random drug testing that exceeds regulatory requirements.\n● Continuous Improvement Programs. We track key safety performance metrics, including accident rates, violation types and frequencies. We have specific targets in\nthese areas, and we measure performance against these targets. Specific action plans are implemented for targeted improvement in areas where performance falls below\nour expectations.\n● Training. Our training program includes comprehensive new employee orientation and training, annual refresher training and task training components. These training\nmodules are designed to reinforce our high safety expectations. Work rules and procedures are a key element of this training.\n● Accident Investigation. We have a structured accident investigation procedure that identifies root causes of accidents as well as actions necessary to prevent\nreoccurrence. We focus on near misses and close calls as a means of attempting to prevent more serious accidents from occurring.\n● Safety Audits. We conduct periodic safety audits that include workplace examinations, including observation of workers at work, as well as safety program reviews.\nBoth internal and external resources are utilized to conduct these audits.\n● Employee Performance Improvement. A key element of our safety program is the recognition that safe work practices are a requirement of employment. We identify\nemployee performance which is below expectations and develop specific action plans for improvement.\n● Employee Involvement. The key to excellent safety is employee involvement and engagement. We foster direct employee involvement in a number of ways including\naudit participation, accident investigations, as training resources and through solicitation of ideas in small group meetings and through anonymous workplace\nobservation suggestion boxes.\n21\nTable of Contents\n● Positive Reinforcement. Establishing safety as a core belief is paramount to our safety performance. As a result, we look for opportunities to celebrate accomplishments\nand to build pride in our operational safety and performance.\nAvailable Information\nOur investor relations website is ir.ramacoresources.com and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available\non this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC”), corporate governance information (including our Code of\nConduct and Ethics) and press releases. Our filings with the SEC are also available to the public from commercial document retrieval services and at the SEC’s website at\nwww.sec.gov.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business involves certain risks and uncertainties. The following is a description of significant risks that might cause our future financial condition or results of\noperations to differ materially from those expected. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, we may face other risks and uncertainties, some of which may be\nunknown to us and some of which we may deem immaterial. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be\nmaterially and adversely affected. A summary of our risk factors is as follows:\nRisks Related to Our Business\n● Our properties have not yet been fully developed into producing coal mines and, if we experience any development delays or cost increases or are unable to\ncomplete the construction of our facilities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n● We have customer concentration, so the loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest coal customers could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows.\n● Our customer base is highly dependent on the steel industry.\n● Deterioration in the global economic conditions, a worldwide financial downturn or negative credit market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends.\n● Our operations may be disrupted, and our financial results may be adversely affected, by global outbreaks of contagious diseases, including COVID-19.\n● We do not enter into long-term sales contracts for our coal and as a result we are exposed to fluctuations in market pricing.\n● We face uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable coal reserves, and inaccuracies in our estimates could result in lower-than-expected revenues,\nhigher than expected costs and decreased profitability.\n● A substantial or extended decline in the prices we receive for our coal could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and\nability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\n● Changes in the global economic environment, inflation, rising interest rates, recessions or prolonged periods of slow economic growth, and global instability and\nactual and threatened geopolitical conflict, could have an adverse effect on our industry and business, as well as those of our customers and suppliers.\n● Increased competition or a loss of our competitive position could adversely affect sales of, or prices for, our coal, which could impair our profitability.\n● The availability and reliability of transportation facilities and fluctuations in transportation costs could affect the demand for our coal or impair our ability to supply\ncoal to prospective customers.\n22\nTable of Contents\n● Any significant downtime of our major pieces of mining equipment, including any preparation plants, could impair our ability to supply coal to prospective\ncustomers and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\n● Our ability to collect payments from customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness declines or if they fail to honor their contracts with us.\n● If we are unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, we may have to curtail our operations and delay our construction and growth plans,\nwhich may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\n● Our operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain required financial assurance, or if the costs of financial assurance increase materially.\n● Defects in title or loss of any leasehold interests in our properties could limit our ability to conduct mining operations on these properties or result in significant\nunanticipated costs.\n● Substantially all of our mining properties are leased from our affiliates and conflicts of interest may arise in the future as a result.\n● We may face restricted access to international markets in the future.\n● Our lessees could satisfy obligations to their customers with minerals from properties other than ours, depriving us of the ability to receive amounts in excess of\nminimum royalty payments.\n● Technology development involves significant time and expense and can be uncertain.\nRisks Related to Environmental, Health, Safety and Other Regulations\n● The current U.S. administration and Congress could enact legislative and regulatory measures that could adversely affect our mining operations or cost structure or\nour customers’ ability to use coal, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n● Current and future government laws, regulations and other legal requirements relating to protection of the environment and natural resources may increase our\ncosts of doing business and may restrict our coal operations.\n● Our operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, and our properties may have environmental contamination, which could\nexpose us to significant costs and liabilities.\n● We must obtain, maintain, and renew governmental permits and approvals for mining operations, which can be a costly and time-consuming process and result in\nrestrictions on our operations.\n● We and our significant stockholders are subject to the Applicant Violator System.\n● Our mines are subject to stringent federal and state safety regulations that increase our cost of doing business at active operations and may place restrictions on\nour methods of operation. In addition, government inspectors in certain circumstances may have the ability to order our operations to be shut down based on\nsafety considerations.\n● We have reclamation, mine closing, and related environmental obligations under the SMCRA. If the assumptions underlying our accruals are inaccurate, we could\nbe required to expend greater amounts than anticipated.\nRisks Related to Our Company\n● Our ability to pay dividends may be limited by the amount of cash we generate from operations following the payment of fees and expenses, by restrictions of any\nfuture debt instruments and by additional factors unrelated to our profitability.\n● Your percentage of ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\n● Certain of our directors have significant duties with, and spend significant time serving, entities that may compete with us in seeking acquisitions and business\nopportunities and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating time or pursuing business opportunities.\nRisks Related to Our Class B Common Stock Structure\n23\nTable of Contents\n● Holders of Class B common stock are common stockholders of the Company and, therefore, are subject to risks associated with an investment in the Company as a\nwhole, even if the holder does not own shares of Class A common stock.\n● Our Board’s ability to reattribute businesses, assets, and expenses between the Class A common stock and Class B common stock may make it difficult to assess\nthe future prospects of a class of common stock based on past performance.\n● Dividends on our Class B common stock are discretionary and may fluctuate materially quarter to quarter. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to pay\ndividends in the future or what the actual dividends will be for any future periods.\n● The market value of the Class B common stock could be adversely affected by events involving the other assets and businesses of the Company.\n● Our new tracking stock capital structure could create conflicts of interest, and our Board may make decisions that could adversely affect only the holders of one\nclass of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur properties have not yet been fully developed into producing coal mines and, if we experience any development delays or cost increases or are unable to complete the\nconstruction of our facilities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have not completed development plans for all of our coal properties, and do not expect to have full annual production from all of our properties until market conditions\npermit us to resume and complete these development plans. We expect to incur significant capital expenditures until we have completed the development of our properties. In\naddition, the development of our properties involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties that are beyond our control and that may cause delays in,\nor increase the costs associated with, their completion. Accordingly, we may not be able to complete the development of the properties on schedule, at the budgeted cost or at all,\nand any delays beyond the expected development periods or increased costs above those expected to be incurred could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nIf we are unable to complete or are substantially delayed in completing the development of any of our properties, our business, financial condition, results of operations cash\nflows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders could be adversely affected.\nWe have customer concentration, so the loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest coal customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with an increasingly concentrated customer base both domestically and globally.\nThere are inherent risks whenever a significant percentage of total revenues are concentrated with a limited number of customers. Revenues from our largest customers may\nfluctuate from time to time based on numerous factors, including market conditions, which may be outside of our control. If any of our largest customers experience declining\nrevenues due to market, economic or competitive conditions, we could be pressured to reduce the prices that we charge for our coal, which could have an adverse effect on our\nmargins, profitability, cash flows and financial position. If any customers were to significantly reduce their purchases of coal from us, including by failing to buy and pay for coal they\ncommitted to purchase in sales contracts, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders could be adversely\naffected.\nSee Item 8 of Part II, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Concentrations” for additional information.\n24\nTable of Contents\nOur customer base is highly dependent on the steel industry.\nSubstantially all of the metallurgical coal that we produce is sold to steel producers. Therefore, demand for our metallurgical coal is highly correlated to the steel industry.\nThe steel industry’s demand for metallurgical coal is affected by a number of factors including the cyclical nature of that industry’s business, technological developments in the steel-\nmaking process and the availability of substitutes for steel such as aluminum, composites and plastics. A significant reduction in the demand for steel products would reduce the\ndemand for metallurgical coal, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Similarly, if less expensive\ningredients could be used in substitution for metallurgical coal in the integrated steel mill process, the demand for metallurgical coal would materially decrease, which would also\nmaterially adversely affect demand for our metallurgical coal. Our export customers, excluding Canada, include foreign steel producers who may be affected by the tariffs to the extent\ntheir production is imported into the U.S. Retaliatory threats by foreign nations to these tariffs may limit international trade and adversely impact global economic conditions.\nDeterioration in the global economic conditions in any of the industries in which prospective customers operate, a worldwide financial downturn or negative credit market\nconditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nEconomic conditions in the industries in which most of our prospective customers operate, such as steelmaking and electric power generation, substantially deteriorated in\nrecent years and reduced the demand for coal. A deterioration of economic conditions in our prospective customers’ industries could cause a decline in demand for and production of\nmetallurgical coal. Renewed or continued weakness in the economic conditions of any of the industries served by prospective customers could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nOur operations may be disrupted, and our financial results may be adversely affected, by global outbreaks of contagious diseases, including COVID-19.\nGlobal outbreaks of contagious diseases, including the December 2019 outbreak of a strain of coronavirus (\"COVID-19”), have the potential to significantly and adversely\nimpact our operations and business. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization recognized COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Pandemics or disease outbreaks such as the\nCOVID-19 outbreak may have a variety of adverse effects on our business, including by depressing commodity prices and the market value of our securities and limiting the ability of\nour management to meet with potential financing sources. Like other coal companies, our business was adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and measures that were taken\nto mitigate its impact. The pandemic resulted in widespread adverse impacts on our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties with whom we have business relations. The\nspread of COVID-19 had a negative impact on the financial markets, which may impact our ability to obtain additional financing. A prolonged downturn in the financial markets could\nhave an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and ability to raise capital.\nWe cannot predict the full impact that future global outbreaks of contagious diseases, including COVID-19, will have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial\ncondition and results of operations at this time, due to numerous uncertainties. The ultimate impacts will depend on future developments, including, among others, the consequences\nof governmental and other measures designed to slow the spread of such diseases, the development of effective treatments, the duration of the outbreaks, actions taken by\ngovernmental authorities, customers, suppliers and other third parties, workforce availability, and the timing and extent to which normal economic and operating conditions resume.\nWe do not enter into long-term sales contracts for our coal and as a result we are exposed to fluctuations in market pricing.\nSales commitments in the metallurgical coal market are typically not long-term in nature and are generally no longer than one year in duration. Most metallurgical coal\ntransactions in the U.S. are done on a calendar year basis, where both prices and volumes are fixed in the third and fourth quarter for the following calendar year. Globally the market\nis evolving to shorter term pricing. Some annual contracts have shifted to quarterly contracts and most volumes\n25\nTable of Contents\nare being sold on an indexed basis, where prices are determined by averaging the leading spot indexes reported in the market and adjusting for quality. As a result, we are subject to\nfluctuations in market pricing. We are not protected from oversupply or market conditions where we cannot sell our coal at economic prices. Metallurgical coal has been an extremely\nvolatile commodity over the past ten years and prices are likely to be volatile in the future. There can be no assurances we will be able to mitigate such conditions as they arise. Any\nsustained failure to be able to market our coal during such periods would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and\nability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nThe failure to access coal preparation facilities may have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce coal for our prospective customers and to meet quality\nspecifications.\nThe costs of establishing the infrastructure necessary to enable us to continue to ramp up our mining operations will be significant. We have constructed preparation and\nloading facilities at our Elk Creek Complex and have recently undertaken expansion projects to increase the rates of processing and preparation. Our Berwind Complex will remain\nunder development until we reach our full targeted annual coal production. Some of the Berwind coal will continue to be washed at our active Knox Creek plant until our Berwind\nplant is fully up and running. We also endeavor to purchase, relocate, and reassemble preparation plant assets at our Maben complex for future use. Our failure to provide the\nnecessary preparation, processing and loading facilities for our projects would have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nThe risks associated with the construction and operation of mines, processing plants and related infrastructure include:\n● the potential lack of availability or cost of skilled and unskilled labor, equipment and principal supplies needed for construction of facilities;\n● the need to obtain necessary environmental and other governmental approvals and permits and the timing of the receipt of those approvals and permits;\n● industrial accidents;\n● geologic mine failures, surface facility construction failures or mining, coal processing or transport equipment failures;\n● structural failure of an impoundment or refuse area;\n● natural phenomena such as inclement weather conditions, floods, droughts, rockslides and seismic activity;\n● unusual or unexpected geological and coal quality conditions;\n● potential opposition from non-governmental organizations, environmental groups or other activists, which may delay or prevent development activities; and\n● restrictions or regulations imposed by governmental or regulatory authorities.\nThe costs, timing and complexities of developing our projects may be greater than anticipated. Cost estimates may increase significantly as more detailed engineering work is\ncompleted on a project. It is common in mining operations to experience unexpected costs, problems and delays during construction, development and mine start-up.\nProduct alternatives or other technologies may reduce demand for our products.\nSubstantially all of our coal production is comprised of metallurgical coal, which commands a significant price premium over the majority of other forms of coal because of its\nuse in blast furnaces for steel production. Metallurgical coal has specific physical and chemical properties, which are necessary for efficient blast furnace operation. Steel producers\nare continually investigating alternative steel production technologies with a view to reducing production costs. The steel industry has increased utilization of electric arc furnaces or\npulverized coal injection processes, which reduce or eliminate the use of furnace coke, an intermediate product produced from metallurgical coal and, in turn, generally decreases the\ndemand for metallurgical coal. Many alternative technologies are designed to use lower quality coals or other sources of carbon instead of higher cost high-quality metallurgical coal.\nWhile conventional blast furnace technology has been the most economic large-scale steel production technology for a number of years, and emergent technologies typically take\nmany years to commercialize, there can be no assurance that over the longer term\n26\nTable of Contents\ncompetitive technologies not reliant on metallurgical coal would not emerge, which could reduce the demand and price premiums for metallurgical coal.\nMoreover, we may produce and market other coal products, such as thermal coal, which are also subject to alternative competition. Alternative technologies are continually\nbeing investigated and developed in order to reduce production costs or minimize environmental or social impact. In particular, alternatives with lower carbon footprints than our\nproducts are currently being researched and developed, as our customers are subject to increasing market and/or regulatory pressure to reduce their impacts on climate change.\nFurther, the development and use of emerging technologies in the generation, transmission, storage and consumption of energy, including renewable energy, battery storage, and\nenergy efficiency technologies, may increase the availability of alternative energy sources or lower demand for coal, resulting in lower prices and revenues. If competitive\ntechnologies emerge that use other materials in place of or otherwise eliminate the need for our products, demand and price for our products might fall.\nWe face uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable coal reserves, and inaccuracies in our estimates could result in lower-than-expected revenues, higher than\nexpected costs and decreased profitability.\nCoal is economically recoverable when the price at which coal can be sold exceeds the costs and expenses of mining and selling the coal. Any forecasts of our future\nperformance are based on, among other things, estimates of our recoverable coal reserves. We base our reserve information on geologic data, coal ownership information and current\nand proposed mine plans. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of coal and costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors\nbeyond our control. As a result, estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain. Some of the factors and assumptions that can impact economically\nrecoverable coal reserve estimates include:\n● geologic and mining conditions;\n● historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas;\n● the assumed effects of environmental and other regulations and taxes by governmental agencies;\n● our ability to obtain, maintain and renew all required permits;\n● future improvements in mining technology;\n● assumptions related to future prices; and\n● future operating costs, including the cost of materials, and capital expenditures.\nEach of the factors that impacts reserve estimation may vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating the reserves. For these reasons, estimates of coal\nreserves may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our future coal reserves may vary from estimates, and these variances may be material.\nAs a result, our estimates may not accurately reflect our actual future coal reserves.\nOur inability to acquire additional coal reserves that are economically recoverable may have a material adverse effect on our future profitability.\nOur profitability depends substantially on our ability to mine, in a cost-effective manner, coal reserves that possess the quality characteristics that prospective customers\ndesire. Because our reserves will decline as we mine our coal, our future profitability depends upon our ability to acquire additional coal reserves that are economically recoverable to\nreplace the reserves we will produce. If we fail to acquire or develop sufficient additional reserves over the long term to replace the reserves depleted by our production, our existing\nreserves could eventually be exhausted.\nWe are dependent on contractors for the successful completion of the development of our properties.\nWe regularly use contractors in the development of our mines. Timely and cost-effective completion of the development of our properties, including necessary facilities and\ninfrastructure, in compliance with agreed specifications is central to our business strategy and is highly dependent on the performance of our contractors under the agreements with\nthem.\n27\nTable of Contents\nAlthough some agreements may provide for liquidated damages, if the contractor fails to perform in the manner required with respect to certain of its obligations, the events\nthat trigger a requirement to pay liquidated damages may delay or impair the operation of our properties, and any liquidated damages that we receive may not be sufficient to cover\nthe damages that we suffer as a result of any such delay or impairment. Further, we may have disagreements with our contractors about different elements of the construction\nprocess, which could lead to the assertion of rights and remedies under their contracts and increase the costs associated with development of the properties or result in a contractor’s\nunwillingness to perform further work. If any contractor is unable or unwilling to perform according to the negotiated terms and timetable of its respective agreement for any reason or\nterminates its agreement, we would be required to engage a substitute contractor. This would likely result in significant project delays and increased costs, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nPrices for coal are volatile and can fluctuate widely based upon a number of factors beyond our control, including oversupply relative to the demand available for our coal and\nweather. A substantial or extended decline in the prices we receive for our coal could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and\nability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nOur financial results are significantly affected by the prices we receive for our coal and depend, in part, on the margins that we earn on sales of our coal. Our margins will\nreflect the price we receive for our coal over our cost of producing and transporting our coal. Prices and quantities under U.S. domestic metallurgical coal sales contracts are generally\nbased on expectations of the next year’s coal prices at the time the contract is entered into, renewed, extended or re-opened. Pricing in the global seaborne market is moving towards\nshorter term pricing models, typically using indexes. The expectation of future prices for coal depends upon many factors beyond our control, including the following:\n● the market price for coal;\n● overall domestic and global economic conditions, including the supply of and demand for domestic and foreign coal, coke and steel;\n● the consumption pattern of industrial consumers, electricity generators and residential users;\n● weather conditions in our markets that affect the demand for thermal coal or that affect the ability to produce metallurgical coal;\n● competition from other coal suppliers;\n● technological advances affecting energy consumption;\n● the costs, availability and capacity of transportation infrastructure;\n● the impact of domestic and foreign governmental laws and regulations, including environmental and climate change regulations and regulations affecting the coal\nmining industry, and delays in the receipt of, failure to receive, failure to maintain or revocation of necessary governmental permits; and\n● increased utilization by the steel industry of electric arc furnaces or pulverized coal injection processes, which reduce or eliminate the use of furnace coke, an\nintermediate product produced from metallurgical coal, and generally decrease the demand for metallurgical coal.\nMetallurgical coal is an extremely volatile commodity. There are no assurances that supplies will remain low, that demand will not decrease or that overcapacity may resume,\nwhich could cause declines in the prices of and demand for coal, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in the global economic environment, inflation, rising interest rates, recessions or prolonged periods of slow economic growth, and global instability and actual and\nthreatened geopolitical conflict, could have an adverse effect on our industry and business, as well as those of our customers and suppliers.\nOverall economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, including adverse factors such as inflation, rising interest rates, supply chain disruptions and the impacts of the war in\nUkraine, significantly impact our business. Periods of economic downturn or continued uncertainty could result in difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or\n28\nTable of Contents\nprofitability and we may experience an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to economic conditions, including credit and capital market conditions, inflation, prevailing interest rates, and political factors, which if changed\ncould negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Political factors include, but are not limited to, changes to tax laws and regulations resulting in increased\nincome tax liability, increased regulation, such as carbon emissions limitations or trading mechanisms, limitations on exports of energy and raw materials, and trade remedies. Actions\ntaken by the U.S. government could affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine has had a broad range of adverse impacts on global economic conditions, some of which have had and are likely to continue to have adverse\nimpacts on our business, including increased raw material and energy costs, softer customer demand and lower steel prices.\nAdditionally, we are also exposed to risks associated with the business success and creditworthiness of our suppliers and customers. If our customers or suppliers are\nnegatively impacted by a slowdown in economic markets, we may face the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials,\nand increased risk of insolvency and other credit related issues of customers or suppliers, which could delay payments from customers, result in increased customer defaults and\ncause our suppliers to delay filling, or to be unable to fill, our needs at all or on a timely or cost-effective basis. The occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIncreased competition or a loss of our competitive position could adversely affect sales of, or prices for, our coal, which could impair our profitability. In addition, foreign\ncurrency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal abroad.\nWe compete with other producers primarily on the basis of coal quality, delivered costs to the customer and reliability of supply. We compete primarily with U.S. coal\nproducers and with some Canadian coal producers for sales of metallurgical coal to domestic steel producers and, to a lesser extent, thermal coal to electric power generators. We also\ncompete with both domestic and foreign coal producers for sales of metallurgical coal in international markets. Certain of these coal producers may have greater financial resources\nand larger reserve bases than we do. We sell coal to the seaborne metallurgical coal market, which is significantly affected by international demand and competition.\nWe cannot assure you that competition from other producers will not adversely affect us in the future. The coal industry has experienced significant consolidation in recent\nyears, including consolidation among some of our major competitors. We cannot assure you that the result of current or further consolidation in the coal industry, or the\nreorganization through bankruptcy of competitors with large legacy liabilities, will not adversely affect us. A number of our competitors have idled production over the last several\nyears in light of lower metallurgical coal prices. A stabilization or increase in coal prices could encourage existing producers to expand capacity or could encourage new producers to\nenter the market.\nIn addition, we face competition from foreign producers that sell their coal in the export market. Potential changes to international trade agreements, trade concessions,\nforeign currency fluctuations or other political and economic arrangements may benefit coal producers operating in countries other than the United States. Additionally, North\nAmerican steel producers face competition from foreign steel producers, which could adversely impact the financial condition and business of our prospective customers. We cannot\nassure you that we will be able to compete on the basis of price or other factors with companies that in the future may benefit from favorable foreign trade policies or other\narrangements. Coal is sold internationally in U.S. dollars and, as a result, general economic conditions in foreign markets and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may provide\nour foreign competitors with a competitive advantage. If our competitors’ currencies decline against the U.S. dollar or against our prospective foreign customers’ local currencies,\nthose competitors may be able to offer lower prices for coal to prospective customers. Furthermore, if the currencies of our prospective overseas customers were to significantly\ndecline in value in comparison to the U.S. dollar, those prospective customers may seek decreased prices for the coal we sell to them. Consequently, currency\n29\nTable of Contents\nfluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal in international markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows.\nOur business involves many hazards and operating risks, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance. The occurrence of a significant accident or other event that is not\nfully insured could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nOur mining operations, including our preparation and transportation infrastructure, are subject to many hazards and operating risks. Underground mining and related\nprocessing activities present inherent risks of injury to persons and damage to property and equipment. Our mines are subject to a number of operating risks that could disrupt\noperations, decrease production and increase the cost of mining for varying lengths of time, thereby adversely affecting our operating results. In addition, if coal production declines,\nwe may not be able to produce sufficient amounts of coal to deliver under future sales contracts. Our inability to satisfy contractual obligations could result in prospective customers\ninitiating claims against us. The operating risks that may have a significant impact on our future coal operations include:\n● variations in thickness of seams of coal;\n● adverse geologic conditions, including amounts of rock and other natural materials intruding into the coal seam, that could affect the stability of the roof and the\nside walls of the mine;\n● environmental hazards;\n● mining and processing equipment failures, structural failures and unexpected maintenance problems;\n● fires or explosions, including as a result of methane, coal, coal dust or other explosive materials, or other accidents;\n● unexpected mine accidents, including rock-falls and explosions caused by the ignition of metallurgical coal dust, natural gas or other explosive sources at our mine\nsites or fires caused by the spontaneous combustion of metallurgical coal or similar mining accidents;\n● inclement or hazardous weather conditions and natural disasters or other force majeure events;\n● seismic activities, ground failures, rock bursts or structural cave-ins or slides;\n● delays in moving our mining equipment;\n● railroad delays or derailments;\n● security breaches or terroristic acts; and\n● other hazards or occurrences that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution and suspension of operations.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial loss to us as a result of claims for:\n● personal injury or loss of life;\n● damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, including our coal properties and our coal production or transportation facilities;\n● pollution, contamination and other environmental damage to our properties or the properties of others;\n● potential legal liability and monetary losses;\n● regulatory investigations, actions and penalties;\n● suspension of our operations; and\n● repair and remediation costs.\nAlthough we maintain insurance for a number of risks and hazards, we may not be insured or fully insured, and we may not be able to recover under our insurance policies,\nagainst the losses or liabilities that could arise from a significant accident in our future coal operations. We may elect not to obtain insurance for any or all of these risks if we believe\nthat the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution, contamination and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable.\nMoreover, a significant mine accident or regulatory infraction could potentially cause a mine shutdown. For example, on July 10, 2022, we discovered that a material methane ignition\nat our Berwind mining complex had occurred. See \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Methane Ignition at Berwind Mine”\nfor additional information. The\n30\nTable of Contents\noccurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to\npay dividends to our stockholders.\nIn addition, if any of the foregoing changes, conditions or events occurs and is not determined to be a force majeure event, any resulting failure on our part to deliver coal to\nthe purchaser under contract could result in economic penalties, suspension or cancellation of shipments or ultimately termination of the agreement, any of which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nOur operations are located in a single geographic region, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a single geographic area, including adverse impacts of\nweaker conditions associated with climate change.\nCurrently, all of our active operations are conducted in a single geographic region in the eastern United States in the Appalachian basin. The geographic concentration of\nour operations may disproportionately expose us to disruptions in our operations if the region experiences severe weather, transportation capacity constraints, constraints on the\navailability of required equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, natural disasters, pandemics (such as COVID-19) or interruption of\ntransportation or other events that impact the region in which we operate or its surrounding areas. If any of these factors were to impact the region in which we operate more than\nother coal producing regions, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected relative to other mining companies that have a more\ngeographically diversified asset portfolio.\nIn addition, weather conditions associated with climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other severe weather events,\nmay impact our operations, personnel, physical assets, supply chain, distribution chain, access to raw materials such as water and the cost or availability of insurance. If any such\neffects were to occur in areas where we or our customers operate, they could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and cash flows. Our ability to mitigate the\nadverse physical impacts of climate change depends in part upon our disaster preparedness and response and business continuity planning.\nThe availability and reliability of transportation facilities and fluctuations in transportation costs could affect the demand for our coal or impair our ability to supply coal to\nprospective customers.\nTransportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply coal to prospective customers. Any significant delays, interruptions, or other limitations on the\nability to transport our coal, including those similar to the rail-related constraints we experienced in 2022, could negatively affect our operations. Delays and interruptions of rail\nservices because of accidents, failure to complete construction of rail infrastructure, infrastructure damage, lack of rail or port capacity, weather-related problems, governmental\nregulation, terrorism, strikes, lockouts, third-party actions or other events could impair our ability to supply coal to customers and adversely affect our profitability. In addition,\ntransportation costs represent a significant portion of the delivered cost of coal and, as a result, the cost of delivery is a critical factor in a customer’s purchasing decision. Increases\nin transportation costs, including increases resulting from emission control requirements and fluctuations in the price of locomotive diesel fuel and demurrage, could make our coal\nless competitive, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nAny significant downtime of our major pieces of mining equipment, including any preparation plants, could impair our ability to supply coal to prospective customers and\nmaterially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe depend on several major pieces of mining equipment to produce and transport our coal, including, but not limited to, underground continuous mining units and coal\nconveying systems, surface mining equipment such as highwall miners, front-end loaders and coal overburden haul trucks, preparation plants and related facilities, conveyors and\ntransloading facilities. If any of these pieces of equipment or facilities suffered major damage or were destroyed by fire, abnormal wear, flooding, incorrect operation or otherwise, we\nmay be unable to replace or repair them in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost, which would impact our ability to produce and transport coal and materially and adversely affect\nour business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Moreover, the MSHA and other regulatory agencies sometimes make changes with regards to requirements\nfor pieces of equipment. Such changes could\n31\nTable of Contents\ncause delays if manufacturers and suppliers are unable to make the required changes in compliance with mandated deadlines.\nIf either our preparation plants, or train loadout facilities, or those of a third party processing or loading our coal, suffer extended downtime, including from major damage, or\nis destroyed, our ability to process and deliver coal to prospective customers would be materially impacted, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of\noperations, financial condition, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. For example, in late-2018, we experienced a partial structural failure at one of the raw coal\nstorage silos that feeds our Elk Creek plant in West Virginia, which idled our Elk Creek preparation plant for approximately one month. We also experienced a methane ignition at the\nBerwind No. 1 mine in the third quarter of 2022, which required the mine to be idled until production was restarted in the first quarter of 2023.\nIf customers do not enter into, extend or honor contracts with us, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nCoal mined from our operations is subject to testing by prospective customers for its ability to meet various specifications and to work satisfactorily in their ovens and other\nfacilities prior to entering into contracts for purchase (which are typically short-term orders having terms of one year or less). If we are unable to successfully test our coals or enter\ninto new contracts for the sale of our coal, our ability to achieve profitability would be materially adversely affected. Once we enter into contracts, if a substantial portion of our sales\ncontracts are modified or terminated and we are unable to replace the contracts (or if new contracts are priced at lower levels), our results of operations would be adversely affected,\nperhaps materially. In addition, if customers refuse to accept shipments of our coal for which they have a contractual obligation, our revenues could be substantially affected and we\nmay have to reduce production at our mines until the customer’s contractual obligations are honored. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the payments we receive\nwhich could affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nCertain provisions in typical long-term sales contracts provide limited protection during adverse economic conditions, which may eventually result in economic penalties to us\nor permit the customer to terminate the contract. Furthermore, our ability to collect payments from prospective customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness declines or\nif they fail to honor their contracts with us.\nWe do not expect to enter into significant long-term sales contracts, but if we do, price adjustment, \"price reopener” and other similar provisions typical in long-term sales\ncontracts may reduce protection from short-term coal price volatility traditionally provided by such contracts. Price reopener provisions may be included in our future sales contracts.\nThese price reopener provisions may automatically set a new price based on prevailing market price or, in some instances, require the parties to agree on a new price, sometimes\nwithin a specified range of prices. Any adjustment or renegotiations leading to a significantly lower contract price could adversely affect our profitability. Some annual metallurgical\ncoal contracts have shifted to quarterly contracts and many include prices determined by averaging the leading spot indexes reported in the market, exposing us further to risks\nrelated to pricing volatility.\nOur ability to receive payment for coal sold and delivered depends on the continued solvency and creditworthiness of prospective customers. The number of domestic steel\nproducers is small, and they compete globally for steel production. If their business or creditworthiness suffers, we may bear an increased risk with respect to payment default.\nCompetition with other coal suppliers could force us to extend credit to customers and on terms that could increase the risk we bear with respect to payment default. We could also\nenter into agreements to supply coal to energy trading and brokering customers under which a customer sells coal to end-users. If the creditworthiness of any prospective energy\ntrading and brokering customer declines, we may not be able to collect payment for all coal sold and delivered to or on behalf of this customer.\nIn addition, if customers refuse to accept shipments of our coal that they have a contractual obligation to purchase, our revenues will decrease, and we may have to reduce\nproduction at our mines until prospective customers’ contractual obligations are honored. Our inability to collect payment from counterparties to our sales contracts may materially\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\n32\nTable of Contents\nWe may be unsuccessful in integrating the operations of any future acquisitions, including acquisitions involving new lines of business, with our existing operations, and in\nrealizing all or any part of the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions.\nFrom time to time, we may evaluate and acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing assets and business, such as the mineral lease with the\nMcDonald Land Company for coal reserves adjacent to our Elk Creek mine complex near Logan, West Virginia. The assets and businesses we acquire may be dissimilar from our initial\nlines of business. Acquisitions may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness. Our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly as\na result of future acquisitions. We may also add new lines of business to our existing operations.\nFurther, unexpected costs and challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations or management are combined, and we may experience unanticipated\ndelays in realizing the benefits of an acquisition. Entry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar and may lead to\nincreased litigation and regulatory risk. Also, following an acquisition, we may discover previously unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business or assets for which we\nhave no recourse under applicable indemnification provisions. If an acquired business or new line of business generates insufficient revenue or if we are unable to efficiently manage\nour expanded operations, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nTo maintain and grow our business, we will be required to make substantial capital expenditures. If we are unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms,\nwe may have to curtail our operations and delay our construction and growth plans, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and cash flows, and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nIn order to maintain and grow our business, we will need to make substantial capital expenditures associated with our mines and the construction of coal preparation\nfacilities which have not yet been constructed. Constructing, maintaining, repairing and expanding mines and infrastructure, including coal preparation and loading facilities, is capital\nintensive. Specifically, the exploration, permitting and development of coal reserves, and the maintenance of machinery, equipment and facilities, and compliance with applicable laws\nand regulations require substantial capital expenditures. While we funded a significant amount of the capital expenditures needed to build out our mining and preparation\ninfrastructure at our Elk Creek property with cash on hand, we must continue to invest capital to maintain or to increase our production and to develop any future acquired properties.\nDecisions to increase our production levels could also affect our capital needs. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our production levels or generate sufficient\ncash flow, or that we will have access to sufficient financing to continue our production, exploration, permitting and development activities, and we may be required to defer all or a\nportion of our capital expenditures.\nIf we do not make sufficient or effective capital expenditures, we will be unable to develop and grow our business. To fund our projected capital expenditures, we will be\nrequired to use cash from our operations, incur debt or issue additional common stock or other equity securities. Using cash from our operations will reduce cash available for\nmaintaining or increasing our operating activities and paying dividends to our stockholders. Our ability to obtain bank financing or our ability to access the capital markets for future\nequity or debt offerings may be limited by our financial condition at the time of any such financing or offering and the covenants in our future debt agreements, as well as by general\neconomic conditions, contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, incurring debt may significantly increase our interest expense and financial leverage, and issuing additional equity securities may result in significant\nstockholder dilution.\nWe may not be able to obtain equipment, parts and supplies in a timely manner, in sufficient quantities or at reasonable costs to support our coal mining and transportation\noperations.\nCoal mining consumes large quantities of commodities including steel, copper, rubber products and liquid fuels and requires the use of capital equipment. Some\ncommodities, such as steel, are needed to comply with roof control\n33\nTable of Contents\nplans required by regulation. The prices we pay for commodities and capital equipment are strongly impacted by the global market. A rapid or significant increase in the costs of\ncommodities or capital equipment we use in our operations could impact our mining operations costs because we may have a limited ability to negotiate lower prices and, in some\ncases, may not have a ready substitute.\nWe use equipment in our coal mining and transportation operations such as continuous mining units, conveyors, shuttle cars, rail cars, locomotives, and roof bolters. We\nprocure this equipment from a concentrated group of suppliers, and obtaining this equipment often involves long lead times. Occasionally, demand for such equipment by mining\ncompanies can be high and some types of equipment may be in short supply. Delays in receiving or shortages of this equipment, as well as the raw materials used in the\nmanufacturing of supplies and mining equipment, which, in some cases, do not have ready substitutes, or the cancellation of any future supply contracts under which we obtain\nequipment and other consumables, could limit our ability to obtain these supplies or equipment. In addition, if any of our suppliers experiences an adverse event, or decides to no\nlonger do business with us, we may be unable to obtain sufficient equipment and raw materials in a timely manner or at a reasonable price to allow us to meet our production goals\nand our revenues may be adversely impacted. We use considerable quantities of steel in the mining process. If the price of steel or other materials increases substantially or if the\nvalue of the U.S. dollar declines relative to foreign currencies with respect to certain imported supplies or other products, our operating expenses could increase. Any of the foregoing\nevents could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nWe experienced rail-related constraints in 2022, which led to higher coal inventory levels at December 31, 2022.\nWe are a holding company, and we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us in order to satisfy our financial obligations and to make dividend\npayments.\nWe are a holding company, and our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own all of our operating assets. We have no significant assets other than the equity\ninterests in our subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to pay our obligations and to make dividend payments, depends entirely on our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to\nus. The ability of a subsidiary to make these distributions could be affected by a claim or other action by a third-party, including a creditor, or by the law of their respective\njurisdictions of formation which regulates the payment of dividends. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, we may not be able to declare or pay dividends.\nOur operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain required financial assurance, or if the costs of financial assurance increase materially.\nFederal and state laws require financial assurance to secure our permit obligations including to reclaim lands used for mining, to pay federal and state workers’ compensation\nand black lung benefits, and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations. The changes in the market for coal used to generate electricity in recent years have led to bankruptcies\ninvolving prominent coal producers. Several of these companies relied on self-bonding to guarantee their responsibilities under the SMCRA permits including for reclamation. In\nresponse to these bankruptcies, the OSMRE issued a Policy Advisory in August 2016 to state agencies that was intended to discourage authorized states from approving self-\nbonding arrangements. Although the Policy Advisory was rescinded in October 2017, certain states, including Virginia, had previously announced that it would no longer accept self-\nbonding to secure reclamation obligations under the state mining laws. Individually and collectively, these and future revised financial assurance requirements may lead to increased\ndemand for other forms of financial assurance, which may strain capacity for those instruments and increase our costs of obtaining and maintaining the amounts of financial\nassurance needed for our operations, which may delay the timing for and increase the costs of obtaining this financial assurance.\nWe use surety bonds, trusts and letters of credit to provide financial assurance for certain transactions and business activities. If, in the future, we are unable to secure\nsurety bonds for these obligations and are forced to secure letters of credit indefinitely or obtain some other form of financial assurance at too high of a cost, we may not be able to\nobtain permits and production on our properties could be adversely affected. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and ability to\npay dividends to our stockholders.\n34\nTable of Contents\nOur mines are located in areas containing oil and natural gas operations, which may require us to coordinate our operations with those of oil and natural gas drillers.\nOur coal reserves are in areas containing developed or undeveloped oil and natural gas deposits and reservoirs, including the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, and our\nVirginia reserves are currently the subject of substantial oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, including by horizontal drilling. If we have received a permit for our\nmining activities, then, while we will have to coordinate our mining with such oil and natural gas drillers, our mining activities are expected to have priority over any oil and natural gas\ndrillers with respect to the land covered by our permit. For reserves outside of our permits, we expect to engage in discussions with drilling companies on potential areas on which\nthey can drill that may have a minimal effect on our mine plan. Depending on priority of interests, our operations may have to avoid existing oil and gas wells or expend sums to plug\noil and gas wells.\nIf a well is in the path of our mining for coal on land that has not yet been permitted for our mining activities, we may not be able to mine through the well unless we purchase\nit. The cost of purchasing a producing horizontal or vertical well could be substantial. Horizontal wells with multiple laterals extending from the well pad may access larger oil and\nnatural gas reserves than a vertical well, which would typically result in a higher cost to acquire. The cost associated with purchasing oil and natural gas wells that are in the path of\nour coal mining activities may make mining through those wells uneconomical, thereby effectively causing a loss of significant portions of our coal reserves, which could materially\nand adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nDefects in title or loss of any leasehold interests in our properties could limit our ability to conduct mining operations on these properties or result in significant unanticipated\ncosts.\nWe conduct a significant part of our mining operations on properties that we lease. A title defect or the loss of any lease upon expiration of its term, upon a default or\notherwise, could adversely affect our ability to mine the associated reserves and/or process the coal we mine. Title to most of our owned or leased properties and mineral rights is not\nusually verified until we make a commitment to develop a property, which may not occur until after we have obtained necessary permits and completed exploration of the property. In\nsome cases, we rely on title information or representations and warranties provided by our lessors or grantors. Our right to mine some of our reserves may be adversely affected if\ndefects in title or boundaries exist or if a lease expires. Any challenge to our title or leasehold interests could delay the exploration and development of the property and could\nultimately result in the loss of some or all of our interest in the property and, accordingly, require us to reduce our estimated coal reserves. Mining operations from time to time may\nrely on an expired lease that we are unable to renew. If we were to be in default with respect to leases for properties on which we have mining operations, we may have to close down\nor significantly alter the sequence of such mining operations, which may adversely affect our future coal production and future revenues. If we mine on property that we do not own\nor lease, we could incur liability for such mining.\nIn any such case, the investigation and resolution of title issues would divert management’s time from our business and our results of operations could be adversely\naffected. Additionally, if we lose any leasehold interests relating to any preparation plants, we may need to find an alternative location to process our coal and load it for delivery to\ncustomers, which could result in significant unanticipated costs.\nIn order to obtain leases or mining contracts to conduct our mining operations on property where these defects exist, we may in the future have to incur unanticipated costs.\nIn addition, we may not be able to successfully negotiate new leases or mining contracts for properties containing additional reserves or maintain our leasehold interests in properties\nwhere we have not commenced mining operations during the term of the lease. Some leases have minimum production requirements. Failure to meet those requirements could result in\nlosses of prepaid royalties and, in some rare cases, could result in a loss of the lease itself.\n35\nTable of Contents\nWhile none of our employees who conduct mining operations are currently members of unions, our business could be adversely affected by union activities.\nWe are not subject to any collective bargaining or union agreement with respect to properties we currently control. However, it is possible that future employees, or those of\nour contract miners, who conduct mining operations may join or seek recognition to form a labor union or may be required to become labor agreement signatories. If some or all of the\nemployees who conduct mining operations were to become unionized, it could adversely affect productivity, increase labor costs and increase the risk of work stoppages at our\nmines. If a work stoppage were to occur, it could interfere with operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows\nand our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nA shortage of skilled labor in the mining industry could pose a risk to achieving improved labor productivity, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nEfficient coal mining using modern techniques and equipment requires skilled laborers, preferably with at least a year of experience and proficiency in multiple mining tasks.\nThe demand for skilled employees sometimes causes a significant constriction of the labor supply resulting in higher labor costs. When met coal producers compete for skilled\nminers, recruiting challenges can occur and employee turnover rates can increase, which negatively affect operating efficiency and costs. In the event there is a shortage of\nexperienced labor, it could have an adverse impact on our labor productivity and our ability to expand production in the event there is an increase in the demand for our coal.\nWe may face restricted access to international markets in the future.\nAccess to international markets may be subject to ongoing interruptions and trade barriers due to policies and tariffs of individual countries, and the actions of certain\ninterest groups to restrict the import or export of certain commodities. There can be no assurance that our access to these markets will not be restricted in the future. An inability for\nU.S. metallurgical coal suppliers to access international markets would likely result in an oversupply of metallurgical coal in the domestic market, resulting in a decrease in prices,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nWe and our significant stockholders are subject to the Applicant Violator System.\nUnder the SMCRA and its state law counterparts, all coal mining applications must include mandatory \"ownership and control” information, which generally includes listing\nthe names of our officers and directors, and our principal stockholders owning 10 percent or more of our voting shares, among others. Ownership and control reporting requirements\nare designed to allow regulatory review of any entities or persons deemed to have ownership or control of a coal mine, and bars the granting of a coal mining permit to any such\nentity or person (including any \"owner and controller”) who has had a mining permit revoked or suspended, or a bond or similar security forfeited within the five-year period\npreceding a permit application or application for a permit revision. Regulatory agencies also block the issuance of permits to an applicant who, or whose owner and controller, has\npermit violations outstanding that have not been timely abated.\nA federal database, known as the Applicant Violator System, is maintained for this purpose. Certain relationships are presumed to constitute ownership or control, including\nthe following: being an officer or director of an entity; being the operator of the coal mining operation; having the ability to commit the financial or real property assets or working\nresources of the permittee or operator; based on the instruments of ownership or the voting securities of a corporate entity, owning of record 10% or more of the mining operator,\namong others. This presumption, in most cases, can be rebutted where the person or entity can demonstrate that it in fact does not or did not have authority directly or indirectly to\ndetermine the manner in which the relevant coal mining operation is conducted. An ownership and control notice must be filed by us each time an entity obtains a 10% or greater\ninterest in us. If we have unabated violations of the SMCRA or its state law counterparts, have a coal mining permit suspended or revoked, or forfeit a reclamation bond, we and our\n\"owners and controllers,” as discussed above, may be prohibited from obtaining new coal mining permits, or amendments to existing permits, until such violations of law are\ncorrected. This is known as being \"permit-blocked.” Additionally, Yorktown and Mr. Atkins are each currently deemed an \"owner or controller” of a number of other mining\n36\nTable of Contents\ncompanies; as such, we could be permit-blocked based upon the violations of or permit-blocked status of an \"owner or controller” of us. This could adversely affect production from\nour properties.\nWe may be subject to additional limitations on our ability to conduct mining operations due to federal jurisdiction.\nWe may conduct some underground mining activities on properties that are within the designated boundary of federally protected lands or national forests where the above-\nmentioned restrictions within the meaning of the SMCRA could apply. Federal court decisions could pose a potential restriction on underground mining within 100 feet of a public\nroad as well as other restrictions. If these SMCRA restrictions ultimately apply to underground mining, considerable uncertainty would exist about the nature and extent of this\nrestriction. While it could remain possible to obtain permits for underground mining operations in these areas even where this 100-foot restriction was applied, the time and expense\nof that permitting process would be likely to increase significantly, and the restrictions placed on the mining of those properties could adversely affect our costs.\nOur lessees could satisfy obligations to their customers with minerals from properties other than ours, depriving us of the ability to receive amounts in excess of minimum\nroyalty payments.\nMineral supply contracts generally do not require operators to satisfy their obligations to their customers with resources mined from specific locations. Several factors may\ninfluence a lessee’s decision to supply its customers with minerals mined from properties we do not own or lease, including the royalty rates under the lessee’s lease with us, mining\nconditions, mine operating costs, cost and availability of transportation, and customer specifications. In addition, lessees move on and off of our properties over the course of any\ngiven year in accordance with their mine plans. If a lessee satisfies its obligations to its customers with minerals from properties we do not own or lease, production on our properties\nwill decrease, and we will receive lower royalty revenues.\nA lessee may incorrectly report royalty revenues, which might not be identified by our lessee audit process or our mine inspection process or, if identified, might be identified in\na subsequent period.\nWe depend on our lessees to correctly report production and royalty revenues on a monthly basis. Our regular lessee audits and mine inspections may not discover any\nirregularities in these reports or, if we do discover errors, we might not identify them in the reporting period in which they occurred. Any undiscovered reporting errors could result in\na loss of royalty revenues and errors identified in subsequent periods could lead to accounting disputes as well as disputes with our lessees.\nBecause of the unique difficulties and uncertainties inherent in technology development, we face a risk of not being able to capitalize on our license or ownership of intellectual\nproperty.\nPotential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by companies developing new technology and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The\nlikelihood of our successful ability to commercialize intellectual property we own or license must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and\ndelays encountered in connection with the development of new technology with limited personnel and financial means. These potential problems include, but are not limited to,\nunanticipated technical problems that extend the time and cost of product development or unanticipated problems with the operation of the technology.\nTechnology development involves significant time and expense and can be uncertain.\nThe development of technology associated with our licensed or owned intellectual property will be costly, complex and time-consuming. Any investment\ninto technology development and commercialization often involves a long wait until a return, if any, is achieved on such investment. We plan to make investments in research and\ndevelopment relating to our owned and licensed intellectual property and technology. Investments in new technology and processes are inherently speculative.\n37\nTable of Contents\nSuccessful technical development of technologies associated with intellectual property does not guarantee successful commercialization.\nWe may successfully complete the technical development of technologies associated with our owned or licensed intellectual property, but we may still fail to commercialize\nthat technology at scale or at a cost attractive to the target industries. Our success will depend largely on our ability to prove the capabilities and cost-effectiveness of the developed\ntechnology. Upon demonstration, the technology may not have the capabilities they were designed to have or that we believed they would have, or they may be more expensive than\nanticipated. Furthermore, even if we do successfully demonstrate the technology’s capabilities, potential customers may be more comfortable doing business with a larger, more\nestablished, more proven company than us. Moreover, competing technologies may prevent us from gaining wide market acceptance of the technology. Significant revenue from new\ntechnology investments may not be achieved for a number of years, if at all.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, we could lose our ability to compete in the market.\nOur intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our ability to remain competitive and for the success of our products and our business. Our intellectual\nproperty rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or\nother trade secrets by employees or competitors. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop technologies and products that are substantially equivalent or superior to\nour technologies and/or products, which could result in decreased revenues. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same\nextent as the laws of the United States. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights which could result in substantial costs to us and substantial diversion\nof management attention. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, our competitors could use it to enhance their products. Our inability to adequately protect our\nintellectual property rights could adversely affect our business and financial condition, and the value of our brand and other intangible assets.\nOther companies may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, which could materially increase our costs and harm our ability to generate future revenue and profit.\nWe do not believe that we infringe the proprietary rights of any third party, but claims of infringement are becoming increasingly common, and third parties may assert\ninfringement claims against us. It may be difficult or impossible to identify, prior to receipt of notice from a third party, the trade secrets, patent position or other intellectual property\nrights of a third party, either in the United States or in foreign jurisdictions. Any such assertion may result in litigation or may require us to obtain a license for the intellectual\nproperty rights of third parties. If we are required to obtain licenses to use any third-party technology, we would have to pay royalties, which may significantly reduce any profit on\nour products. In addition, any such litigation could be expensive and disruptive to our ability to generate revenue or enter into new market opportunities. If any of our products were\nfound to infringe other parties’ proprietary rights and we are unable to come to terms regarding a license with such parties, we may be forced to modify our products to make them\nnon-infringing or to cease production of such products altogether.\nRisks Related to Environmental, Health, Safety and Other Regulations\nThe current U.S. administration and Congress could enact legislative and regulatory measures that could adversely affect our mining operations or cost structure or our\ncustomers’ ability to use coal, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn February 2021, the current administration announced reentry of the U.S. into the Paris Agreement along with a new \"nationally determined contribution” for U.S. GHG\nemissions that would achieve emissions reductions of at least 50% relative to 2005 levels by 2030. The U.S. participated in the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change 26th\nConference of the Parties (\"COP26”) held in Glasgow, Scotland in November 2021, advancing a Global Methane Pledge along with the European Union, which aims to cut global\nmethane pollution at least 30% by 2030 relative to 2020 levels, including \"all feasible reductions” in the energy sector. Since its formal launch at COP26, over 100 countries\nrepresenting almost 70% of global GDP have signed. Most recently, at the 27th conference of parties (\"COP27”),\n38\nTable of Contents\nPresident Biden announced the EPA’s proposed standards to reduce methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources, and agreed, in conjunction with the European Union and a\nnumber of other partner countries, to develop standards for monitoring and reporting methane emissions to help create a market for low methane-intensity natural gas. Various state\nand local governments have also publicly committed to furthering the goals of the Paris Agreement. The $1 trillion legislative infrastructure package passed by Congress in November\n2021 includes a number of climate-focused spending initiatives targeted at climate resilience, enhanced response and preparation for extreme weather events, and clean energy and\ntransportation investments. In August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 into law. The Inflation Reduction Act provides significant funding and\nincentives for research and development of low-carbon energy production methods, carbon capture, and other programs directed at addressing climate change. In addition, the Biden\nAdministration has taken measures to unwind a number of regulatory rollbacks enacted or proposed by the Trump administration, including, among others, the ACE Rule, the NWPR,\nand the proposed NEPA overhaul. In addition, the Biden administration rolled back certain changes to the CCR made by the Trump administration. In January 2022, the EPA\nannounced several actions with respect to the coal combustion residuals rules, including reiterating that surface impoundments cannot be closed with coal ash in contact with\ngroundwater (in connection with the proposed denial of closure deadline extensions due to failure of a permittee to demonstrate compliance with coal combustion residuals rules –\nthe EPA took final action to deny the request in November 2022) and establishing a federal permitting scheme for the disposal of coal ash and establish regulations for legacy coal\nash surface impoundments. New, more stringent legislation or regulations related to the protection of the environment, health and safety or the reduction of greenhouse gas\nemissions, as well as changes in the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations, may require us or our customers to change operations significantly or incur\nincreased costs, which may adversely affect our mining operations, cost structure or our customers’ ability to use coal. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nLaws and regulations restricting or encouraging the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as well as uncertainty concerning such regulations and increasing public attention\ntoward climate change could adversely impact the market for coal, increase our operating costs, and reduce the value of our coal assets and our stock price.\nClimate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. There is widespread concern about the contributions of human activity to such changes,\nespecially through the emission of GHGs. Numerous reports, such as Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, have further raised concern about\nthe impacts of fossil fuel combustion on global climate issues. There are three primary sources of GHGs associated with the coal industry. First, the end use of our coal by our\ncustomers in electricity generation, coke plants, and steelmaking is a source of GHGs. Second, combustion of fuel by equipment used in coal production and to transport our coal to\nour customers is a source of GHGs. Third, coal mining itself can release methane, which is considered to be a more potent GHG than carbon dioxide, directly into the atmosphere.\nThese emissions from coal consumption, transportation and production are subject to pending and proposed regulation as part of initiatives to address global climate change.\nAs a result, numerous proposals have been adopted, made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional, state and local levels of government\nto monitor and limit emissions of GHGs, including alternative energy requirements, measures promoting renewable energy development, and energy conservation and emissions\nreductions measures, among others. Collectively, these initiatives could result in higher electricity costs to our customers or lower the demand for coal used in electric or steel\ngeneration, which could in turn adversely impact our business. Such initiatives, as well as increasing public attention to climate change more generally, could also result in direct\nregulation of the GHGs produced by our operations or increase the potential for governmental investigations or litigation. See \"Business—Environmental and Other Regulatory\nMatters—Global Climate Change.”\nAt present, we are principally focused on metallurgical coal production, which is not used in connection with the production of power generation. However, we may seek to\nsell greater amounts of our coal into the power-generation market in the future. The market for our coal may be adversely impacted if comprehensive legislation or regulations\nfocusing on GHG emission reductions are adopted, or if our customers are unable to obtain financing for their operations. The extent of future regulation of GHG emissions may\ninhibit utilities from investing in the building of new coal-fired plants to replace older plants or investing in the upgrading of existing coal-fired plants. Any reduction in the amount of\ncoal consumed by electric power generators as a result of actual or potential regulation of GHG emissions, including any reductions resulting from power plants ceasing operations or\nswitching to fuels that produce fewer GHG\n39\nTable of Contents\nemissions, could decrease demand for our coal, thereby reducing our revenues and materially and adversely affecting our business and results of operations. We or prospective\ncustomers may also have to invest in carbon dioxide capture and storage technologies in order to burn coal and comply with future GHG emission standards, and new legislation,\nregulations or international agreements in the future could otherwise result in increased costs to operate and maintain our or our customers’ facilities, capital expenditures to install\nother emission controls at our or our customers’ facilities, and costs to administer and manage any potential climate-related reporting or greenhouse gas emissions trading or tax\nprograms. These costs and capital expenditures could be material and could increase the cost of and reduce demand for our products. Relatedly, to the extent others use or develop\nnew technological advances in coal production in response to market or regulatory pressures to reduce their impact on the environment, we may be placed at a competitive\ndisadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement new technologies at substantial costs. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or\nimplement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete, our business, financial\ncondition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. See also \"—Product alternatives or other technologies may reduce demand for our products.”\nCurrent and future laws, regulations and other legal requirements relating to protection of the environment and natural resources may increase our costs of doing business and\nmay restrict our coal operations.\nWe and our potential customers are subject to stringent and complex laws, regulations and other legal requirements enacted by federal, state and local authorities relating to\noccupational health and safety and protection of the environment and natural resources. These include those legal requirements that govern discharges or emissions of materials into\nthe environment, the management and disposal of substances and wastes, including hazardous wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites, threatened and endangered plant and\nwildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed, mitigation and restoration of streams or other waters, the protection of drinking water,\nassessment of the environmental impacts of mining, monitoring and reporting requirements, the installation of various safety equipment in our mines, remediation of impacts of\nsurface subsidence from underground mining, and work practices related to employee health and safety. See \"Business—Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters.” Examples\ninclude laws and regulations relating to:\n● occupational health and safety;\n● emissions to air and discharges to water;\n● plant and wildlife protection, including endangered species protections;\n● the reclamation and restoration of properties after mining or other activity has been completed;\n● limitations on land use;\n● mine permitting and licensing requirements;\n● the storage, treatment and disposal of wastes;\n● air quality standards;\n● water pollution;\n● protection of human health, plant-life and wildlife, including endangered and threatened species, and biodiversity;\n● protection of wetlands;\n● the discharge of materials into the environment;\n● remediation of contaminated soil, surface and groundwater; and\n● the effects of operations on surface water and groundwater quality and availability.\nComplying with these environmental and employee health and safety requirements, including the terms of our permits, has had, and will continue to have, a significant effect\non our costs of operations. In addition, there is the possibility that we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of environmental laws, judicial interpretations of or\nrulings on environmental laws or permits, or in connection with the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination. For example, the EPA and several of the states\nwhere we operate have, or intend to, propose revised recommended aquatic life criteria for discharges of selenium regulated under the CWA, which may be more stringent than\ncurrent criteria. The comment period for the EPA’s draft Selenium Technical Support Materials, intended to provide implementation support for states for the recommend selenium\naquatic life criterion for freshwater ended on\n40\nTable of Contents\nJanuary 3, 2022. Any additional laws, regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal, state and local authorities, or new interpretations of existing legal\nrequirements by regulatory bodies relating to the protection of the environment, including those related to discharges of selenium, could further affect our costs or limit our\noperations. See \"Business—Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters.”\nOur operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, and our properties may have environmental contamination, which could expose us to\nsignificant costs and liabilities.\nOur operations currently use hazardous materials and generate limited quantities of hazardous wastes from time to time. Drainage flowing from or caused by mining activities\ncan be acidic with elevated levels of dissolved metals, a condition referred to as \"acid mine drainage,” or may include other pollutants requiring treatment. We could become subject\nto claims for toxic torts, natural resource damages and other damages as well as for the investigation and clean-up of soil, surface water, groundwater, and other media. Such claims\nmay arise, for example, out of conditions at sites that we currently own or operate, as well as at sites that we previously owned or operated, or may acquire. Our liability for such\nclaims may be joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages, or for the entire share.\nWe maintain coal refuse areas and slurry impoundments as necessary. Such areas and impoundments are subject to extensive regulation. Structural failure of a slurry\nimpoundment or coal refuse area could result in extensive damage to the environment and natural resources, such as bodies of water that the coal slurry reaches, as well as liability for\nrelated personal injuries and property damages, and injuries to wildlife. If an impoundment were to fail, we could be subject to claims for the resulting environmental contamination\nand associated liability, as well as for fines and penalties. Our coal refuse areas and slurry impoundments are designed, constructed, and inspected by our company and by regulatory\nauthorities according to stringent environmental and safety standards.\nWe must obtain, maintain, and renew governmental permits and approvals for mining operations, which can be a costly and time-consuming process and result in restrictions\non our operations.\nNumerous governmental permits and approvals are required for mining operations. Our operations are principally regulated under permits issued pursuant to the SMCRA\nand the federal CWA. State and federal regulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance. Requirements imposed by these authorities\nmay be costly and time consuming and may result in delays in the commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations. In addition, we may be required to prepare\nand present to permitting or other regulatory authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that proposed exploration for or production of coal might have on the environment.\nOur coal production is dependent upon our ability to obtain various federal and state permits and approvals to mine our coal reserves. The permitting rules, and the\ninterpretations of these rules, are complex, change frequently, and are often subject to discretionary interpretations by regulators, all of which may make compliance more difficult or\nimpractical, and which may possibly preclude the continuance of ongoing mine development or operations or the development of future mining operations. The pace with which the\ngovernment issues permits needed for new operations and for ongoing operations to continue mining, particularly CWA permits, can be time-consuming and subject to delays and\ndenials. These delays or denials of environmental permits needed for mining could reduce our production and materially adversely impact our cash flow and results of operations.\nPrior to discharging any pollutants to waters of the United States, coal mining companies must obtain a NPDES permit from the appropriate state or federal permitting\nauthority. NPDES permits include effluent limitations for discharged pollutants and other terms and conditions, including required monitoring of discharges. Changes and proposed\nchanges in state and federally recommended water quality standards may result in the issuance or modification of permits with new or more stringent effluent limits or terms and\nconditions. See \"Business—Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters—Clean Water Act.”\nFurther, the public has certain statutory rights to comment on and submit objections to requested permits and environmental impact statements prepared in connection with\napplicable regulatory processes, and otherwise engage in\n41\nTable of Contents\nthe permitting process, including bringing citizens’ claims to challenge the issuance or renewal of permits, the validity of environmental impact statements or performance of mining\nactivities. As a result of challenges like these, the permits we need may not be issued or renewed in a timely fashion or issued or renewed at all, or permits issued or renewed may not\nbe maintained, may be challenged or may be conditioned in a manner that may restrict our ability to efficiently and economically conduct our mining activities, any of which would\nmaterially reduce our production, cash flow, and profitability.\nPermitting rules may also require, under certain circumstances, that we obtain surface-owner consent if the surface estate has been severed from the mineral estate. This\ncould require us to negotiate with third parties for surface access that overlies coal we acquired or intend to acquire. These negotiations can be costly and time-consuming, lasting\nyears in some instances, which can create additional delays in the permitting process. If we cannot successfully negotiate for land access, we could be denied a permit to mine coal\nwe already own.\nFederal or state regulatory agencies have the authority to order certain of our mines to be temporarily or permanently closed under certain circumstances, which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our ability to meet our customers’ demands.\nFederal or state regulatory agencies have the authority, under certain circumstances following significant health and safety incidents, such as fatalities, to order a mine to be\ntemporarily or permanently closed. If this occurred, we may be required to incur capital expenditures to re-open the mine. In the event that these agencies order the closing of our\nmines, our coal sales contracts generally permit us to issue force majeure notices which suspend our obligations to deliver coal under these contracts. However, our customers may\nchallenge our issuances of force majeure notices. If these challenges are successful, we may have to purchase coal from third-party sources, if it is available, to fulfill these\nobligations, incur capital expenditures to re-open the mines and/or negotiate settlements with the customers, which may include price reductions, the reduction of commitments, the\nextension of time for delivery or the termination of customers’ contracts. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur customers are subject to extensive existing and future laws, regulations and other legal requirements relating to protection of the environment, which could negatively\nimpact our business and the market for our products.\nCoal contains impurities, including sulfur, mercury, chlorine and other elements or compounds, many of which are released into the air when coal is burned. Complying with\nregulations to address these emissions can be costly for our customers. For example, in order to meet the CAA limits for sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power plants, coal users\nmust install costly pollution control devices, use sulfur dioxide emission allowances (some of which they may purchase), or switch to other fuels. More costly and stringent\nenvironmental regulations could adversely impact the operations of our customers, which could in turn adversely impact our business. A number of coal-fired power plants,\nparticularly smaller and older plants, already have retired or announced that they will retire rather than retrofit to meet the obligations of these rules.\nIn addition, considerable uncertainty is associated with new air emissions initiatives that may require significant emissions control expenditures for many coal-fired power\nplants. As a result, some of our prospective customers may switch to other fuels that generate fewer of these emissions or may install more effective pollution control equipment that\nreduces the need for low-sulfur coal. Any further switching of fuel sources away from coal, closure of existing coal-fired power plants, or reduced construction of new coal-fired\npower plants could have a material adverse effect on demand for, and prices received for, our coal. In addition, our coke plant and steelmaking customers may face increased\noperational costs as a result of higher electric costs. See \"Business—Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters.”\nApart from actual and potential regulation of air emissions and solid wastes from coal-fired plants, state and federal mandates for increased use of electricity from renewable\nenergy sources could have an impact on the market for our coal. Many states, including Pennsylvania and Virginia, have enacted legislative mandates requiring electricity suppliers\nto use renewable energy sources to generate a certain percentage of power. Possible advances in technologies and incentives, such as under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, to\nenhance the economics of renewable energy sources could make these sources more competitive with coal. Any reductions in the amount of coal consumed by electric power\ngenerators as a result of current or new standards for the emission of impurities, or current or new\n42\nTable of Contents\nincentives to switch to renewable fuels or renewable energy sources could reduce the demand for our coal, thereby reducing our revenues and adversely affecting our business, cash\nflows, results of operations and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nNegative sentiment with regard to our business or our industry as well as activism, consumer preferences, and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change or a reduction of air\npollutants could interfere with our business activities, operations and ability to access capital sources, result in reduced demand for our products, and negatively impact our\nstock price.\nPublic perception of our industry’s contribution to climate change or detractions from the transition to a lower-carbon economy has generated negative sentiment toward\nour industry and could result in reputational harm to our business, lower demand for our products, and increased demand for alternatives to our products. Numerous activist groups\nare devoting resources to anti-coal activities to minimize or eliminate the production of or use of coal as a source of electricity generation, domestically and internationally.\nParticipants in the coal mining industry are frequently targeted by activist groups that openly attempt to disrupt the industry. For example, Greenpeace International filed a letter with\nthe SEC alleging that one coal mining company’s filings relating to a proposed public offering of securities may contain incomplete and misleading disclosures regarding the risks of\ninvesting in the coal market. On another occasion, the Sierra Club sent a letter to the SEC stating that it believed a coal mining company may be giving potential investors false\nimpressions regarding risks to its business. Other groups have objected to our RAM No. 1 mine permit application in Pennsylvania. It is possible that we could continue to be the\ntarget of similar actions in the future, including when we attempt to grow our business through acquisitions or commence new mining operations. Activist groups have also brought\nlawsuits challenging the issuance of individual coal leases, historical and pending regulatory approvals, permits and processes that are necessary to conduct coal mining operations\nor to operate coal-fueled power plants. Negative public perception could cause the permits we require to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed or burdened by requirements\nthat restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of government entities and private individuals have sought to bring suit\nagainst fossil fuel companies, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to climate change or alleging that the\ncompanies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but failed to adequately disclose such impacts to their investors or customers. Private individuals\nor public entities may also seek to enforce laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury, property damages or other liabilities in relation to climate change or other\nESG matters. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could have an adverse impact on our financial condition. Any such activism could therefore materially and adversely impact our\nability to operate our business or raise capital.\nIn addition, there have also been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension\nfunds, universities and other groups, promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities; encouraging the consideration of environmental, social and governance (\"ESG”) practices and\nESG ratings of companies in a manner that may negatively affect coal companies, including increased negative investor sentiment, divestment of securities issued by coal companies\nand the diversion of investment to other industries; and also pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. For example, certain\nfinancial institutions, including banks and insurance companies, have taken actions to limit available financing, insurance and other services to entities that produce or use fossil\nfuels. Several large investment banks have adopted climate change guidelines for lenders. The guidelines require the evaluation of carbon risks in the financing of electric power\ngeneration plants, which may make it more difficult for utilities to obtain financing for coal-fired plants. The impact of such efforts and developments may adversely affect the demand\nfor and price of securities issued by us, adversely impact our access to the capital and financial markets, increase the cost of borrowing, cause a decline in our credit rating, increase\nthe cost or reduce the availability of third-party insurance, increase our retention of risk through self-insurance, and limit our flexibility and ability to conduct business development\nactivities. Further, in California, legislation was signed into law in September 2015 to require the state’s pension funds to divest investments in companies that generate 50% or more\nof their revenue from coal mining by July 2017. Additionally, Maine passed a law in June 2021 requiring the state pension system to divest holdings in coal, petroleum, natural gas\nand related products by 2026, and the New York State Common Retirement Fund has and is continuing to divest from coal assets. These efforts and developments, as well as\nconcerted conservation and efficiency efforts, could also cause coal prices and sales of our coal to materially decline and could cause our costs to increase.\n43\nTable of Contents\nOther activist campaigns have urged companies to cease financing coal-driven businesses. A number of investors and asset managers have enacted such policies as a\nresult, including by beginning to exit investments that present high sustainability-related risks, such as thermal coal producers. The impact of such efforts may adversely affect the\ndemand for and price of securities issued by us and impact our access to the capital and financial markets. In addition, several well-funded non-governmental organizations have\nexplicitly undertaken campaigns to minimize or eliminate mining and the use of coal as a source of electricity generation. The net effect of these developments is to make it more costly\nand difficult to maintain our business and to continue to depress the market for coal.\nOur mines are subject to stringent federal and state safety regulations that increase our cost of doing business at active operations and may place restrictions on our methods of\noperation. In addition, government inspectors in certain circumstances may have the ability to order our operations to be shut down based on safety considerations.\nThe MINE Act and MINER Act, and regulations issued under these federal statutes, impose stringent health and safety standards on mining operations. The regulations\nthat have been adopted under the MINE Act and the MINER Act are comprehensive and affect numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine personnel, mining\nprocedures, roof control, ventilation, blasting, use and maintenance of mining equipment, dust and noise control, communications, emergency response procedures, and other\nmatters. MSHA regularly inspects mines to ensure compliance with regulations promulgated under the MINE Act and MINER Act. In addition, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and\nVirginia all have similar programs for mine safety and health regulation and enforcement.\nThe various requirements mandated by federal and state statutes, rules, and regulations may place restrictions on our methods of operation and potentially result in fees and\ncivil penalties for violations of such requirements or criminal liability for the knowing violation of such standards, significantly impacting operating costs and productivity. In\naddition, government inspectors have the authority to issue orders to shut down our operations based on safety considerations under certain circumstances, such as imminent\ndangers, accidents, failures to abate violations, and unwarrantable failures to comply with mandatory safety standards. See \"Business—Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters\n—Mine Safety and Health.”\nThe regulations enacted under the MINE Act and MINER Act as well as under similar state acts are routinely expanded, raising compliance costs and increasing potential\nliability. These existing and other future mine safety rules could potentially result in or require significant expenditures, as well as additional safety training and planning, enhanced\nsafety equipment, more frequent mine inspections, stricter enforcement practices and enhanced reporting requirements. At this time, it is not possible to predict the full effect that\nnew or proposed statutes, regulations and policies will have on our operating costs, but any expansion of existing regulations, or making such regulations more stringent may have a\nnegative impact on the profitability of our operations. If we were to be found in violation of mine safety and health regulations, we could face penalties or restrictions that may\nmaterially and adversely impact our operations, financial results and liquidity.\nWe must also compensate employees for work-related injuries. State workers’ compensation acts typically provide for an exception to an employer’s immunity from civil\nlawsuits for workplace injuries in the case of intentional torts. In such situations, an injured worker would be able to bring suit against his or her employer for damages in excess of\nworkers’ compensation benefits. In addition, West Virginia’s workers’ compensation act provides a much broader exception to workers’ compensation immunity, allowing an injured\nemployee to recover against his or her employer if he or she can show damages caused by an unsafe working condition of which the employer was aware and that was a violation of a\nstatute, regulation, rule or consensus industry standard. These types of lawsuits are not uncommon and could have a significant effect on our operating costs.\nWe have obtained from a third-party insurer a workers’ compensation insurance policy, which includes coverage for medical and disability benefits for black lung disease\nunder the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 and the MINE Act. We perform periodic evaluations of our black lung liability, using assumptions regarding rates of\nsuccessful claims, discount factors, benefit increases and mortality rates, among others. Of note, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 significantly amended the\nblack lung provisions of the MINE Act by reenacting two provisions, which had been eliminated in 1981. Under the amendments, a miner with at least fifteen years of\n44\nTable of Contents\nunderground coal mine employment (or surface mine employment with similar dust exposure) who can prove that he suffers from a totally disabling respiratory condition is entitled to\na rebuttable presumption that his disability is caused by black lung. The other amendment provides that the surviving spouse of a miner who was collecting federal black lung\nbenefits at the time of his death is entitled to a continuation of those benefits. These changes could have a material impact on our costs expended in association with the federal black\nlung program.\nWe have reclamation, mine closing, and related environmental obligations under the SMCRA. If the assumptions underlying our accruals are inaccurate, we could be required\nto expend greater amounts than anticipated.\nThe SMCRA establishes operational, reclamation and closure standards for our mining operations. The SMCRA requires that comprehensive environmental protection and\nreclamation standards be met during the course of and following completion of mining activities. Permits for all mining operations must be obtained from the OSMRE or, where state\nregulatory agencies have adopted federally approved state programs under the SMCRA, the appropriate state regulatory authority. Our operations are located in states which have\nachieved primary jurisdiction for enforcement of the SMCRA through approved state programs. See \"Business—Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters.”\nIn addition, the SMCRA imposes a reclamation fee on all current mining operations, the proceeds of which are deposited in the AML Fund, which is used to restore\nunreclaimed and abandoned mine lands mined before 1977. The current per ton fee is $0.224 per ton for surface mined coal and $0.096 per ton for underground mined coal. These fees\nare currently scheduled to be in effect until September 30, 2034, and on November 15, 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (\"IIJA”), which included the Abandoned Mine\nLand Reclamation Amendments of 2021, extended OSMRE’s statutory authority to collect reclamation fees for an additional 13 years and to reduce the fee rates.\nWe accrue for the costs of current mine disturbance and of final mine closure, including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary. The amounts recorded\nare dependent upon a number of variables, including the estimated future closure costs, estimated proven reserves, assumptions involving profit margins, inflation rates, and the\nassumed credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates. If these accruals are insufficient or our liability in a particular year is greater than currently anticipated, our future operating results\ncould be adversely affected. We are also required to post bonds for the cost of a coal mine as a condition of our mining activities.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nOur ability to pay dividends on our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock may be limited by the amount of cash we generate from operations following the\npayment of fees and expenses, by restrictions in debt instruments and by additional factors unrelated to our profitability.\nWe have paid quarterly dividends in the past and may pay additional special and regular quarterly dividends in the future. Our ability to pay dividends is subject to the\ndiscretion of our board of directors and the requirements of applicable law. The timing and amount of dividends declared will depend on, among other things: (a) our earnings,\nearnings outlook, financial condition, production, processing and shipping levels, financial condition, cash flow, cash requirements and our outlook on current and future market\nconditions, (b) our liquidity, including our ability to obtain debt and equity financing on acceptable terms, (c) restrictive covenants in our Credit and Security Agreement (the \"Credit\nAgreement”) with KeyBank National Association, as the administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto, and any future debt instruments and (d) provisions of applicable law\ngoverning the payment of dividends.\nThe metallurgical coal industry is highly volatile, and we cannot predict with certainty the amount of cash, if any, that will be available for distribution as dividends in any\nperiod. Also, there may be a high degree of variability from period to period in the amount of cash, if any, that is available for the payment of dividends. The amount of cash we\ngenerate from operations and the actual amount of cash we will have available for dividends will vary based upon, among other things:\n● risks related to the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic, such as the scope and duration of the outbreak, the health and safety of our employees, government\nactions and restrictive measures\n45\nTable of Contents\nimplemented in response, delays and cancellations of customer sales, supply chain disruptions and other impacts to the business, or our ability to execute our\nbusiness continuity plans;\n● the development of our properties into producing coal mines;\n● the ability to begin generating significant revenues and operating cash flows;\n● the market price for coal;\n● overall domestic and global economic conditions, including the supply of and demand for domestic and foreign coal, coke and steel;\n● unexpected operational events or geological conditions;\n● cost overruns;\n● our ability to enter into agreements governing the sale of coal, which are generally short-term in nature and subject to fluctuations in market pricing;\n● the level of our operating costs;\n● prevailing global and regional economic and political conditions;\n● changes in interest rates;\n● the impact of domestic and foreign governmental laws and regulations, including environmental and climate change regulations and regulations affecting the coal\nmining industry;\n● delays in the receipt of, failure to receive, failure to maintain or revocation of necessary governmental permits;\n● modification or revocation of our dividend policy by our board of directors; and\n● the amount of any cash reserves established by our board of directors.\nThe amount of cash we generate from our operations may differ materially from our net income or loss for the period, which will be affected by non-cash items. We may incur\nother expenses or liabilities that could reduce or eliminate the cash available for distribution as dividends.\nIn addition, financing agreements may prohibit the payment of dividends if an event of default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a result of the payment of\nsuch dividends.\nIn addition, Section 170 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL”) allows our board of directors to declare and pay dividends on the shares of our Class A\ncommon stock and Class B common stock either (i) out of our surplus, as defined in and computed in accordance with the DGCL or (ii) in case there shall be no such surplus, out of\nour net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. We may not have sufficient surplus or net profits in the future to pay dividends,\nand our subsidiaries may not have sufficient funds, surplus or net profits to make distributions to us. As a result of these and the other factors mentioned above, we can give no\nassurance that dividends will be paid in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we ceased being an emerging growth company and, as a result, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional legal and\nfinancial compliance costs by complying with increased disclosure and governance requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2022, as a result of our market capitalization as of June 30, 2022, we became an accelerated filer and ceased being an emerging growth company.\nTherefore, we are subject to certain requirements that apply to other public companies but did not previously apply to us due to our status as an emerging growth company. These\nrequirements include:\n● the provisions of Section 404 requiring that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control\nover financial reporting;\n● the requirement to provide detailed compensation discussion and analysis in proxy statements and reports filed under the Exchange Act; and\n● the \"say on pay” provisions (requiring a non-binding stockholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive officers) and the \"say on golden parachute”\nprovisions (requiring a non-binding stockholder vote\n46\nTable of Contents\nto approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and certain other business combinations) of the Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act.\nWe have already incurred significant additional legal and financial compliance costs in connection with our loss of emerging growth company status. We expect that our\ncompliance with these additional requirements, including the provisions of Section 404, will continue to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some\nactivities more time consuming and costly.\nYour percentage of ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage of ownership in us may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including, without limitation,\nequity awards that we may be granting to our directors, officers and employees. Such issuances may have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the\nmarket price of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock.\nIt is anticipated that the compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company will grant additional equity awards to Company employees and directors, from\ntime to time, under the Company’s compensation and employee benefit plans. These additional awards will have a dilutive effect on the Company’s earnings per share, which could\nadversely affect the market price of the Company’s Class A common stock and Class B common stock.\nIn addition, our Charter authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers,\npreferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as our board of\ndirectors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our Class A common stock and\nClass B common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events\nor to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value\nof our Class A common stock and Class B common stock.\nCertain of our directors have significant duties with, and spend significant time serving, entities that may compete with us in seeking acquisitions and business opportunities\nand, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating time or pursuing business opportunities.\nCertain of our directors hold positions of responsibility with other entities (including Yorktown-affiliated entities) that are in the business of identifying and acquiring coal\nreserves. The existing positions held by these directors may give rise to fiduciary or other duties that are in conflict with the duties they owe to us. These directors may become aware\nof business opportunities that may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as to the other entities with which they are or may become affiliated. Due to these existing and\npotential future affiliations, they may present potential business opportunities to other entities prior to presenting them to us, which could cause additional conflicts of interest. They\nmay also decide that certain opportunities are more appropriate for other entities with which they are affiliated, and as a result, they may elect not to present those opportunities to us.\nThese conflicts may not be resolved in our favor.\nOur Charter and bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of\nour Class A common stock and Class B common stock.\nOur Charter authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more\ndifficult for a third-party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our Charter and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of us, even if the change\nof control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:\n47\nTable of Contents\n● limitations on the removal of directors;\n● limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;\n● establishing advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of\nstockholders;\n● providing that the board of directors is expressly authorized to adopt, or to alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n● establishing advance notice and certain information requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted\nupon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nOur Charter designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our\nstockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur Charter provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent\npermitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary\nduty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our\nCharter or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having\npersonal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. This exclusive forum provision does not apply to a cause of action brought under federal or state\nsecurities laws. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions\nof our Charter described in the preceding sentence. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for\ndisputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these\nprovisions of our Charter inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with\nresolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. Our systems and procedures for internal control over financial reporting and the\ndisclosure controls related to them have, and may have in the future, material weaknesses, which may adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nWe are responsible for maintaining systems and documentation necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. These activities may divert\nmanagement’s attention from other business concerns. As described in Part II, Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures” in this Annual Report, we have determined that certain of our\ninternal controls over financial reporting have material weaknesses. If we are unable to correct those issues in a timely fashion, or if other internal control issues arise, there could be a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and investors could lose confidence in our reported results, thus affecting our\nability to finance our business. To maintain and improve our controls and procedures, we must commit significant resources, may be required to hire additional staff and will need to\ncontinue to provide effective management oversight, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The\nmaterial weaknesses will not be considered remediated until enhanced controls are implemented and operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through\ntesting, that the related controls are effective. We can give no assurance that the measures we take to remediate the material weaknesses will be effective.\nRisks Related to Our Class B Common Stock Structure\nHolders of Class B common stock are common stockholders of the Company and, therefore, are subject to risks associated with an investment in the Company as a whole, even\nif a holder does not own shares of Class A common stock.\n48\nTable of Contents\nWe retain legal title to all of our assets and our tracking stock capitalization does not limit our legal responsibility, or that of our subsidiaries, for the liabilities included in any\nset of financial statement schedules. Holders of Class B common stock do not have any legal rights related to specific assets attributed to CORE and, in any liquidation, holders of\nClass B common stock and Class A common stock will be entitled to receive a pro rata share of our available net assets based on their respective numbers of shares.\nOur Board’s ability to reattribute businesses, assets and expenses between the Class A common stock and Class B common stock may make it difficult to assess the future\nprospects of a class of common stock based on past performance.\nOur Board currently expects to attribute 100% of the costs associated with the CORE Assets to Ramaco Resources and zero such costs to CORE; however, our Board is\nvested with discretion to reattribute businesses, assets and liabilities that are attributed to one class of common stock to another class of common stock, without the approval of any\nof our stockholders. Any such reattribution made by our Board, as well as the existence, in and of itself, of the right to effect a reattribution may impact the ability of investors to\nassess the future prospects of the businesses and assets attributed to a class of common stock, including liquidity and capital resource needs to pay the projected dividend to\nholders of our Class B common stock, based on past performance. Stockholders may also have difficulty evaluating the liquidity and capital resources of the businesses and assets\nattributed to each class of common stock based on past performance, as our Board may use the liquidity of one class to fund the liquidity of another class and capital expenditure\nrequirements through the use of loans and interests between classes.\nWe could be required to use assets attributed to one class of common stock to pay liabilities attributed to another class.\nThe assets attributed to one class are potentially subject to the liabilities attributed to another class, even if those liabilities arise from lawsuits, contracts or indebtedness\nthat are attributed to such other class. No provision of our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \"Amended Charter”) prevents us from satisfying liabilities\nof one class with assets of another class, and our creditors will not in any way be limited by our tracking stock capitalization from proceeding against any assets they could have\nproceeded against if we did not have a tracking stock capitalization.\nDividends on our Class B common stock are discretionary and may fluctuate materially quarter to quarter. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to pay dividends in the\nfuture or what the actual dividends will be for any future periods.\nOur ability to pay dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board, the requirements of applicable law, any statutory or contractual restrictions on the payment of\ndividends, any prior rights and preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding preferred stock and commercial factors, whether or not attributable to the CORE Assets. We\nmay lack sufficient cash to pay dividends to our Class B stockholders due to cash flow shortfalls attributable to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as\nincreases in corporate level general and administrative expenses, principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt, tax expenses, working capital requirements and anticipated\ncash needs. The timing and amount of dividends declared in future periods will depend on, among other things, (a) our earnings, earnings outlook, production, processing and\nshipping levels, financial condition, cash flow, cash requirements and our outlook on current and future market conditions, (b) our overall liquidity, (c) the restrictive covenants in the\nSecond Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement and any future debt instruments that we may enter into and (d) provisions of applicable law governing the dividends.\nWe have not established a minimum dividend payment for any class of our Common Stock, including our Class B common stock. Further our ability to pay and the amount of\ndividends declared in future periods may be harmed by other risk factors described herein and incorporated by reference herein. Our ability to pay dividends may fluctuate materially\nfrom quarter to quarter, and any quarterly estimate is subject to uncertainty due to the factors described above and elsewhere herein.\n49\nTable of Contents\nThe market price of the Class B common stock may not reflect the performance of CORE attributed to it, as we intend.\nWe cannot assure the holders of Class B common stock that the market price of the Class B common stock related to CORE will, in fact, reflect the performance of CORE\nattributed to it. Holders of Class B common stock are common stockholders of the Company as a whole and, as such, are subject to all risks associated with an investment in the\nCompany and all of our businesses, assets and liabilities. As a result, the market price of Class B common stock may, in part, reflect events that are intended to be reflected by the\nClass A common stock of the Company. In addition, investors may discount the value of Class B common stock because it is part of a common enterprise rather than a stand-alone\nentity.\nThe market price of the Class B common stock has been volatile, has fluctuated substantially, and could be affected by factors that do not affect traditional common stock.\nTo the extent the market price of the Class B common stock tracks the performance of more focused classes of businesses and assets than our Class A common stock does,\nthe market price of the Class B common stock may be more volatile than the market price of our existing common stock has been historically. The market price of the Class B common\nstock may be materially affected by, among other things:\n● actual or anticipated fluctuations CORE’s operating results;\n● potential acquisition activity by the Company (regardless of the class to which it is attributed) or the companies in which we invest;\n● issuances of debt or equity securities to raise capital by the Company or the companies in which we invest and the manner in which that debt or the proceeds of an\nequity issuance are attributed to each of the classes;\n● changes in financial estimates by securities analysts regarding the Class B common stock, the Class A common stock or CORE attributable to the Class B common\nstock;\n● the complex nature and the potential difficulties investors may have in understanding the terms of our new tracking stock, as well as concerns regarding the possible\neffect of certain of those terms on an investment in our stocks; and\n● general market conditions.\nUntil an orderly trading market develops for the Class B common stock, the trading price of the Class B common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market value of the Class B common stock could be adversely affected by events involving the other assets and businesses of the Company.\nBecause we are the issuer of the Class B common stock, an adverse market reaction to events relating to any of our assets and businesses, such as earnings announcements\nor announcements of new products or services, acquisitions or dispositions that the market does not view favorably, may cause an adverse market reaction in a particular class of\ncommon stock. This could occur even if the triggering event is not material to us as a whole. Certain events may also have a greater impact on one class than the same triggering\nevent would have on another class due to the asset composition of the affected class. In addition, the incurrence of significant indebtedness by us or any of our subsidiaries on\nbehalf of one class, including indebtedness incurred or assumed in connection with acquisitions of or investments in businesses, could affect our credit rating and that of our\nsubsidiaries and, therefore, could increase the borrowing costs of businesses attributable to our other classes or the borrowing costs of the Company as a whole.\n50\nTable of Contents\nWe may not pay dividends equally or at all on our classes of common stock.\nWe have the right to pay dividends on the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock in equal or unequal amounts, and we may pay dividends on one\nclass of common stock and not pay dividends on another class. In addition, any dividends or distributions on, or repurchases of, shares relating to a class will reduce our assets\nlegally available to be paid as dividends on another class.\nOur tracking stock capital structure could create conflicts of interest, and our Board may make decisions that could adversely affect only the holders of one class of our\ncommon stock.\nOur tracking stock capital structure could give rise to occasions when the interests of holders of one class of common stock might diverge or appear to diverge from the\ninterests of holders of another class of common stock. Our Class B common stock is not issued by a separate entity and thus holders of Class B common stock do not have the right\nto elect a separate board of directors. As a result, the Company’s officers and directors owe fiduciary duties to the Company as a whole and all of our stockholders as opposed to\nonly holders of a particular class of common stock. Decisions deemed to be in the best interest of the Company and all of our stockholders may not be in the best interest of a\nparticular class of common stock when considered independently. Examples include:\n● decisions as to the terms of any business relationships between classes of common stock;\n● the terms of any reattributions of assets between classes of common stock;\n● decisions as to the allocation of consideration among the holders of Class B common stock and Class A common stock to be received in connection with a merger\ninvolving the Company;\n● decisions as to the allocation of corporate opportunities between the classes, especially where the opportunities might meet the strategic business objectives of both\nclasses;\n● decisions as to operational and financial matters that could be considered detrimental to one class but beneficial to the other;\n● decisions as to the conversion of shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock;\n● decisions regarding the creation of, and, if created, the subsequent increase or decrease of any interest that one class of common stock may own in the other class of\ncommon stock;\n● decisions as to the internal or external financing attributable to businesses or assets attributed to any of our classes of common stock;\n● decisions as to the dispositions of assets of any of our classes of common stock; and\n● decisions as to the payment of dividends on any of our classes of common stock.\nOur directors’ or officers’ equity ownership may create or appear to create conflicts of interest.\nIf directors or officers own disproportionate interests (in percentage or value terms) in Class A common stock or Class B common stock, that disparity could create or appear\nto create conflicts of interest when they are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the holders of Class A common stock or Class B common stock.\nWe have not adopted any specific procedures for consideration of matters involving a divergence of interests among holders of Class A common stock or Class B common\nstock. Rather than develop additional specific procedures in advance, our Board intends to exercise its judgment from time to time, depending on the circumstances, as to how best\nto:\n51\nTable of Contents\n● obtain information regarding the divergence (or potential divergence) of interests;\n● determine under what circumstances to seek the assistance of outside advisers;\n● determine whether a committee of our Board should be appointed to address a specific matter and the appropriate members of that committee; and\n● assess what is in the Company’s best interests and the best interests of all of our stockholders.\nOur Board believes the advantage of retaining flexibility in determining how to fulfill its responsibilities in any such circumstances as they may arise outweighs any\nperceived advantages of adopting additional specific procedures in advance.\nOur Board does not expect to formally adopt any management or allocation policies with respect to the CORE Assets.\nThe Board does not expect to formally adopt any management or allocation policies with respect to the CORE Assets to serve as guidelines in making decisions regarding\nthe relationship between the Company’s overall business and CORE with respect to matters such as tax liabilities and benefits, loans between the two, attribution of assets, financing\nalternatives, corporate opportunities and similar items. Such determinations are in the sole discretion of our Board and our Board may at any time change or make exceptions to the\nrelationship between CORE and Ramaco Resources. A decision to change, or make exceptions to, these arrangements could disadvantage one class of stockholder while advantaging\nthe other.\nHolders of a class of common stock may not have any remedies if any action by our directors or officers has an adverse effect on only that class of common stock.\nPrinciples of applicable law and the provisions of our Amended Charter may protect decisions of our Board that have a disparate impact upon a particular class of common\nstock. Under applicable law, our Board has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders, regardless of the class of stock, or series, they hold.\nPrinciples of applicable law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a Board owes an equal duty to all stockholders and\ndoes not have separate or additional duties to any subset of stockholders. Judicial opinions in Delaware involving tracking stocks have established that decisions by directors or\nofficers involving differing treatment of holders of tracking stocks may be judged under the business judgment rule. In some circumstances, our directors or officers may be required\nto make a decision that is viewed as adverse to the holders of a particular series of that stock. Under the principles of applicable law and the business judgment rule referred to above,\nthe holders of Class B common stock may not be able to successfully challenge decisions that they believe have a disparate impact upon the stockholders of one of our classes if a\nmajority of our Board is disinterested and independent with respect to the action taken, is adequately informed with respect to the action taken and acts in good faith and in the\nhonest belief that our Board is acting in the best interest of the Company and all of our stockholders.\nStockholders will not vote on how to attribute consideration received in connection with a merger involving the Company among holders of Class A common stock and Class B\ncommon stock.\nOur Amended Charter does not contain any provisions governing how consideration received in connection with a merger or consolidation involving the Company is to be\nto the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, and none of the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will have a separate class vote in\nthe event of such a merger or consolidation. Consistent with applicable principles of applicable law, our Board will seek to divide the type and amount of consideration received in a\nmerger or consolidation involving the Company among holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock in a fair manner. As the different ways our Board may divide the\nconsideration between holders of the different classes of stock might have materially different results, the consideration to be received by holders of Class B common stock in any\nsuch merger or consolidation may be materially less valuable than the consideration they would have received if they had a separate class vote on such merger or consolidation.\n52\nTable of Contents\nWe may dispose of assets of CORE without the approval of the Class B common stockholders.\nApplicable law requires stockholder approval only for a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company taken as a whole, and our Amended\nCharter does not require a separate class vote in the case of a sale of a significant amount of assets attributed to any of our classes of common stock. As long as the assets attributed\nto a certain class of common stock proposed to be disposed of represent less than substantially all of our assets, we may approve sales and other dispositions of any amount of the\nassets of such class without any stockholder approval.\nOur Board will decide, in its sole discretion, how to proceed and is not required to select the option that would result in the highest value to holders of any particular class of\nstock.\nHolders of Class B common stock may receive less consideration upon a sale of the assets attributed to that class than if that class were a separate company.\nIf CORE was a separate, independent company and its shares were acquired by another person, certain costs of that sale, including corporate level taxes, might not be\npayable in connection with that acquisition. As a result, stockholders of a separate, independent company with the same assets might receive a greater amount of proceeds than the\nholders of Class B common stock would receive upon a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of CORE. In addition, we cannot assure the holders of Class B common stock that\nin the event of such a sale the per share consideration to be paid to holders of Class B common stock will be equal to or more than the per share value of that share of stock prior to or\nafter the announcement of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of CORE. Further, there is no requirement that the consideration paid be tax-free to the holders of Class B\ncommon stock. Accordingly, if we sell all or substantially all of the assets attributed to CORE, our Class B stockholders could suffer a loss in the value of their investment in our\nClass B common stock.\nIn the event of a liquidation of Ramaco Resources, holders of Class B common stock will not have a priority with respect to the assets attributed to CORE remaining for\ndistribution to stockholders.\nUnder the Amended Charter, upon Ramaco Resources’ liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will be entitled\nto receive, in respect of their shares of such stock, their proportionate interest in all of Ramaco Resources’ assets, if any, remaining for distribution to holders of common stock in\nproportion to their respective number of shares. Hence, the assets to be distributed to a holder of either class of common stock upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of\nRamaco Resources will have nothing to do with the value of the assets attributed to the class of common stock or to changes in the relative value of the Class B common stock over\ntime.\nOur Board may, in its sole discretion, elect to convert the Class B common stock to Class A common stock, thereby changing the nature of an investment in the Class B common\nstock and possibly diluting the economic interest in the Company of Class B common stock holders, which could result in a loss in value to such holders.\nOur Amended Charter permits our Board, in its sole discretion, to convert all of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock based\non an exchange ratio determined by a 20-day trailing VWAP for each class of stock. A conversion would preclude the holders of Class B common stock from retaining their\ninvestment in a security that is intended to reflect separately the performance of CORE. We cannot predict the impact on the market value of our stock of (1) our Board’s ability to\neffect any such conversion or (2) the exercise of this conversion right by our Board. In addition, our Board may effect such a conversion at a time when the market value of our\ndifferent stocks could cause the stockholders of one group to be disadvantaged.\nHolders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together and have limited separate voting rights.\nHolders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class, except in certain limited circumstances prescribed under applicable law. When\nholders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class, holders having a majority of the votes will be in a position to control the outcome of\n53\nTable of Contents\nthe vote even if the matter involves a conflict of interest among our stockholders or has a greater impact on one class than another.\nTransactions in Class B common stock by our insiders could depress the market price of those stocks.\nSales of, or hedging transactions such as collars relating to, shares of Class B common stock by any of our directors or executive officers, could cause a perception in the\nmarketplace that the stock price of the Class B common stock has peaked or that adverse events or trends have occurred or may be occurring at the Company or with respect to the\nClass B common stock. This perception can result notwithstanding any personal financial motivation for these transactions. As a result, insider transactions could depress the market\nprice for shares of the Class B common stock.\nOur capital structure, as well as the fact that CORE is not an independent company, may inhibit or prevent acquisition bids for CORE attributed to the Class B common stock\nand may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nIf CORE were a separate independent company, any person interested in acquiring CORE without negotiating with management could seek control of that class by obtaining\ncontrol of its outstanding voting stock, by means of a tender offer or a proxy contest. Although we intend Class B common stock to reflect the separate economic performance of\nCORE, it is not a separate entity, and a person interested in acquiring that class of common stock without negotiation with our management could obtain control of that class only by\nobtaining control of a majority in voting power of all of the outstanding voting shares of the Company. The existence of different classes of common stock could present complexities\nand in certain circumstances pose obstacles, financial and otherwise, to an acquiring person that are not present in companies that do not have a capital structure similar to ours.\nCertain provisions of our Amended Charter and bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of the Company that a stockholder may consider favorable.\nThese provisions include:\n● authorizing a capital structure with multiple classes of common stock: a Class A common stock and Class B common stock;\n● classifying our Board with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our Board;\n● prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n● limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n● establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at\nstockholder meetings;\n● requiring stockholder approval by holders of at least 66 2/3% of our aggregate voting power with respect to certain extraordinary matters, such as an amendment to our\nAmended Charter (excluding amendments to Section 4.1 thereof) or bylaws, and the approval by holders of at least 75% of our aggregate voting power for the removal\nof a director; and\n● the existence of authorized and unissued stock, including \"blank check” preferred stock, which could be issued by our Board to persons friendly to our then current\nmanagement, thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of the\nCompany.\n54\nTable of Contents\nGeneral Risk Factors\nChanges in tax legislation could have an adverse impact on our cash tax liabilities, results of operations or financial condition.\nTax legislation enacted in 2017 reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and included certain other changes that resulted in a significant reduction of our\nincome tax liability. Congress could, in the future, revise or repeal those changes or enact other tax law changes, such as the elimination of tax preferences currently available with\nrespect to coal exploration and development and the percentage depletion allowance. For example, President Biden has proposed increasing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 28%.\nWe are unable to predict whether any such changes will ultimately be enacted, but any such changes could have a material impact on our cash tax liabilities, results of operations or\nfinancial condition.\nDebt we incur in the future may limit our flexibility to obtain financing and to pursue other business opportunities.\nOur future level of debt could have important consequences to us, including the following:\n● our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures or other purposes may be impaired, or such financing may not be\navailable on favorable terms;\n● our funds available for operations and future business opportunities will be reduced by that portion of our cash flow required to make interest payments on our\ndebt;\n● our ability to pay dividends if an event of default occurs and is continuing or would occur as a result of paying such dividend;\n● we may be more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally; and\n● our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions may be limited.\nOur ability to service our debt will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic\nconditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service any future indebtedness,\nwe will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying our business activities, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets or issuing equity. We may not be able to\naffect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all.\nThe terms of the indenture governing our Senior Notes and the agreements and instruments governing our other indebtedness, including the Credit Agreement, and surety\nbonding obligations impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe indenture governing our Senior Notes and the agreements governing our other indebtedness, including the Credit Agreement, and surety bonding obligations contain\ncertain restrictions and covenants which restrict our ability to incur liens and/or debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of any other person and other restrictions, all of\nwhich could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity, and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThese covenants limit, among other things, our ability to:\n● incur additional indebtedness;\n● pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of stock or make certain other restricted payments, such as share repurchases;\n● make capital investments;\n● enter into agreements that restrict distributions from certain subsidiaries;\n● sell or otherwise dispose of assets;\n● use for general purposes the cash received from certain allowable asset sales or disposals;\n55\nTable of Contents\n● enter into transactions with affiliates;\n● create or incur liens;\n● merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets; and\n● receive dividends or other payments from subsidiaries in certain cases.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and we may need to refinance existing debt in the future. A breach of any of the\ncovenants under the indenture together with the expiration of any cure period, if applicable, could result in a default under our indenture. If any such default occurs, subject to\napplicable grace periods, the holders of our Senior Note may elect to declare all outstanding Senior Notes, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be\nimmediately due and payable. If the obligations under our Senior Notes were to be accelerated, our financial resources may be insufficient to repay the Senior Notes and any other\nindebtedness becoming due in full.\nIn addition, if we breach the covenants in the indenture governing the Senior Notes and do not cure such breach within the applicable time periods specified therein, we\nwould cause an event of default under the indenture governing the Senior Notes and a cross-default to certain of our other indebtedness and the lenders or holders thereunder could\naccelerate their obligations. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our indebtedness or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain\nnew financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our indebtedness is in default for any reason, our business, financial condition\nand results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our\nbusiness strategy and compete against companies who are not subject to such restrictions.\nThe number and quantity of viable financing and insurance alternatives available to us may be significantly impacted by unfavorable lending and investment policies by\nfinancial institutions and insurance companies associated with concerns about environmental impacts of coal combustion, and negative views around our efforts with respect to\nenvironmental and social matters and related governance considerations could harm the perception of our company by a significant number of investors or result in the\nexclusion of our securities from consideration by those investors.\nCertain banks, other financing sources and insurance companies have taken actions to limit available financing and insurance coverage for the development of new coal-\nfueled power plants and coal producers and utilities that derive a majority of their revenue from coal, and particularly from thermal coal. This may adversely impact the future global\ndemand for coal. Increasingly, the actions of such financial institutions and insurance companies are informed by non-standardized \"sustainability” scores, ratings and benchmarking\nstudies provided by various organizations that assess environmental, social and governance matters. Further, there have been efforts in recent years by members of the general\nfinancial and investment communities, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other institutional investors, to divest\nthemselves and to promote the divestment of securities issued by companies involved in the fossil fuel extraction market, or that have low ratings or scores in studies and\nassessments of the type noted above, including coal producers. These entities also have been pressuring lenders to limit financing available to such companies. These efforts may\nhave adverse consequences, including, but not limited to:\n● restricting our ability to access capital and financial markets in the future;\n● reducing the demand and price for our equity securities;\n● increasing the cost of borrowing;\n● causing a decline in our credit ratings;\n● reducing the availability, and/or increasing the cost of, third-party insurance;\n● increasing our retention of risk through self-insurance;\n● making it more difficult to obtain surety bonds, letters of credit, bank guarantees or other financing; and\n● limiting our flexibility in business development activities such as mergers, acquisitions and divestitures.\n56\nTable of Contents\nIf securities or industry analysts adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could\ndecline.\nThe trading market for our common stock could be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us or our business. If one or\nmore of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock\nprice or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrade our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations,\nour stock price could decline.\nOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.\nThe loss of our senior executives could have a material adverse effect on our business. There may be a limited number of persons with the requisite experience and skills to\nserve in our senior management positions. We may not be able to locate or employ qualified executives on acceptable terms. In addition, as our business develops and expands, we\nbelieve that our future success will depend greatly on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel with coal industry experience. We may not be able to\ncontinue to employ key personnel or attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Our failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability\nto effectively operate our business.\nWe could fail to retain customers or gain new ones.\nThe failure to obtain additional customers or the loss of all or a portion of the revenues attributable to any customer as a result of competition, creditworthiness, inability to\nnegotiate extensions or replacement of contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability\nto pay dividends to our stockholders.\nTerrorist attacks or cyber-incidents could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nLike most companies, we have become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services,\nto operate our businesses, process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our business partners, analyze mine and mining information, estimate quantities of coal\nreserves, as well as other activities related to our businesses. Strategic targets, such as energy-related assets, may be at greater risk of future terrorist or cyber-attacks than other\ntargets in the United States. Deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in, our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure of third parties, including systems that\ncollect, organize, store or use personal data, or cloud-based applications could lead to corruption or loss of our proprietary data and potentially sensitive data, delays in production or\ndelivery, difficulty in completing and settling transactions, challenges in maintaining our books and records, environmental damage, communication interruptions, other operational\ndisruptions and third-party liability. Due to the nature of cyber-attacks, breaches to our or our service or equipment providers’ systems could go unnoticed for a prolonged period of\ntime. Our insurance may not protect us against such occurrences. Consequently, it is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, as cyber incidents continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional\nresources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents.\nFailure to adequately protect critical data and technology systems and the impact of data privacy regulation could materially affect us.\nInformation technology solution failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by causing delays or canceling or impeding\nprocessing of transactions and reporting financial results, resulting in the unintentional disclosure of employee, royalty owner, or other third party or our confidential information, or\ndamage to our reputation. There can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, results\nof operations or cash flows. In addition, new laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information pose increasingly\n57\nTable of Contents\ncomplex compliance challenges and potentially elevate costs, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations (or contractual provisions requiring similar compliance) could\nresult in significant penalties and legal liability, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect our business. As\nnoted above, we are also subject to the possibility of cyber incidents or attacks, which themselves may result in a violation of these laws or may result in significant expense.\nWe may be subject to litigation, the disposition of which could negatively affect our profitability and cash flow in a particular period, or have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations\nOur profitability or cash flow in a particular period could be affected by an adverse ruling in any litigation that may be filed against us in the future. In addition, such\nlitigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \"Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings.”\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nAs discussed earlier under General Risk Factors, we have become increasingly dependent upon technology, including information systems as well as infrastructure and\ncloud applications and services. These technologies are used to operate our businesses, process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our business partners,\nanalyze mining information, estimate quantities of coal reserves, and perform other activities related to our business.\nRamaco uses third parties to manage its information technology (\"IT”) infrastructure. The Company’s process for assessing, identifying, and managing material\ncybersecurity risks includes the following activities, all of which are performed or assisted by third parties with considerable experience providing managed IT and security services\nor IT assurance services:\n● Assessment of cybersecurity risks, using the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework as a guide, as part of the overall IT risk\nassessment performed annually;\n● Network operations center monitoring to establish baseline metrics and assist with anomaly detection;\n● Periodic vulnerability scanning;\n● Configuration of firewall, antivirus, and malware protection as well as alert thresholds;\n● Generation of system audit logs and recovery backups;\n● Preparation of an incident response plan and assignment of team members;\n● Logical access security reviews for applications and data protection; and\n● Awareness training for employees on cybersecurity threats and safe practices.\nThe Company also uses applications hosted by a reputable third party that are critical to managing Ramaco’s business and financial records. The process to oversee and\nidentify cyber risks associated with the third-party service provider involves reviewing its annual System and Organization Controls 2 (\"SOC 2”), Type 2 Report as well as conducting\nrecurring status meetings with the third party.\nThe responsibility for managing and assessing material risks from cybersecurity threats lies with the Company’s IT Steering Committee, which is made up of five members of\nsenior management having legal or corporate finance backgrounds. The committee also includes one lead representative of the third-party IT management and security service\nproviders utilized by the Company to mitigate cybersecurity risks as discussed above. The IT Steering Committee met at least on a quarterly basis during 2023 and intends to meet\nmonthly going forward. Information regarding cybersecurity risks and mitigation efforts is reported periodically by the IT Steering Committee to the Company’s chief executive\nofficer, chief financial officer, and Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is primarily responsible for the Board of Directors’ oversight of cybersecurity risks.\n58\nTable of Contents\nWe have not experienced any cybersecurity incidents to date that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s business strategy,\nresults of operations, or financial condition. However, cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, and we may not be successful in preventing or mitigating a cybersecurity\nincident despite our efforts to protect against such risks. A successful cyberattack could lead to theft of sensitive information, ransomware, destruction of data, or other issues\ncausing financial, legal, or reputational damage. These events are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial\ncondition, should they occur.\nItem 2. Properties\nSummary Overview of Mining Operations\nInformation concerning our mining properties in this Annual Report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K, which\nrequires us to disclose our mineral resources, in addition to our mineral reserves, as of the end of our most recently completed fiscal year both in the aggregate and for each of our\nindividually material mining properties.\nAs used in this Annual Report, the terms \"mineral resource,” \"measured mineral resource,” \"indicated mineral resource,” \"inferred mineral resource,” \"mineral reserve,”\n\"proven mineral reserve” and \"probable mineral reserve” are defined and used in accordance with subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. Under subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K, mineral\nresources may not be classified as \"mineral reserves” unless the determination has been made by a qualified person that the indicated and measured mineral resources can be the\nbasis of an economically viable project. You are specifically cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral resources will ever be converted into mineral reserves, as\ndefined by the SEC. See \"Item 1A \"Risk Factors”\nYou are cautioned that, except for that portion of mineral resources classified as mineral reserves, mineral resources do not have demonstrated economic value. Inferred\nmineral resources are estimates based on limited geological evidence and sampling and have a too high of a degree of uncertainty as to their existence to apply relevant technical and\neconomic factors likely to influence the prospects of economic extraction in a manner useful for evaluation of economic viability. Estimates of inferred mineral resources may not be\nconverted to a mineral reserve. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. A significant amount of exploration\nmust be completed in order to determine whether an inferred mineral resource may be upgraded to a higher category. Therefore, you are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of\nan inferred mineral resource exists, that it can be the basis of an economically viable project, or that it will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Likewise, you are cautioned not to\nassume that all or any part of measured or indicated mineral resources will ever be converted to mineral reserves. See \"Item 1A \"Risk Factors”\nThe information that follows relating to the Elk Creek Complex, Berwind Complex, and Knox Creek Complex is derived, for the most part, from, and in some instances is an\nextract from, the technical report summaries (\"TRS”) relating to such properties prepared in compliance with the Item 601(b)(96) and subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. Portions of the\nfollowing information are based on assumptions, qualifications and procedures that are not fully described herein. Reference should be made to the full text of the TRSs, incorporated\nherein by reference and made a part of this Annual Report.\n59\nTable of Contents\nItem 2 Properties, Figure 1 below shows the location of our mining properties and offices as of December 31, 2023:\n60\nTable of Contents\nAt December 31, 2023, we had five mining properties, as summarized in the table below (tons produced in 000s), excluding the Brook Mine property:\nClean Tons Clean Tons Clean Tons\nControlled Produced Produced Produced Processing Facilities -\nLocation Acres Yrs Stage 2021 2022 2023 Mine Type Quality Transportation\nE Cl ok\nm\nC pr le ee xk L Mog ina gn o, W Coy uo nm tii en sg\n,\n,\nW\nan Vd\n20,200 20+ Production 1,981 2,033 2,031\nHiU ghn wde ar lg l,r o Suu rn fd a,\nce\nHi Agh\n,\nAV /o Bl ,a t Bile Elk Cre Cek\nS\nXP r Re Rpa\n,\nr Tat ri uo cn\nk\nPlant -\nMcDowell County, WV,\nBerwind Underground, Low and Mid Berwind Preparation Plant -\nBuchanan and Tazewell 62,500 20+ Production 180 416 601\nComplex Highwall, Surface Volatile Truck, Norfolk Southern RR\nCounties, VA\nMcDowell County, WV,\nKnox Creek Underground, Mid and High Knox Creek Preparation Plant -\nBuchanan, Russell, and 64,050 15 Production 45 235 370\nComplex Highwall, Surface Volatile A Truck, Norfolk Southern RR\nTazewell Counties, VA\nMaben Wyoming and Raleigh Underground, Berwind Preparation Plant -\n28,000 18 Production — — 172 Low Volatile\nComplex Counties, WV Highwall, Surface Truck, Norfolk Southern RR\nCommercial\nWashington County, High Volatile\nRAM Mine 1,567 n/a Development or — — — Underground Truck, Barge\nPA C\nOther\nTotal 176,317 2,206 2,684 3,174\nAt December 31, 2023, we owned or controlled, primarily through long-term leases, approximately 174,750 acres of coal in Virginia and West Virginia and 1,567 acres of coal in\nPennsylvania. The aggregate annual production for our properties during the three most recently completed fiscal years are as follows: 3.2 million tons for fiscal year 2023, 2.7 million\ntons for fiscal year 2022, and 2.2 million tons for fiscal year 2021. Our preparation plants and loadout facilities are located on properties owned by us or held under leases which expire\nat varying dates over the next 30 years. Most of the leases contain options to renew. Many of these leases provide for a royalty payment to the lessor based on a specific price per\nton of coal extracted or as a percentage of coal sales revenue. We believe that all of our leases were entered into at market terms.\nThe Company leases office space in Lexington, Kentucky that serves as its executive headquarters. In addition, the Company owns office space in Charleston, West Virginia\nthat serves as an operations center. The Company also owns offices in Sheridan, Wyoming. See Item 1. \"Business - Our Projects” for additional information about our mining\noperations and CORE initiatives.\nWe hold numerous environmental and mineral extraction permits, water rights and other permits, licenses and approvals from governmental authorities authorizing\noperations at each of our facilities. With respect to each facility at which we produce coal, permits, licenses and approvals are obtained as needed in the normal course of business\nbased on our mine plans and federal, state, and local regulatory provisions regarding mine permitting and licensing. Based on our historical permitting experience, we expect to be able\nto continue to obtain necessary mining permits and approvals to support historical rates of production.\nWe are the operators of the mining and processing operations and the mining methods we use consist of surface, underground and highwall mining methods. The mining\noperations for the Elk Creek, Berwind, and Knox Creek complexes are material to our business and are further described below.\n61\nTable of Contents\nElk Creek Complex\nThe Elk Creek Complex is located approximately 45 miles south of Charleston, West Virginia, in Logan, Wyoming, and Mingo Counties at N 37.698718, W 81.778297. The\nnearest town is Man, West Virginia, which is approximately five miles to the northwest of the Elk Creek Complex. The Elk Creek Complex is within the Southern West Virginia coal field\nof the Central Appalachia Coal Producing Region (the \"CAPP Region”) of the United States.\nCompanies that previously mined on the Elk Creek Complex include Island Creek Coal Company (\"Island Creek”) which started mining in the area in December 1904.\nConsolidation Coal Company, now known as Consol Energy, Inc. (\"Consol”), bought Island Creek in July 1993 and continued operations in and around the area until the late-1990s\nwhen Consol idled its Elk Creek Mine. Ramaco Coal bought the property from Consol in 2012 and started production on the Elk Creek Complex in the fourth quarter of 2016. The 2012\npurchase included acquisition of rail access, permitted impoundment and coal refuse disposal facilities, as well as numerous reclaimed, but permitted deep mines. Pittston Coal\nCompany operated mines on the northern Huff Creek portion (McDonald and Baisden properties) of the Elk Creek Complex in the 1970s and 1980s before the company exited the coal\nmining business in 2001.\nThe Elk Creek Complex consists of approximately 20,200 acres of leased coal holdings. Within the Elk Creek Complex controlled coal holdings, 16,000 acres lie in Logan\nCounty, 2,800 acres in Wyoming County and 1,400 acres in Mingo County. The Elk Creek Complex is in the production stage and currently has six active mines, three planned and\npermitted mines, one permitted inactive mine, and one planned but not permitted mine. The five planned and/or permitted mines include two contour surface mine developing areas for\na highwall miner, and three underground room and pillar mines, which use continuous miners for mine development. Ramaco began production of metallurgical coal at the complex in\n2016. A majority of the underground mines implement retreat mining, which results in mining recovery of greater than 80 percent. Contour mining has an average mining recovery of\napproximately 90 percent, and the highwall mines have an average mining recovery of approximately 40 percent.\nThe Elk Creek Complex is mining several seams and seam splits, including the Chilton A, Upper Dorothy, Upper Dorothy 2, 3, and 4, Middle Dorothy, Lower Dorothy, Upper\nCedar Grove, Lower Cedar Grove A, Lower Cedar Grove B, Lower Cedar Grove C, Upper Alma, Lower Alma, Powellton, Eagle, and No. 2 Gas seams, in descending stratigraphic order.\nCurrently, there are six active mines within the complex:\n● Ram No. 1 Surface and Highwall Mine;\n● Stonecoal No. 2 Alma Deep Mine;\n● Rockhouse Eagle Deep Mine;\n● No. 2 Gas Deep Mine;\n● Michael Powellton Deep Mine; and\n● Crucible Deep Mine Lower Cedar Grove B and C seams\nThere are three planned and permitted mines within the complex:\n● Ram No. 3 Surface and Highwall Mine, scheduled for 2024 startup\n● Ram No. 2 Surface and Highwall Mine (which is the extension of Ram No. 1 above), scheduled for late 2024 startup; and\n● Glen Alum Tunnel #1 Deep Mine, scheduled for 2027 startup.\nThere are two permitted inactive mines, the Eight-Kay Deep Mine that is projected to start in 2027 as well as the Monarch Deep Mine that is scheduled to start in 2026. The\nBens Creek Deep Mine is planned but is not yet permitted. The projected startup date for this mine is 2028. It is likely future mines will be planned and scheduled, as necessary, from\nresource areas within the complex, to meet internal Ramaco production goals aligned with market conditions. With the exception of the Ram No. 3 mine, all planned mines are subject\nto future Board approval.\nThe current Elk Creek Complex Life-of-Mine (\"LOM”) Plan projects mining through 2040; an expected mine life for the complex of 17 years.\n62\nTable of Contents\nAll Run-of-Mine (\"ROM”) coal is washed at the Elk Creek Preparation Plant. The Elk Creek Preparation Plant, built in 2017 by Raw Resources Group located in Princeton,\nWest Virginia, is a well designed and constructed preparation plant, with ROM processing capacity of 700 tons per hour. During 2022, we began work on a throughput upgrade at our\nElk Creek Preparation plant. We completed the expansion in 2023, which raised the nameplate processing capacity to 1,050 raw tons per hour and our annual processing capacity from\nthis complex to approximately three million tons per year.\nWe also began development work on additional low-cost, high-volatile underground and surface mines at Elk Creek. These mines began production during the second\nquarter of 2022 and reached full levels of productivity during 2023. Production increased at Elk Creek during 2023 commensurate with the increase in processing capacity discussed\nabove.\nThe gross book value of the Elk Creek Complex property and its associated plant and equipment was $269 million as of December 31, 2023. The Elk Creek Complex utilizes\nindustry standard, modern surface and underground mining equipment, processing equipment and infrastructure that is in good operating condition and capable of meeting planned\nproduction requirements using prudent operating methods and operating schedules.\nThe Elk Creek Complex produces high-quality, high-volatile metallurgical coal. Historically, the market for metallurgical coal from the Elk Creek Complex has been domestic\nmetallurgical coal consumers and the global seaborne metallurgical coal market. Coal produced from the complex is primarily high-volatile A and high-volatile B metallurgical coal. The\nElk Creek Complex also produces thermal coal and specialty coals, which represent approximately five percent of sales.\nVolatiles refers to the volatile matter contained in the coal. Classification of coal as low, mid or high-volatile refers to the specific volatile content within the coal, with coals\nof 17% to 22% volatile matter being classified as low-volatile, 23% to 31% as mid-volatile and 32% or greater as high-volatile. The volatile matter in coal impacts coke yield (i.e. the\namount of coke and coke by-products produced per ton of coal charged). Low-volatile coal contains more carbon, but too much carbon can result in coke oven damage. Too much\nvolatile matter results in less carbon and reduces the volume of coke produced. Therefore, coke producers use blends of high-volatile and low-volatile coals for coke production.\nWe are unaware of any significant encumbrances to the Elk Creek Complex, including current and future permitting requirements and associated timelines, permit conditions,\nand violations and fines.\nBerwind Complex\nThe Berwind Complex is located approximately 80 miles south of Charleston, West Virginia; 100 miles west of Roanoke, Virginia; 60 miles northeast of Kingsport, Tennessee;\nand 160 miles east/southeast of Lexington, Kentucky at N 37.164522, W 81.744893. The complex includes areas in Buchanan and Tazewell Counties, Virginia and McDowell County,\nWest Virginia. The Berwind Complex is within the Southwestern Virginia and Southern West Virginia coal fields of the CAPP Region of the United States.\nThe Berwind Complex and surrounding area have an extensive history of coal mining, primarily by underground mining methods. Mining within the Berwind/Knox Creek\nComplex likely began in the early-1900s and there have been many different mine operators both large and small in the region since then.\nThe Berwind Property consists of approximately 62,500 acres of leased coal holdings located in McDowell County, West Virginia and Buchanan and Tazewell Counties,\nVirginia. Ramaco obtained its initial lease for this property in 2015 and commenced mine operations in 2017. The Berwind Complex is in the production stage and currently has three\nactive mines. The three mines that were active at December 31, 2023 are underground room and pillar mines, which use continuous miners for mine development.\nRamaco started operations at the Berwind Pocahontas 4 Deep Mine in 2017 and idled the mine in mid-July 2022 due to an ignition that an investigation by the Mine Safety\nand Health Administration (MSHA) suggests was\n63\nTable of Contents\ncaused by lightning that struck a pilot hole for a new shaft. Production at the Berwind No. 1 Deep Mine restarted in the first quarter of 2023.\nA majority of the underground mines implement retreat mining, which typically results in mining recovery of greater than 80 percent. Contour mining has an average mining\nrecovery of approximately 90 percent, and the highwall mine has an average mining recovery of approximately 40 percent.\nThe Berwind Complex is mining several seams and seam splits, including the Pocahontas 6, Pocahontas 5, Pocahontas 4 and Pocahontas 3 seams, in descending\nstratigraphic order.\nActive Mines:\n● Laurel Fork Pocahontas 3 Deep Mine\n● Triad No. 2 Deep Mine\n● Berwind No. 1 Pocahontas 4 Deep Mine\nPermitted Mines:\n● Squire Jim No. 1 Deep Mine, permitted but not planned for startup\nThe current Berwind Complex Life-of-Mine (LOM) Plan projects mining through 2049, an expected mine life for the complex of 20+ years. However, it is likely future mines will\nbe planned and scheduled, as necessary, from resource areas within the complex, to meet internal Ramaco production goals aligned with market conditions.\nAll Run-of-Mine (ROM) coal is washed at the Berwind Preparation Plant with no planned direct shipment coal. The Berwind Preparation Plant was initially built in 1955 and\ncommissioned in 1957. Ramaco refurbished the preparation plant in 2021 and 2022 based on a design by Ramsey Industrial, with a current ROM processing capacity of 600 tons per\nhour.\nThe gross book value of the Berwind Complex property and its associated plant and equipment was $155 million as of December 31, 2023. The Berwind Complex utilizes\nindustry standard, modern surface and underground mining equipment, processing equipment and infrastructure that is in good operating condition and capable of meeting planned\nproduction requirements using prudent operating methods and operating schedules.\nThe Berwind Complex produces high-quality, mid and low-volatile metallurgical coal. Historically, the market for metallurgical coal from the Berwind Complex has been for\nboth domestic metallurgical coal consumers and the global seaborne metallurgical coal market.\nWe are unaware of any significant encumbrances to the Berwind Complex, including current and future permitting requirements and associated timelines, permit conditions,\nand violations and fines.\nKnox Creek Complex\nThe Knox Creek Complex consists of two general properties or areas as follows:\n● Big Creek Property; and\n● Knox Creek Property\nThe Knox Creek Complex is located approximately 80 miles south of Charleston, West Virginia; 100 miles west of Roanoke, Virginia; 60 miles northeast of Kingsport,\nTennessee; and 160 miles east/southeast of Lexington, Kentucky at N 37.164522, W 81.744893. The complex includes areas in Buchanan, Russell and Tazewell Counties, Virginia and\nMcDowell County, West Virginia. The Knox Creek Complex is within the Southwestern Virginia and Southern West Virginia coal fields of the CAPP Region of the United States.\nThe Knox Creek Complex and surrounding area have an extensive history of coal mining, primarily by underground mining methods. Mining within the Knox Creek Complex\nlikely began in the early-1900s and there have been many different mine operators both large and small in the region since then.\n64\nTable of Contents\nThe Knox Creek Complex consists of approximately 64,050 acres of owned and leased coal holdings. Within the Knox Creek Complex controlled coal holdings, 5,370 acres lie\nin McDowell County, West Virginia. The Knox Creek Complex is in the production stage and currently has two active mines and two planned and permitted mines. There are no active\nor planned West Virginia mines currently within the Knox Creek Complex. The two active mines include one contour surface mine developing areas for a highwall miner, and one\nunderground room and pillar mine, which uses continuous miners for mine development.\nRamaco began production of metallurgical coal at the complex in 2019. The underground mines will implement retreat mining, which typically results in mining recovery of 50\nto 80 percent. At the surface mine, contour mining has an average mining recovery of approximately 90 percent, and highwall mining has an average mining recovery of approximately\n40 percent.\nThe Knox Creek Complex is mining or plans to mine several seams and seam splits, including the Jawbone, Kennedy and Tiller seams.\nActive Mines:\n● Big Creek Jawbone No. 1 Deep Mine\n● Big Creek Surface and Highwall Mine\nPlanned and Permitted Mines:\n● Knox Creek Tiller Deep Mine, scheduled for 2026 startup\n● Kennedy No. 3 Deep Mine, scheduled for 2026 startup\nThe current Knox Creek Complex Life-of-Mine (LOM) Plan projects mining through 2037, an expected mine life for the complex of 15 years. It is anticipated that future mines\nwill be planned and scheduled, as necessary, from resource areas within the complex, to meet internal Ramaco production goals aligned with market conditions. Both planned mines\nlisted above are subject to future Board approval.\nAll Run-of-Mine (ROM) coal is washed at the Knox Creek Preparation Plant. The Knox Creek Preparation Plant, built in 1981 by Powell Construction Company located in\nJohnson City, Tennessee, is a well designed and constructed preparation plant, with ROM processing capacity of 750 tons per hour.\nThe gross book value of the Knox Creek Complex property and its associated plant and equipment was $47 million as of December 31, 2023. The Knox Creek Complex utilizes\nindustry standard, modern surface and underground mining equipment, processing equipment and infrastructure that is in good operating condition and capable of meeting planned\nproduction requirements using prudent operating methods and operating schedules.\nThe Knox Creek Complex produces high-quality, mid and high-volatile metallurgical coal. Historically, the market for metallurgical coal from the Knox Creek Complex has\nincluded both domestic metallurgical coal consumers and the global seaborne metallurgical coal market. The Knox Creek Complex also sporadically produces a minimal quantity of\nthermal coal from the surface mine from oxidized zones.\nWe are unaware of any significant encumbrances to the Knox Creek Complex, including current and future permitting requirements and associated timelines, permit\nconditions, and violations and fines.\nOther Properties\nRefer to the discussion of our Maben Complex and our RAM Mine under Item 1. \"Business - Our Projects” for information about these properties, which are not included in\nthe disclosures of mineral resources and reserves at December 31, 2023 to follow.

Our coal resource and reserve estimates are based on data obtained from our drilling activities and other available geologic data.\nAcquisitions or sales of coal properties will change these estimates. Changes in mining methods or the utilization of new technologies may increase or decrease the recovery basis for\na coal seam. The most recent studies of our coal reserves for the Elk Creek Complex, Berwind Complex, and Knox Creek Complex were prepared by an independent engineering firm,\nWeir International, Inc. (\"Weir”). In periods between third party updates, we update reserves utilizing our internal staff of engineers and geologists based on production data. We\nintend to continue to periodically retain outside experts to assist management with the verification of our estimates of our coal reserves going forward.\nWeir prepared our reserve reporting in compliance with the Regulation S-K 1300 requirements. Weir initiated this process with us by completing a historical project review as\nwell as its validation of our complete drill hole database. Weir validated that property control is accurately reflected in reserve modeling, verifying the latest property boundaries,\nincluding control by each seam. Weir also examined reserve boundaries to ensure agreement with mining parameters, such as minimum thickness, minimum yield and minimum inter-\nburden between seams. Resource classification is determined based on the expectation of our meeting these mining parameters. Weir also conducted mining integrity checks to\nensure each reserve area is minable.\n67\nTable of Contents\nIn determining whether our reserves meet this standard, we take into account, among other things, our potential ability to obtain a mining permit, the possible necessity of\nrevising a mining plan, changes in estimated future costs, changes in future cash flows caused by changes in costs required to be incurred to meet regulatory requirements and\nobtaining or renewing mining permits, variations in quantity and quality of coal, and varying levels of demand and their effects on selling prices. Further, the economic recoverability\nof our reserves is based on market conditions including contracted pricing, market pricing and overall demand for our coal. Thus, the actual value at which we no longer consider our\nreserves to be economically recoverable varies depending on the length of time in which the specific market conditions are expected to last. We consider our reserves to be\neconomically recoverable at a price in excess of our cash costs to mine the coal and fund our ongoing replacement capital. The reserves in this Annual Report are classified by\nreliability or accuracy in decreasing order of geological assurance as Proven (Measured) and Probable (Indicated).\nSummaries of the mineral resources and mineral reserves as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are shown below. Weir served as the QP and prepared the estimates\nof mineral resources and mineral reserves at the Berwind Complex, Knox Creek Complex, and Elk Creek Complex. Since a material change has not occurred from the last TRS filed for\neach complex, the previous years’ TRSs have not been updated. Refer to Exhibit 96.1, 96.2, and 96.3 for access to the previous TRS for the Berwind Complex, Knox Creek Complex, and\nElk Creek Complex, respectively.\nYear ended December 31, Year ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nMeasured + Proven + Measured + Proven +\nIndicated In- Probable Clean Indicated In- Probable Clean\nPlace Recoverable Place Recoverable\n(in millions) Resources Reserves Resources Reserves\nArea\nBerwind Complex 629 23 629 24\nKnox Creek Complex 275 8 301 8\nElk Creek Complex 215 28 215 30\nRAM Mine — — 11 —\nTotal 1,119 59 1,156 62\nEstimates of coal reserves and resources are updated annually to reflect changes resulting from active mine production, mine plan modifications, property acquisitions/sales,\nimpacts of additional exploration drilling, and any other changes that impact remaining coal reserve and resource tonnage.\nThe combined proven and probable reserves at the Berwind, Knox Creek and Elk Creek complexes decreased by three million tons due to 2023 production. Measured and\nindicated coal resources decreased by 37 million tons during 2023, approximately 25 million tons were due to property control changes (assignment of coal leases) at the Knox Creek\nComplex and 11 million tons were due to the permit denial at the RAM mine and our decision not to pursue an appeal.\nKey assumptions and parameters relating to the mineral resources and mineral reserves are discussed in sections 11 and 12, respectively, of each TRS.\nExploration Target\nBrook Mine is an exploration property that includes three drillhole programs involving a total of 123 new core drillholes. Specifically, targeting REEs has been completed\nwithin the current Brook Mine permit area. So far, the results of these drilling programs indicate elevated levels of REEs, along with significant concentrations of other critical\nelements such as Yttrium, Gallium, and Germanium. Work is ongoing to evaluate the potential exploitation of these minerals within the current Brook Mine permit area.\nThere has been insufficient exploration of the Brook Mine to estimate a mineral resource and it is unclear, at present, whether further exploration will result in the estimation\nof a mineral resource. The exploration target therefore does not represent, and should not be construed to be, an estimate of a mineral resource or mineral reserve as such terms are\nused in subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K.\n68\nTable of Contents\nInternal Controls\nIn our exploration and mineral resource and reserve estimation efforts, we utilize a certified American National Standards Institute third-party laboratory, which has in-house\nquality control and assurance procedures. Once in possession of the samples, the laboratory standard sample preparation and security procedures are followed. After the sample has\nbeen tested, reviewed, and accepted, the disposal of the sample is done in accordance with local, state and EPA approved methods.\nWeir has determined the sample preparation, security and analysis procedures used for our drillhole samples meet current coal industry standards and practices for quality\ntesting, with laboratory results suitable to use for geological modeling, mineral resource estimation and economic evaluation.\nYear-end reserve estimates are and will continue to be reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer and other senior management, and revisions are communicated to our board of\ndirectors. Inaccuracies in our estimates of our coal reserves could result in decreased profitability from lower-than-expected revenue or higher-than-expected costs. Actual production\nrecovered from identified reserve areas and properties, and revenue and expenditures associated with our mining operations, may vary materially from estimates.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nDue to the nature of our business, we may become, from time to time, involved in routine litigation or subject to disputes or claims related to our business activities. In the\nopinion of our management, there are no pending litigation, disputes or claims against us which, if decided adversely, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,\ncash flows or results of operations. For a description of our legal proceedings, see \"Commitments and Contingencies,” Note 10 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nThe information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K is included\nin Exhibit 95.1 to this Annual Report.\n69\nTable of Contents\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity and Related Shareholder Matters\nOn June 12, 2023, an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation was approved by shareholder vote to reclassify the Company’s existing common\nstock as shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and create a separate Class B common stock having a par value of $0.01 per share.\nThe initial distribution of Class B common stock occurred on June 21, 2023 via a stock dividend to existing holders of common stock as of May 12, 2023. On the date of initial\ndistribution, each holder of common stock received 0.2 shares of Class B common stock for every one share of existing common stock held on the record date.\nMarket Information. Our Class A and Class B common stock are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbols \"METC” and \"METCB,” respectively, and\nour Notes are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \"METCL.”\nHolders. As of the close of business on February 29, 2024, there were 87 holders of record of our Class A common stock and 76 holders of record of our Class B common\nstock. Because many of our common shares are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders\nrepresented by these holders of record.\nDividends. In addition to the stock dividend discussed above, the Company declared $27.5 million of total cash dividends during 2023, which includes $5.6 million under the\nCompany’s single class structure, $17.0 million to Class A shareholders, and $3.6 million to Class B shareholders as well as $1.2 million of forfeitable dividends subject to the\nvesting conditions of outstanding restricted stock units and performance stock units.\nFor holders of Class A common stock, including common stock reclassified to Class A common stock, cash dividends were declared quarterly in the amount of $0.125 per\nshare with the exception of the final quarterly dividend, which was declared in the amount of $0.1375 per share. The Company anticipates declaring cash dividends on a quarterly\nbasis at the newly approved amount; however, future declarations of dividends are subject to Board of Directors’ approval and may be adjusted as business needs or market\nconditions change.\nFor holders of Class B common stock, cash dividends were declared in the amount of $0.165 per share and $0.249 per share in the third and fourth quarter, respectively. In\naddition, the Company declared another quarterly cash dividend in February 2024, subsequent to the date of the financial statements, in the amount of $0.242 per share of Class B\ncommon stock. All cash dividends declared to date for Class B common stock were based on 20% of CORE royalty and infrastructure fees for the previous quarter. The Company\nanticipates continuing to declare quarterly cash dividends based on 20% of CORE royalty and infrastructure fees; however, future declarations of dividends are subject to the sole\ndiscretion of the Company’s Board of Directors. In addition, the Board of Directors retains the power to change or add expense allocation policies related to CORE, redefine CORE\nassets, and redetermine CORE’s per-ton usage fees at any time without shareholder approval.\nIn regard to stock dividends, such as the initial non-cash distribution of Class B common stock discussed above, there are currently no plans to declare additional dividends\npayable in stock.\nEquity Compensation Plans. The Company does not have any non-stockholder approved equity compensation plans. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 9 for the Company’s\nequity compensation plan information.\nStock repurchases. The Company routinely allows employees to surrender common stock that would be issuable upon the vesting or exercise of stock-based compensation\nawards to pay estimated taxes. The value of common stock surrendered by employees is determined based on the price of the Company’s common stock at the time of relinquishment.\nThere were no repurchases of common shares during the quarter or year ended December 31, 2023.\n70\nTable of Contents\nItem 6. [Reserved]\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition and contains forward-looking\nstatements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. The forward-looking statements are dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties that may\nbe outside our control. We caution you that our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or\ncontribute to such differences are discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in the \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and \"Risk Factors,”\nall of which are difficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. We do not undertake any\nobligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law.\nOverview\nOur primary source of revenue is the sale of metallurgical coal. We are a pure-play metallurgical coal company with 59 million reserve tons and 1,119 million measured and\nindicated resource tons of high-quality metallurgical coal. Our plan is to continue development of our existing properties and grow annual production over the next few years to\napproximately seven million clean tons of metallurgical coal, subject to market conditions, permitting and additional capital deployment in the medium-term. We may make acquisitions\nof reserves or infrastructure that continue our focus on advantaged geology and lower costs.\nThe overall outlook of the metallurgical coal business is dependent on a variety of factors such as pricing, regulatory uncertainties and global economic conditions. Coal\nconsumption and production in the U.S. is driven by several market dynamics and trends including the U.S. and global economies, the U.S. dollar’s strength relative to other\ncurrencies and accelerating production cuts. In addition, blast furnace steelmaking is more prevalent outside the U.S. compared to domestic steel production, which creates demand\nfor exports of metallurgical coal.\nAlthough conflicts overseas continue and economic growth remains uncertain in some regions of the world, supply constraints continue to support the global metallurgical\ncoal market overall. Ongoing bans on the import of Russian coal have affected the availability of supply to certain seaborne markets as well as contributed to volatility in prices.\nMetallurgical coal benchmark prices increased significantly in early 2022, but then fell throughout the rest of the year. Market pricing for 2023 was generally down from 2022\nlevels but remains favorable versus long-term averages. We expect metallurgical coal prices to remain volatile in the near term. In addition, we anticipate that inflation may remain high\nin the near term for steel prices, freight rates, labor, and materials, which would continue to negatively affect our profitability.\nDuring 2023, we sold 3.5 million tons of coal. North American markets made up 33% of our 2023 revenues and export markets, excluding Canada, accounted for 67% of our\n2023 revenues. The Company is responsible for rail and loadout costs for coal sold into export markets. During 2022, we sold 2.5 million tons of coal. North American markets made up\n58% of our 2022 revenues and export markets, excluding Canada, accounted for 42% of our 2022 revenues. We purchase coal from third parties for sale for our own account from time\nto time; however, sales of Company-produced coal made up 95% and 98% of total sales in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe annual contracting season with North American steel producers generally occurs in late-summer through the fall. As of December 31, 2023, we had entered into forward\nsales contracts with certain North American customers on a fixed price basis for 1.4 million tons of coal at an average realizable price of $166 per ton, excluding freight. This level of\npricing in 2023 is lower than the average price of $198 per ton that was obtained during the previous contracting season for North America. This is due to a combination of factors,\nincluding changes in demand, variations in the types of coal qualities being purchased, fluctuations in steel prices, and other macroeconomic trends. The Company shifted to\n71\nTable of Contents\nmore export sales in the Company’s mix of revenues during 2023, which will likely continue into 2024. Export sales often contain index-based pricing and, therefore, greater volatility in\npricing and revenues.\nIn 2023, our capital expenditures were $82.9 million, excluding capitalized interest of $1.1 million. In 2022, our capital expenditures were $123.0 million, excluding cash paid for\nthe acquisitions of Ramaco Coal and Maben Coal assets which totaled $23.6 million as well as capitalized interest of $1.1 million. The decrease in capital expenditures was due to the\nCompany’s progress related to strategic growth projects at our Elk Creek and Berwind mining complexes. We completed the expansion of processing capacity at the Elk Creek\npreparation plant in 2023, which now has an annualized processing and shipping capacity of approximately three million tons per year.\nOn July 10, 2022, we experienced a methane ignition at the Berwind No. 1 mine, which was one of the active mines at our Berwind mining complex. There were no personnel in\nthe mine at the time of the incident and no injuries or fatalities occurred. The overall impact to pre-tax earnings in 2022 was immaterial except for idle mine costs of $9.5 million\nrecognized during the year. The Company subsequently recognized other income of $8.1 million in 2023 related to insurance proceeds received for the event. Production from the\nBerwind No. 1 mine restarted in the first quarter of 2023.\nAs a result of the increase in capacity at the Elk Creek plant, the re-opening of the Berwind No. 1 mine described above, and the start of production at the Maben mine during\n2023, the Company was producing just under an annualized four million tons per year run rate at the later part of 2023. The Company expects to produce between 4.0 million and 4.4\nmillion tons in 2024 depending on market conditions.\nOn June 21, 2023, the Company distributed Class B common stock, a tracking stock, to provide existing holders of the Company’s common stock an opportunity to\nparticipate directly in the financial performance of the Company’s CORE assets on a stand-alone basis, separate from the Company’s metallurgical coal operations. CORE assets were\nacquired initially by the Company as part of the Company’s acquisition of Ramaco Coal in the second quarter of 2022. The financial performance of CORE assets consists of the\nfollowing non-cost-bearing revenue streams based on the Company’s current expectations:\n● Royalty fees derived from the royalties associated with the Ramaco Coal and Amonate reserves, which we believe approximates 3% of Company-produced coal sales\nrevenue excluding coal sales revenue from Knox Creek,\n● Infrastructure fees based on $5.00 per ton of coal processed at our preparation plants and $2.50 per ton of loaded coal at the Company’s rail load-out facilities, and\n● Future income derived, if and when realized, from advanced carbon products and rare earth elements initiatives.\nThe Company anticipates paying a quarterly cash dividend equal to 20% of the total fees above; however, any dividend amounts declared and paid are subject to the sole\ndiscretion of the Company’s Board of Directors. Dividends paid on the tracking stock allow the Company to return to Class B common stockholders a portion of the savings from\nroyalties and infrastructure usage fees resulting from the acquisition of Ramaco Coal. In addition, the tracking stock provides an opportunity for Class B common stockholders to\nparticipate directly in the potential revenue growth associated with the development of carbon products and rare earth elements. The Company paid cash dividends on Class B\ncommon stock during the third and fourth quarter of 2023.\nSeparate financial statements for CORE have not been included as exhibits to this filing since CORE’s financial performance and dividends will be evaluated based on non-\ncost-bearing revenue streams, at least initially, and other potential forms of passive income rather than reduced by allocated costs and expenses.\nThe Company continues to assess its potential REEs deposit in Wyoming. To date, the results of drilling programs indicate elevated levels of REEs, along with significant\nconcentrations of other critical elements such as Yttrium, Gallium, and Germanium. The exploration target does not represent, and should not be construed to be, a mineral resource or\nmineral reserve as such terms are used in subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. The Company also continues its work to advance new carbon product technologies with the goal of\ncommercializing products that use coal in both an improved economic and environmental manner.\n72\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nYears ended December 31,\n(In thousands, except per share amounts) 2023 2022 2021\nRevenue $ 693,524 $ 565,688 $ 283,394\nCosts and expenses\nCost of sales (exclusive of items shown separately below) 493,793 332,960 195,412\nAsset retirement obligations accretion 1,403 1,115 615\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization 54,252 41,194 26,205\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 48,831 40,032 21,629\nTotal costs and expenses 598,279 415,301 243,861\nOperating income 95,245 150,387 39,533\nOther income (expense), net 18,321 2,637 7,429\nInterest expense, net (8,903) (6,829) (2,556)\nIncome before tax 104,663 146,195 44,406\nIncome tax expense 22,350 30,153 4,647\nNet income $ 82,313 $ 116,042 $ 39,759\nEarnings per common share\nBasic - Single class (through 6/20/2023) $ 0.71 $ 2.63 $ 0.90\nBasic - Class A (6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023) $ 1.06 $ — $ —\nTotal $ 1.77 $ 2.63 $ 0.90\nBasic - Class B (6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023) $ 0.42 $ — $ —\nDiluted - Single class (through 6/20/23) $ 0.70 $ 2.60 $ 0.90\nDiluted - Class A (6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023) $ 1.03 $ — $ —\nTotal $ 1.73 $ 2.60 $ 0.90\nDiluted - Class B (6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023) $ 0.40 $ — $ —\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 182,126 $ 204,555 $ 79,042\nNet income and Adjusted EBITDA were lower in 2023 compared to 2022, despite the increase in sales volume, due to lower sales pricing and higher cost per ton sold in 2023.\nNet income and Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 benefitted from $15.9 million of pre-tax income for proceeds received from insurance claims related to the 2022 Berwind ignition event and\n2018 silo failure.

The increase in sales volume was due to greater export sales and\nwas aided by the Company’s increased capacity for production achieved during 2023. Revenue per ton sold decreased 13% from $231 per ton in 2022 to $201 per ton in 2023. Revenue\nper ton sold (FOB mine), a non-GAAP measure which excludes transportation revenues and demurrage, decreased 18% from $207 per ton in 2022 to $170 per ton in 2023 including\ncompany-produced coal and purchased coal. The decrease in both revenue per ton sold measures in 2023 was driven by the variability in index-based pricing for export sales.\nRefer to Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Concentrations and Note 11—Revenues in Item 8, Part II for additional information regarding sales to\ncustomers.\nCost of sales. Our cost of sales increased 48% from 2022, which was driven by the increase in tons sold discussed above. Cost of sales per ton sold increased 5% from $136\nper ton in 2022 to $143 per ton in 2023. Cash cost per ton sold (FOB mine), a non-GAAP measure which excludes transportation costs and idle mine costs, increased 3% from $108 per\nton in 2022 to $111 per ton in 2023, including company-produced coal and purchased coal. The increase in both cost per ton sold measures in 2023 was primarily due to inflationary\npressures on labor and supplies.\n74\nTable of Contents\nAsset retirement obligation accretion. ARO accretion was $1.4 million for 2023 and $1.1 million for 2022. The higher level of accretion in 2023 was driven primarily by\nchanges in estimates of future cash flows.\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense totaled $54.3 million in 2023 compared to $41.2 million in 2022. The increase in\n2023 occurred across all asset classes consistent with the Company’s initiative to grow production.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $48.8 million for 2023 compared to $40.0 million for 2022. The 22% increase\nin 2023 was primarily due to greater compensation-related expenses and headcount as well as increased spending for professional services consistent with the Company’s growth\nefforts.\nOther income (expense), net. Other income, net was $18.3 million in 2023 compared to $2.6 million in 2022. The activity in 2023 was related mostly to insurance proceeds\nreceived in 2023 related to the 2022 Berwind ignition event that occurred in 2022 and the silo failure that occurred in 2018. The Company received proceeds of $17.0 million during 2023\nand had accrued a recovery asset of $1.1 million in the previous period; thus, a gain of $15.9 million was recognized in 2023. This activity is not indicative of expected future results.\nThe activity in 2022 was driven by the gain of $2.1 million recognized on the sale of mineral rights.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net was approximately $8.9 million in 2023 as compared to $6.8 million in 2022. The increase in net interest expense in 2023 was\nprimarily due to increased use of the revolving credit facility during 2023.\nIncome tax expense. We recognized income tax expense of $22.4 million and $30.2 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The lower amount in 2023 was largely due to the\ndecrease in income before taxes. Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part I in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for an explanation of\ndifferences versus the statutory rate of 21%.\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021\nPlease see Part I, Item 7, \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a\ndiscussion of the results of operation for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure by management and external users of our financial statements, such as\nindustry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus net interest expense; stock-based compensation; depreciation, depletion, and amortization expenses; income taxes; certain\nnon-operating expenses (charitable contributions); and accretion of asset retirement obligations. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA is included below.\n75\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted EBITDA is not intended to serve as a substitute to U.S. GAAP measures of performance and may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other\ncompanies.\nYears ended December 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA\nNet income $ 82,313 $ 116,042 $ 39,759\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization 54,252 41,194 26,205\nInterest expense, net 8,903 6,829 2,556\nIncome tax expense 22,350 30,153 4,647\nEBITDA 167,818 194,218 73,167\nStock-based compensation 12,905 8,222 5,260\nOther non-operating expenses — 1,000 —\nAccretion of asset retirement obligation 1,403 1,115 615\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 182,126 $ 204,555 $ 79,042\nNon-GAAP revenue per ton sold. Non-GAAP revenue per ton sold (FOB mine) is calculated as coal sales revenue less transportation revenues and demurrage, divided by\ntons sold. We believe revenue per ton (FOB mine) provides useful information to investors as it enables investors to compare revenue per ton we generate against similar measures\nmade by other publicly-traded coal companies and more effectively monitor changes in coal prices from period to period excluding the impact of transportation costs which are\nbeyond our control. The adjustments made to arrive at these measures are significant in understanding and assessing our financial performance. Revenue per ton sold (FOB mine) is\nnot a measure of financial performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP and, therefore, should not be considered as a substitute to revenue under U.S. GAAP.\nYear ended December 31, 2023 Year ended December 31, 2022\nCompany Purchased Company Purchased\n(In thousands, except per ton amounts) Produced Coal Total Produced Coal Total\nRevenue $ 657,090 $ 36,434 $ 693,524 $ 553,830 $ 11,858 $ 565,688\nLess: Adjustments to reconcile to Non-GAAP revenue (FOB mine)\nTransportation (100,174) (4,723) (104,897) (57,299) (813) (58,112)\nNon-GAAP revenue (FOB mine) $ 556,916 $ 31,711 $ 588,627 $ 496,531 $ 11,045 $ 507,576\nTons sold 3,299 156 3,455 2,396 54 2,450\nNon-GAAP revenue per ton sold (FOB mine) $ 169 $ 203 $ 170 $ 207 $ 203 $ 207\nRefer to coal sales information for revenue per ton sold (GAAP) calculations\nNon-GAAP cash cost per ton sold.

The Company expects to satisfy approximately 88%\nof these commitments in 2024 and the remainder in 2025. Sales commitments of another 0.4 million tons were obtained subsequent to December 31, 2023 for delivery in 2024. We expect\nthe shift to more export sales in the Company’s mix of revenue that occurred in 2023 to continue during 2024, which may lead to volatility in revenues due to index-based pricing.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary source of cash is proceeds from the sale of our coal production to customers. Our primary uses of cash include the cash costs of coal production, capital\nexpenditures, acquisitions, royalty payments, and other operating expenditures.\nCash flow information is as follows:\nYears ended December 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nConsolidated statement of cash flow data:\nCash flows provided by operating activities $ 161,036 $ 187,870 $ 53,340\nCash flows used for investing activities (72,211) (145,708) (59,613)\nCash flows (used for) provided by financing activities (82,517) (28,495) 22,369\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 6,308 $ 13,667 $ 16,096\nCash flows provided by operating activities during 2023 decreased $26.8 million versus the prior year driven by lower cash earnings. Changes in operating assets and\nliabilities were favorable versus the prior year due to a variety of factors, most notably, variations in income tax payments as the Company received an $11.8 million refund in 2023.\nNet cash used for investing activities during 2023 decreased $73.5 million versus the prior year primarily due to lower capital expenditures and acquisition-related activity of\n$40.1 million and $22.2 million, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures was due to the Company’s progress related to strategic growth projects at our Elk Creek and Berwind\nmining complexes. The strategic acquisitions Maben Coal and Ramaco Coal, as well as the concurrent sale of mineral rights, took place in 2022 and no such transactions occurred in\n2023. In addition, the Company received $11.2 million of insurance proceeds during 2023 related to property, plant, and equipment claims from the 2022 Berwind ignition event and\n2018 silo failure.\n77\nTable of Contents\nNet cash used for financing activities was $54.0 million higher in 2023 versus 2022, which was driven by greater repayment of debts and similar financings including $25.0\nmillion and $9.6 million related to the Ramaco Coal and Maben Coal asset acquisitions, respectively. In addition, the Company also paid $5.8 million more cash dividends during 2023,\nwhich was largely due to $3.6 million of cash dividends paid on Class B common stock that was initially distributed in 2023, as part of the Company’s strategy to increase value for its\nshareholders. The Company declared an additional quarterly cash dividend for holders of Class B common stock in February 2024, subsequent to the date of the financial statements,\nin the amount of $0.242 per share of Class B common stock.\nAll cash dividends declared to date for Class B common stock were based on 20% of CORE royalty and infrastructure fees for the previous quarter as shown below.\nThree months ended Three months ended Three months ended\nDecember 31, September 30, June 30,\n(In thousands) 2023 2023 2023\nRoyalties\nRamaco Coal $ 3,276 $ 3,572 $ 1,351\nAmonate Assets 722 614 752\nOther 14 13 —\nTotal Royalties $ 4,012 $ 4,199 $ 2,103\nInfrastructure Fees\nPreparation Plants (Processing at $5.00/ton) $ 4,432 $ 4,521 $ 3,433\nRail Load-outs (Loading at $2.50/ton) 2,198 2,202 1,726\nTotal Infrastructure Fees (at $7.50/ton) $ 6,630 $ 6,723 $ 5,159\nCORE Royalty and Infrastructure Fees $ 10,642 $ 10,922 $ 7,262\nTotal Cash Available for Dividend for Class B Common Stock $ 10,642 $ 10,922 $ 7,262\n20% of Cash Available for Dividend for Class B Common Stock $ 2,128 $ 2,184 $ 1,452\nRestricted cash balances at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $0.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively, and consisted of funds held in escrow for potential\nfuture workers’ compensation claims. Restricted cash balances were included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nPlease see Part I, Item 7, \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a\ndiscussion of the Company’s cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIndebtedness\nAt December 31, 2023, we had $91.4 million of outstanding debts, or $90.2 million net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs. Our indebtedness was comprised of $42.5\nmillion of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, $34.5 million of Senior Notes ($33.3 million net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs), $11.4 million of\nunpaid financing related to the Maben Coal assets acquisition, and $3.0 of various equipment loans. Of these amounts, $56.5 million is expected to be repaid in 2024, including $42.5\nmillion of revolver borrowings that were repaid shortly after the balance sheet date using funds from current operations and $11.4 million of acquisition financing that is contractually\ndue in 2024. The remaining amount of $34.9 million, or $33.7 net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs, is mostly comprised of the Senior Notes due in 2026.\n78\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s outstanding debt decreased approximately $37.0 million in 2023 and was due primarily to the repayment of financing associated with the previous\nacquisitions of Ramaco Coal and Maben Coal in the amount of $40.0 million and $9.6 million, respectively. The Company’s outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit\nFacility increased $17.5 million compared to 2022.\nThe acquisition of Ramaco Coal helps to reduce royalty expenses associated with the Company’s metallurgical operations in the Appalachian basin and, along with the\nacquisition of Maben Coal, complement our existing low-vol portfolio, both of which help achieve the Company’s objective of remaining among the lowest cost producers of\nmetallurgical coal in the U.S. In addition, the acquisition of Ramaco Coal includes potential concentrations of rare earth elements and is being used to support the Company’s\npossible expansion into the manufacture and commercialization of advanced carbon products and materials from coal, both of which provide additional growth opportunities in the\nfuture. The financing associated with the acquisition of Ramaco Coal, which was provided by a related party, was repaid in full during 2023.\nRevolver borrowings are typically used for the management of our normal operating cash position. Revolver borrowings that were outstanding at December 31, 2023 were\nrepaid in full during January 2024.\nIn addition to the debts discussed above, the Company finances the payment of premiums associated with various insurance policies. The Company’s liability at December\n31, 2023 was $4.0 million, which must be repaid in 2024.\nThe Company also has various finance leases for mining equipment, which generally include terms from three to five years. The Company’s total liability for finance leases at\nDecember 31, 2023 was $10.4 million, which includes $5.5 million due in 2024 and $4.9 million due thereafter.\nRefer to Notes 7 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part I in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on indebtedness\nand leases.\nLiquidity\nAs of December 31, 2023, our available liquidity was $90.6 million, comprised of $42.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and $48.6 million of availability under the\nRevolving Credit Facility for future borrowings. Total current assets were in excess of total current liabilities, which included $42.5 million of revolver borrowings repaid in January\n2024, by $19.7 million. The Company is party to an arrangement that began in 2023 whereby our cash and cash equivalents are placed at various banks in amounts no greater than the\n$250,000 FDIC-insured limit to help safeguard against potential losses in the financial sector. The Revolving Credit facility, which includes multiple lending parties and has a maturity\ndate of February 15, 2026, provides added flexibility to the Company to pursue our strategic growth initiatives and manage our normal operating cash position as well as withstand\npotential changes in macroeconomic conditions.\nThe terms of the Revolving Credit facility include covenants limiting the ability of the Company to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans, incur liens,\nconsummate mergers and similar fundamental changes, make restricted payments, and enter into transactions with affiliates. The terms of the facility also require the Company to\nmaintain certain covenants, including fixed charge ratio and compensating balance requirements. A fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.10:1.00, calculated as of the last day\nof each fiscal quarter, must be maintained by the Company. In addition, the Company must maintain an average daily cash balance of $5 million, as determined on a monthly basis, in a\ndedicated account as well as an additional $1 million in a separate dedicated account to assure future credit availability. At December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all debt\ncovenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nOur primary use of cash includes capital expenditures for mine development, infrastructure, and equipment as well as ongoing operating expenses and repayment of\nfinancing associated with previous acquisitions. As of the date of this Annual Report, we expect to fund our capital and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months and the\nreasonably foreseeable future with cash on hand, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, and projected cash\n79\nTable of Contents\nflows from operations. Factors that could adversely impact our future liquidity and ability to carry out our capital expenditure program include the following:\n● Timely delivery of our product by rail and other transportation carriers;\n● Late payments of accounts receivable by our customers;\n● Cost overruns in our purchases of equipment needed to complete our mine development plans;\n● Delays in completion of development of our various mines, processing plants and refuse disposal facilities, which would reduce the coal we would have available to sell and\nour cash flow from operations; and\n● Adverse changes in the metallurgical coal markets that would reduce the expected cash flow from operations.\nIf future cash flows were to become insufficient to meet our liquidity needs or capital requirements, due to changes in macroeconomic conditions or otherwise, we may\nreduce our expected level of capital expenditures for new mine production and/or fund a portion of our capital expenditures through the issuance of debt or equity securities, new\ndebt arrangements, or from other sources such as asset sales.\nOn September 1, 2023, the Company filed a shelf registration statement to sell any combination of Class A common stock, Class B common stock, preferred stock, depositary\nshares, debt securities, warrants, and rights at an aggregate initial offering price of up to $400.0 million, which was declared effective on September 29, 2023. However, the Company\nhas no specific plans to raise capital at this time and no securities may be sold until a prospectus supplement describing the method and terms of any future offering is delivered.\nIn March 2024, Ramaco initiated actions to extend the maturity date and increase the size of its existing Revolver facility. The Company is targeting a $200 million facility with\na $75 million accordion feature and a maturity date of five years from the closing date. The Company hopes to achieve a successful syndication of the new facility during the second\nquarter of 2024, which would strengthen our liquidity and provide additional flexibility in support of the Company’s strategic initiatives and operations.\nWorking Capital\nAccounts receivable were $96.9 million at December 31, 2023, which increased $55.7 million versus December 31, 2022 driven by the $67.5 million increase in fourth quarter\nrevenues. Inventories were $37.2 million at December 31, 2023, which decreased $7.8 million versus December 31, 2022 driven by the logistical and rail challenges we experienced in\n2022. Accounts payable were $51.6 million at December 31, 2023, up from December 31, 2022 due to increased spending.\nCapital Requirements\nDuring 2022 we spent $123.0 million for capital additions, over 75% of which related to ongoing growth projects, including the increase in capacity to accommodate higher\nproduction levels at the Elk Creek and Berwind mining complexes. During 2023 the Company spent $82.9 million on capital additions, a significantly lower amount versus 2022, as the\nCompany has made substantial progress in achieving its growth initiatives.\nWe anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $53-63 million in 2024, which will likely be weighted more toward maintenance capital than growth capital and\ndevelopment projects. The shift toward maintenance capital is due to the Company’s substantial investments in growth projects in previous periods and its progress to date\nregarding these initiatives. Despite this shift, it should be noted that the Company entered into an agreement during February 2024 to purchase preparation plant assets for the\nMaben Complex at a price of $3 million. The Company anticipates spending an additional $8 million in capital expenditures related to the plant in 2024. These assets will be relocated\nto the Maben Complex and reassembled there for future use with the purpose of reducing the cost of transporting current raw coal production. These assets will also provide the\nCompany with a preparation facility to handle additional future production from a deep mine complex at Maben should the Company decide in the future to pursue such development.\n80\nTable of Contents\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2023:\nPayments due by period\n2 – 3 4 – 5 More than 5\n(In thousands) Total 1 year years years years\nMinimum coal lease and royalty obligations $ 27,195 $ 3,358 $ 6,486 $ 6,316 $ 11,035\nDebt, excluding interest 91,383 56,534 34,849 — —\nInsurance financing 4,037 4,037 — — —\nLeases 11,940 6,075 3,953 1,912 —\nTake-or-pay obligations 20,237 5,612 9,000 5,625 —\nTotal $ 154,792 $ 75,616 $ 54,288 $ 13,853 $ 11,035\nMinimum royalties represent the contractual minimum amounts to be paid monthly, quarterly or annually for the right to access mineral properties and mine certain reserves\nand resources. The amounts are generally recoupable against future production royalties to be paid.\nRefer to the previous discussion of Indebtedness above for additional information regarding the Company’s outstanding debt, insurance financing, and finance leases.\nLeases payments in the table above include payments for both financing and operating leases.\nTake-or-pay obligations represent those liquidated damage obligations as determined by contract volume minimums for transportation of coal at the representative rates of\ntransportation or a portion thereof. Additional take-or-pay commitments for the next annual period were renewed after the balance sheet date and have been excluded from the table\nabove. These commitments are estimated at approximately $14 million based on last year’s average rate.\nAsset retirement obligations have been excluded from the table above. Accounting for asset retirement obligations requires a number of estimates, including the amount and\ntiming of payments to satisfy the obligation. The total liability recognized on the Company’s balance sheet for asset retirement obligations was $29.0 million at December 31, 2023.\nRefer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below as well as Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part I in this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor additional information.\nEstimated payments related to worker’s compensation and occupational disease obligations have also been excluded from the table above. Refer to Critical Accounting\nPolicies and Estimates below for additional information related to these obligations. Refer also to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part I in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements, such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds. Liabilities related\nto these arrangements are not reflected in consolidated balance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash\nflows to result from these arrangements. We primarily use surety bonds to secure our financial obligations related to reclamation and other matters. Total surety bonds at December\n31, 2023, were $27.2 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amounts of revenue and expenses\nreported for the period then ended.\n81\nTable of Contents\nCoal Reserves. Our coal reserves and resources are generally updated on an annual basis. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of\ncoal reserves and resources, including many factors beyond our control. As a result, estimates of coal reserves and resources are by their nature uncertain. Information about our\nreserves and resources consists of estimates based on engineering, economic, and geological data assembled by third-party qualified persons. Information used to determine\nrecoverable reserves and resources include geological conditions, historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas, assumed effects of\nregulations and taxes by governmental agencies, assumptions governing future prices, and future operating costs. Each of these may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions\nused in estimating reserves and resources. For these reasons, estimates of economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties, and\nclassification of these reserves and resources based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows, may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues, and\nexpenditures with respect to reserves and resources will likely vary from estimates and these variances may be material. Variances could affect our projected future revenues and\nexpenditures, valuation of coal reserves and resources, and amortization and depletion of mine development costs and mineral rights.\nAsset Retirement Obligations. We initially recognize as a liability an asset retirement obligation, or ARO, associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset in the\nperiod in which it is incurred or a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made, with an associated increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The initially\nrecognized asset retirement cost is amortized using the same method and useful life as the long-lived asset to which it relates. Accretion expense is recognized over time as the\ndiscounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value. The liability is reduced as the reclamation work is performed and the related costs are applied.\nEstimating the ARO requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding timing and existence of a liability, as well as what constitutes adequate restoration.\nInherent in the fair value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate costs, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, and the timing of the\nrelated cash flows. On at least an annual basis, we review our ARO liabilities and make necessary adjustments for significant increases in disturbed acreage, mining permit changes,\nsignificant mine plan revisions, and changes in cost estimates or timing of performance. To the extent future revisions are made to the ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is\nmade to the related asset.\nOur ARO liabilities at December 31, 2023 were nearly flat versus December 31, 2022 as the accretion of the liability during the year and the downward revision to estimates\nwere mostly offsetting. We lowered our inflation per year assumption from 3.75% used in 2022 to 3% in 2023 based on macroeconomic trends. If our assumptions differ from actual\nexperience, or if changes in the regulatory environment occur, our actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different than currently estimated.\nOccupational Disease (Pneumoconiosis) Obligations. We recognize as a liability to provide for occupational illness (pneumoconiosis) benefits to eligible employees,\nformer employees and dependents as required by the Mine Act. The occupational illness benefit obligation represents the present value of the actuarially computed liabilities for\nsuch benefits over the employees’ applicable years of service.\nEstimating the future occupational disease (pneumoconiosis) benefits requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding timing and existence of a liability\nutilizing third-party actuaries to assist in preparing what constitutes adequate liability amounts. Inherent in the calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the\nultimate costs, mortality factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, and timing of settlement. These estimates are subject to uncertainty due to a variety of factors, including limited\nRamaco-specific claim volume and future cost trends. As a result, volatility in future estimates may occur and actual costs could differ significantly from the estimated amounts.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets. We review our held-and-used long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash\nflows of other groups of assets, which is generally at the mine level or at the mining complex level for mines that share infrastructure and/or developed access. Additional judgment\nmay be required for development properties.\n82\nTable of Contents\nEvents and circumstances that may trigger a recoverability assessment include, but are not limited to, a current expectation that a long-lived asset will be disposed of\nsignificantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in\nthe physical condition of the asset(s), and an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected. We generally do not view short-term declines in\nmetallurgical coal prices as a triggering event for conducting impairment tests because of historic price volatility. In addition, a temporary idling of operations at a particular mine or\ncomplex may or may not be viewed as a triggering event depending on the remaining life of the mine, the length of time the mine is expected to be idle, and the amount of incremental\ncosts expected to resume operations.\nWhen events or changes in circumstances occur that trigger a recoverability test, the test is performed by comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and\neventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded for\nthe excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group, if any.\nWe make various assumptions, including assumptions regarding future cash flows in our assessments of long-lived assets for impairment. The assumptions about future\ncash flows and growth rates are based on the current and long-term business plans related to the long-lived assets.\nIncome Taxes. We are required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred income tax liabilities and assets for future\nconsequences of events that have been reflected in our financial statements or tax returns for each tax paying jurisdiction in which we operate. This process requires management to\nmake judgments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact of various agreements and transactions. We initially recognize the effects of a tax position when it is\nmore than 50% likely, based on the technical merits that the position will be sustained upon examination. Our determination of whether or not a tax position has met the recognition\nthreshold depends on the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date.\nWe provide for deferred income taxes for temporary differences arising from differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities existing at each\nbalance sheet date using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance may be recorded to reflect the amount of future tax benefits that management believes are not likely to be realized.\nThe assessment takes into account expectations of future taxable income or loss, available tax planning strategies and the reversal of temporary differences. The development of\nthese expectations involves the use of estimates such as production levels, operating profitability, timing of development activities and the cost and timing of reclamation work. If\nactual outcomes differ from our expectations, we may record an additional valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. The Company\nhad no valuation allowance at December 31, 2023.\nActual income taxes could vary from the estimates and judgments above due to future changes in income tax law, significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we\noperate, our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income, or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year’s liability by taxing authorities. These changes could\nhave a significant impact on our financial position.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements. See Item 8 of Part II, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Recent\nAccounting Pronouncements.”\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk\nIn addition to the risks inherent in operations, we are exposed to financial, market, political and economic risks. The following discussion provides additional detail regarding\nour exposure to the risks related to changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.\nCommodity Price Risk. Our primary product is metallurgical coal, which is in itself a commodity. Sales commitments in the metallurgical coal market are typically not long-\nterm in nature. The Company’s domestic sales contracts have terms of about one year and the pricing is typically fixed. Export sales have spot or term contracts, and pricing is often\nderived from an index. As such, we are exposed to changes in the international price of metallurgical coal.\n83\nTable of Contents\nOur sales commitments as of February 29, 2024 are as follows:\n2024\nVolume Average Price\nNorth America, fixed priced 1.5 $ 167\nSeaborne, fixed priced 0.2 $ 159\nTotal, fixed priced 1.7 $ 166\nIndex priced 2.2\nTotal committed tons 3.9\nSales commitments of 0.4 million tons were obtained subsequent to December 31, 2023, which are included in the table above.\nSales commitments in the metallurgical coal market are typically not long-term in nature and, therefore, we are subject to fluctuations in market pricing. We expect the shift to\nmore export sales in the Company’s mix of revenue that occurred in 2023 to continue during 2024, which may lead to volatility in revenues due to index-based pricing. The Company\ndoes not currently manage this risk through the use of derivative instruments. We also have exposure to price risk for supplies that are used directly or indirectly in the normal course\nof production such as diesel fuel, explosives, and other items. The Company manages its risk for these items through strategic sourcing contracts in normal quantities with our\nsuppliers.\nInterest Rate Risk. We are exposed to risk from changes in interest rates; however, based on the current levels of debt and leases, the Company does not attempt to manage\nour exposure to interest rate fluctuations. we are not overly exposed to interest rate risk. The Company has senior unsecured notes with a face value of $34.5 million that mature on\nJuly 30, 2026, unless redeemed prior to maturity, bearing interest at a fixed rate of 9% per annum and paid quarterly.\nSome of the Company’s debts may be affected by changes in benchmark interest rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR”). Borrowings under the\nCompany’s Revolving Credit Facility, which has a maturity date of February 15, 2026, bear interest at either a base rate plus 1.5% or the applicable SOFR plus 2%. The base rate\nequals the highest of the administrative agent’s prime rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5%, or 3%. The Company’s outstanding financing related to the Maben coal\nacquisition, which had a balance of $11.4 million at December 31, 2023 and is due in full in 2024, bears interest at the applicable SOFR plus 3% compounded monthly.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk. International sales of coal are typically denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, we do not have direct exposure to currency valuation\nexchange rate fluctuations. However, because our coal is sold internationally, to the extent that the U.S. dollar strengthens against the foreign currency of a customer or potential\ncustomer, we may find our coal at a price disadvantage as compared with other non-U.S. suppliers. This could lead to our receiving lower prices or being unable to compete for that\nspecific customer’s business. Consequently, currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal in international markets.\n84\nTable of Contents\nItem 8.

(the \"Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related\nconsolidated statements of operations, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively\nreferred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO”), and our report dated March 14, 2024, expressed an adverse opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws, and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance\nabout whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks\nof material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles\nused and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as\na whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures\nto which they relate.\nCritical Audit Matter – Asset Retirement Obligation Description\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company's asset retirement obligation (\"ARO\") liabilities totaled $29.0 million. As discussed in Note 2 and Note 5 to the financial\nstatements, the Company estimates its ARO liabilities for final reclamation based upon detailed engineering calculations of the amount and timing of the future cash\nspending for a third party to perform the required work. The Company records an ARO asset associated with the discounted liability for final reclamation. The obligation\nand corresponding asset are recognized in the period\n86\nTable of Contents\nin which the liability is incurred. As changes in estimates occur, the revisions to the obligation and asset are recognized at the appropriate credit-adjusted, risk-free\nrate.\nWe identified the valuation of the asset retirement obligation as a critical audit matter because the estimate involves a high degree of subjectivity and auditing the\nsignificant assumptions utilized by management in estimating the amount of the liability requires judgment. In particular, the obligation is determined using a discounted\ncash flow technique and is based upon mining permit requirements and various assumptions including discount rates, inflation rate, estimates of disturbed acreage and\nreclamation activities, timing of reclamation activities, and third-party reclamation costs.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit\nOur principal audit procedures performed to address this critical audit matter included the following:\n● We evaluated the methodology used, and tested the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its estimate.\n● We compared assumptions including the credit-adjusted risk-free rate and inflation rate to current market data. In addition, to assess the estimates of disturbed\nacreage, timing of reclamation activities, and reclamation costs, we evaluated significant changes from the prior estimate.\n● We utilized an external specialist to assist in our assessment of the Company's ARO liability. As part of this effort, the specialist performed a selected\nobservation of mine site operations, interviewed management’s engineering specialist, assessed the completeness of the mine reclamation estimate with respect\nto meeting mine closure and post closure plan regulatory requirements by comparing costs to permits on selected sites, and evaluated the reasonableness of the\nengineering estimates and assumptions.\nCritical Audit Matter – Class B Common Stock Distribution Description\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company created a separate Class B common stock as discussed in Note 9 of the financial statements. An initial\ndistribution of this Class B common stock occurred on June 21, 2023, via a stock dividend to existing holders of common stock as of May 12, 2023. At the date of\ndistribution, each holder of common stock received 0.2 shares of Class B common stock for every one share of existing common stock held on the record date. Similar\nactions or modifications occurred for holders of outstanding stock-based awards. The holders of the Class B shares have different dividend expectations that are subject\nto the sole discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors. Also, the Class B shares do not represent a direct interest in a separate legal entity or direct interest in\nspecific assets.\nThe accounting for this distribution and its effect on other areas of financial reporting involved complex accounting considerations including interpretive guidance. The\nmagnitude of the transaction and uniqueness of the characteristics of the Class B shares required significant research and judgment regarding accounting and\ndisclosure conclusions.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit\nOur principal audit procedures performed to address this critical audit matter included the following:\n● We read the related agreements and analyzed the terms of the Class B equity transaction.\n● We evaluated management’s interpretation and application of the relevant accounting guidance in relation to the facts and circumstances involved and the\nconclusions reached regarding the accounting treatment for this transaction.\n● We evaluated the disclosures surrounding the Class B shares and rights, earnings per share, and fair value, to ensure these were disclosed in accordance with\nthe relevant accounting guidance.\n87\nTable of Contents\n/s/ Cherry Bekaert LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2022 (such date takes into account the acquisition of MCM CPAs & Advisors LLP by Cherry Bekaert LLP effective\nOctober 31, 2023)\nLouisville, Kentucky\nMarch 14, 2024\n88\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and\nStockholders of Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nLexington, Kentucky\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Ramaco Resources, Inc.’s (the \"Company’s”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal\nControl–Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO”). In our opinion, because of the\neffect of the material weakness described in the following paragraph on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013) issued by\nCOSO.\nA material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a\nmaterial misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has\nbeen identified and included in management’s assessment. Management identified a material weakness related to a pervasive lack of sufficient documentation of\naccounting policies, procedures, and controls. This lack of sufficient documentation does not allow management to effectively assess its relevant risks and key controls\nto properly test for design and operating effectiveness. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our\naudit of the 2023 financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 14, 2024, on those financial statements.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB”), the consolidated balance\nsheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, equity, and cash flows of the Company, and our report dated March 14, 2024, expressed an unqualified\nopinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A–Controls and\nProcedures in the Company’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting\nbased on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance\nabout whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included\nobtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial\n89\nTable of Contents\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions\nand dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with\nauthorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,\nuse, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Cherry Bekaert LLP\nLouisville, Kentucky\nMarch 14, 2024\n90\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nStockholders and the Board of Directors of Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nLexington, Kentucky\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, equity, and cash flows of Ramaco Resources, Inc.

(the \"Company,” \"Ramaco,” \"we,” \"us,” or \"our”) is a Delaware corporation formed in October 2016. Our principal corporate and executive offices\nare located in Lexington, Kentucky with operational offices in Charleston, West Virginia and Sheridan, Wyoming. We are an operator and developer of high-quality, low-cost\nmetallurgical coal in southern West Virginia and southwestern Virginia. We believe each of these properties possesses geologic and logistical advantages that make our coal among\nthe lowest delivered-cost U.S. metallurgical coal to our domestic target customer base, North American blast furnace steel mills and coke plants, as well as international metallurgical\ncoal consumers. We also control mineral deposits near Sheridan, Wyoming as part of the Company’s initiatives regarding the potential recovery of rare earth elements as well as the\npotential commercialization of coal-to-carbon-based products and materials.\nAlthough conflicts overseas continue and global economic growth remains uncertain, supply constraints support the global metallurgical coal market. Ongoing bans on the\nimport of Russian coal have affected the availability of supply to certain seaborne markets as well as contributed to volatility in coal prices.\nNOTE 2—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation—The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP”) and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. The financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis\nfor all periods presented. All significant intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior year amounts in\nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements have been adjusted to conform to current presentation.\nUse of estimates—The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\nduring the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates are related to the quantity and value of coal inventories, stock-based\ncompensation, asset retirement obligations, occupational disease obligations, evaluation of long-lived assets for impairment, quantities and values of coal reserves, depletion and\namortization, useful lives, and income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition—Our primary source of revenue is from the sale of coal through contracts with steel producers usually having durations of less than one year.\nRevenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with our customers are satisfied. This occurs when control of the coal is transferred to our\ncustomers. For coal shipments to domestic customers via rail, control is generally transferred when the railcar is loaded. Control is transferred for export coal shipments to customers\nvia ocean vessel when the vessel is loaded at the port.\nOur coal sales generally include up to 90-day payment terms following the transfer of control of the goods to our customer. In the case of some of our foreign customers, our\ncontracts also require that letters of credit are posted to secure payment of any outstanding receivable. We do not include extended payment terms in our contracts. Our contracts\nwith customers typically provide for minimum specifications or qualities of the coal we deliver. Variances from these specifications or qualities are settled by means of price\nadjustments. Generally, these price adjustments are settled within 30 days of delivery and are insignificant.\nCertain of our contracts with customers include provisions in which the price is derived from an index. If control of the goods transfers to the customer in the period before\nthe final price is determined, revenue is recorded based on the estimated consideration to be received. The Company estimates the amount to which it expects to receive by reference\nto forward curve data, if available, and generally does not constrain such estimates for accounting purposes\n96\nTable of Contents\ndue to the short period of time over which the uncertainty is resolved. However, certain estimates of provisional pricing for which no forward curve data was available were\nconstrained at December 31, 2023 due to index volatility.\nFreight Revenue and Expense—Costs incurred to transport coal to the point of sale at the port facility are included in cost of sales and the gross amounts billed to\ncustomers to cover shipping to and handling of the coal at the port are included in revenue.\nCash and Cash Equivalents—We classify all highly-liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents. Restricted cash balances at\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $0.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively, and consisted of funds held in escrow for potential future workers’ compensation claims.\nRestricted cash balances were included in other current assets on the balance sheet. The Company pools individual bank accounts with the same institution for the purpose of\nassessing if a bank overdraft exists based on the contractual terms of the arrangement.\nInventories— Coal is reported as inventory at the point in time it is extracted from the mine. Coal inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value,\nwith cost determined on a first-in, first-out inventory valuation method. Coal inventory costs include labor, supplies, equipment costs, freight, operating overhead, depreciation and\namortization. Coal inventory quantities are adjusted periodically based on aerial surveys of coal stockpiles. Lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments were not material. Supply\ninventories are valued at average cost. Inventories consisted of the following:\n(In thousands) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nRaw coal $ 20,122 $ 22,414\nSaleable coal 12,013 18,223\nSupplies 5,028 4,336\nTotal inventories $ 37,163 $ 44,973\nProperty, Plant and Equipment—Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures which extend the useful lives of existing plant and equipment are\ncapitalized. Planned major maintenance costs which do not extend the useful lives of existing plant and equipment are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise\ndisposed, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any profit or loss on disposition is recognized in the consolidated statements\nof operations.\nCoal exploration costs are expensed as incurred. Coal exploration costs include those incurred to ascertain existence, location, extent or quality of ore or minerals before\nbeginning the development stage of the mine.\nMining property and mineral rights costs represent the costs incurred to acquire the rights to access and mine certain coal property either through deeds, leases, or other\nconveyance agreements. These costs include the costs of acquiring, and accessing mineral reserves, resources and surface areas for mining activities.\nMine development begins when the facts and circumstances clearly establish the presence of a commercial mineralized deposit. Capitalized mine development costs\nrepresent the costs incurred to prepare mine sites and/or seams of coal for future mining. These costs include costs of acquiring, permitting, planning, research, and developing\naccess to identified mineral reserves and other preparations for commercial production as necessary to develop and permit the properties for mining activities. When components of\ncapitalized mine development costs are replaced with new components, the Company capitalizes the replacement as a separate component and charges off the net book value of the\ncomponent that was replaced at the cease-use date.\nIf it is determined that an undeveloped mineral interest cannot be economically converted into proven and probable reserves, capitalized costs are assessed for impairment\nand future development costs are expensed as incurred.\n97\nTable of Contents\nOperating expenditures, including certain professional fees and overhead costs, are not capitalized but are expensed as incurred.\nMineral rights and capitalized mine development costs are depleted and amortized on a units-of-production basis as mining of that mine’s assigned reserves takes place.\nDepreciation of plant and equipment is calculated on the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to thirty years.\nAdvanced Coal Royalties—In most cases, we acquire the right to mine coal reserves under leases which call for the payment of royalties on coal as it is mined and sold. In\nmany cases, these mineral leases require the payment of advance or minimum coal royalties to lessors that are recoupable against future production royalties. These advance\npayments are deferred and charged to operations as the coal reserves are mined.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets—We review and evaluate held-and-used long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and mine development costs, for\nimpairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset or asset group’s carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparing the\ncarrying amount of the asset or asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of the asset\nor asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value, if any. We\nmay, under limited circumstances, idle mining operations in response to certain events or conditions. Because an idling is not a permanent closure, it is not considered an automatic\nindicator of impairment.\nAsset Retirement Obligations—Legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets are initially recognized at their estimated fair value, with a\ncorresponding charge to capitalized development costs, at the time they are incurred. Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates related to reclaiming\nmetallurgical coal land and support facilities in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws as defined by each mining permit. Spending estimates are adjusted for inflation and\nthen discounted at the credit-adjusted, risk-free rate. We record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding\nincrease in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted to its present value over time and the capitalized cost is amortized using the units-of-\nproduction method over estimated recoverable reserves upon commencement of mining. We review our asset retirement obligations on at least an annual basis for significant\nchanges in the estimated timing or amount of cash flows.\nOccupational Disease (Pneumoconiosis) Obligations. We recognize as a liability to provide for occupational disease (pneumoconiosis) benefits to eligible employees,\nformer employees and dependents as required by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1969, as amended. The occupational disease benefit obligation represents the present\nvalue of the actuarially computed liabilities for such benefits over the employees’ applicable years of service.\nEstimating our occupational disease (pneumoconiosis) benefits obligation requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding timing and existence of a liability\nutilizing third-party actuaries to assist in preparing what constitutes adequate liability amounts. Inherent in the calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the\nultimate costs, mortality factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, and timing of settlement. Adjustments to estimated liabilities due to changes in actuarial assumptions are recorded\nimmediately in earnings in the period in which the change in estimate occurs.\nOther Income—We recognized $5.4 million associated with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act Employee Retention Tax Credit as other income within\nthe consolidated statements of operations for 2021.\nLeases—We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception, and lease classification is determined at the commencement date. Leases are recognized\non the balance sheet as right-of-use (\"ROU”) assets and lease liabilities except for leases with a term of 12 months or less.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.\nOperating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of the fixed lease payments over the lease term. The\n98\nTable of Contents\nCompany does not separate lease and non-lease components for all leases as permitted under the accounting guidance for leases. As most of our leases do not contain a readily\ndeterminable implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments\nat commencement date. The operating and finance lease ROU assets also include lease prepayments made by the Company and are reduced by any lease incentives received by the\nCompany prior to commencement. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. For operating\nleases, lease expense is recorded in the income statement based on a straight-line recognition of the total fixed payments over the lease term. For finance leases, accretion of the\nliability is recognized as interest expense and the ROU asset is amortized separately on a straight-line basis similar to the depreciation of equipment owned by the Company.\nLeases of mineral reserves and the related land leases are exempted under U.S. GAAP from recognition on the consolidated balance sheets.\nFair Value Measurements— Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value are categorized in the fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the\ninputs utilized in the valuation. The levels of the hierarchy include: Level 1 - inputs are quoted prices in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 - inputs are other\nthan quoted prices included in Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable through market-corroborated inputs; and Level 3 - inputs are unobservable, or observable but cannot\nbe market-corroborated, requiring us to make assumptions about pricing by market participants.\nThe fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, and accounts payable approximate their carrying amounts at each reporting date. The\nCompany’s Senior Notes had an estimated fair value of $35.5 million and $36.3 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The fair values of the Company’s Senior Notes\nwere based on observable market prices and were considered a Level 2 measurement at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 based on trading volumes. The difference between\nthe fair value and carrying amount of the Company’s remaining debts is not material due to the similarity between the terms of the debt agreements and prevailing market terms\navailable to the Company. Refer to Note 7 for additional information regarding debt.\nNonrecurring fair value measurements of the Company include asset retirement obligations and estimated values used to allocate the acquisition cost of long-lived assets to\nindividual assets, neither of which are subject to the fair value disclosure requirements.\nThe fair value of asset retirement obligations is determined as the present value of estimated cash flows related to reclamation obligations, which would likely be a Level 3\nmeasurement due to the use of unobservable inputs such as estimates regarding the amount and timing of costs to be incurred, inflation rates, and the Company’s credit-adjusted\ndiscount rate.\nThe consideration for the Company’s prior year acquisitions was allocated based on the relative fair values of the assets acquired, the primary asset of which was mineral\nrights. The fair values of mineral rights were determined based on Level 3 inputs, which are generally unobservable, requiring the Company to make assumptions about future coal\nprices, capital expenditures, future coal production, costs of production, and an appropriate rate at which to discount the future cash flows.\nIncome Taxes—Income tax expense (benefit) includes Federal and state income taxes. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in\nthe same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. We account for deferred income taxes by applying statutory tax rates in effect at the\nreporting date of the balance sheet. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized. In determining the appropriate\nvaluation allowance, we consider the projected realization of tax benefits based on expected levels of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies and reversals of existing\ntaxable temporary differences. The Company had no valuation allowances on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n99\nTable of Contents\nUncertain tax positions are recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical\nmerits of the position. We had no uncertain tax positions requiring liability recognition as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. We file income tax returns in the U.S. and in various state\nand local jurisdictions which may be routinely examined by tax authorities. The statute of limitations for examination of the Company’s tax filings by taxing authorities is currently\nopen for tax returns filed for the year 2020 and thereafter.\nThe Company recognizes accrued interest related to income tax matters in interest expense, net, separately from the tax provision recorded in income tax expense on the\nincome statement.\nSegment Reporting—Our properties located in West Virginia and Virginia each consist of mineral reserves for production of metallurgical coal from both underground and\nsurface mines. These operations are within the Appalachian basin. Geology, coal transportation routes to customers, regulatory environments and coal quality or type are\ncharacteristic to a basin. For financial reporting purposes, these operations represent a single segment because each possesses similar production methods, distribution methods,\nand customer quality and consumption characteristics, resulting in similar long-term expected financial performance.\nThe Ramaco Coal acquisition in 2022, as discussed in greater detail in Note 4, provides the Company with royalty savings and controlled mineral rights near Sheridan,\nWyoming. This property includes a thermal coal deposit and permit and is currently undergoing mineral analysis and core drilling to assess potential concentrations of rare earth\nelements. The property also includes a research and pilot facility related to the Company’s possible expansion into the manufacturing and commercialization of advanced carbon\nproducts and materials from coal. Research and development expenses related to advanced carbon products and materials are not yet material for separate disclosure. Ramaco is also\na party to certain collaborative arrangements with government researchers and other organizations, which involve providing in-kind contributions such as ores, samples, feedstock,\nand services.\nThe activities at the Sheridan property represent a separate operating segment and have economic and geographic differences compared to the Company’s metallurgical\noperations in the Appalachian basin. Nonetheless, these activities do not meet the significance tests for separate disclosure as a reportable segment at this time.\nThe chief operating decision maker does not regularly review segment asset information for the purpose of assessing performance and making resource allocation decisions.\nStock-Based Compensation—Compensation cost for equity awards is based on the grant-date fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period.\nForfeitures are recognized as they occur.\nThe fair values of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards having only a service condition were determined using the publicly-traded price of our common stock on\nthe grant date. The fair value of performance stock units, which vest based on the achievement of relative total shareholder return goals, was determined on the date of grant based\non a Monte Carlo simulation. The fair value of stock option awards was calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes model requires us to make\nassumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation, including the expected term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, dividend rate and service period.\nConcentrations—Our current operations are all related to metallurgical coal within the mining industry. A reduction in metallurgical coal prices or other disturbances in the\nmetallurgical coal markets could have an adverse effect on our financial results. In 2023, 2022, and 2021, approximately 33%, 58%, and 51%, respectively, of our revenue was derived\nfrom coal shipments to customers in North American markets. The decrease in North American revenue in 2023 was due to sales within the United States.\nDuring 2023, sales to three customers accounted for 15%, 13%, and 13% of our revenues, or collectively 41% of total revenue. During 2022, sales to two customers\naccounted for 21% and 17% of our revenues, or collectively 38% of total revenue. During 2021, sales to three customers accounted for 30%, 15%, and 13% of our revenues, or\n100\nTable of Contents\ncollectively 58% of total revenue. The number of customers comprising the concentrations above is based on a threshold of 10% or more of total revenues.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and accounts\nreceivable. We monitor the credit ratings and concentration of risk with financial institutions on a continuing basis to safeguard our cash deposits. In addition, the Company is party\nto an arrangement that began in 2023 whereby our cash and cash equivalents are placed at various banks in amounts no greater than the $250,000 FDIC-insured limit to help\nsafeguard against potential losses in the financial sector.\nWe have a limited number of customers. Contracts with these customers provide for billings principally upon shipment and compliance with payment terms is monitored on\nan ongoing basis. Outstanding receivables beyond payment terms are promptly investigated and discussed with the specific customer. We estimate an allowance for credit losses by\ntaking into consideration the age of past due accounts and an assessment of our customers’ ability to pay. An allowance for credit losses was not necessary as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022.\nThree customers accounted for 22%, 19%, and 15%, of our trade receivables, or collectively 56% of the Company’s accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2023. The\nnumber of customers comprising the concentrations above is based on a threshold of 10% or more of total accounts receivable.\nRecent Accounting Standards Updates\nIn October 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU”) 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification\nAmendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative (\"ASU 2023-06”). The amendments in ASU 2023-06 clarify or improve disclosure and\npresentation requirements for a variety of topics, including debt and earnings per share. The effective date for each amendment in ASU 2023-06 will be the effective date of the SEC’s\nremoval of that related disclosure from existing SEC regulations, and each amendment should be applied prospectively after its effective date. A material impact to our disclosures is\nnot expected at this time since the Company is already subject to existing SEC disclosure requirements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (\"ASU 2023-07”). The amendments in\nASU 2023-07 require incremental disclosures related to a public entity’s reportable segments and increase the frequency with which most segment disclosures are made. Incremental\ndisclosures required by the ASU include significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM”) and included within the segment’s\nmeasure of profit or loss, the title and position of the CODM and an explanation how the CODM uses the reported measure of a segment’s profit or loss to assess performance and\nallocate resources, and the amount and composition of other segment items necessary to reconcile segment revenue, significant expenses, and the reported measure of profit or loss.\nThe ASU also expands interim disclosure requirements such that nearly all annual quantitative segment disclosures will be made on an interim basis and requires that entities with a\nsingle reportable segment provide all segment disclosures that are not evident from the primary financial statements, including significant segment expenses, consistent with the\napproach used by management to evaluate performance. ASU 2023-07 is effective starting with Ramaco’s 2024 annual financial statements and on a quarterly basis thereafter.\nRetrospective application is required. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU; however, incremental disclosures will likely occur upon adoption.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (\"ASU 2023-09”). The amendments in ASU 2023-09\nrequire reporting entities to disclose annual income taxes paid, net of refunds, disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes and to provide additional disaggregated information\nfor individual jurisdictions that equal or exceed 5% of total income taxes paid, net of refunds. ASU 2023-09 also requires public business entities to disclose additional categories of\ninformation about federal, state, and foreign income taxes in their annual rate reconciliation table and provide more information about some categories if the quantitative threshold is\nmet. The ASU will also require disclosure of amounts and percentages in the annual rate reconciliation table, rather than amounts or percentages, and will eliminate certain existing\ndisclosure requirements related to uncertain tax positions and unrecognized deferred tax liabilities.

The other mines\nresumed production while the Berwind No. 1 mine was idled until a full investigation could be conducted. There were no personnel in the mine at the time of the incident and no\ninjuries or fatalities occurred. The overall impact to pre-tax earnings in 2022 was immaterial except for idle mine costs of $9.5 million recognized during the year. Production from the\nBerwind No. 1 mine restarted in the first quarter of 2023. The Company received $9.2 million of insurance proceeds during 2023 related to this matter, which have been reported as part\nof Insurance proceeds related to property, plant, and equipment in the investing activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, and recognized a gain of $8.1\nmillion in Other income (expense), net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations in 2023 as the Company had previously accrued a $1.1 million recovery asset at December 31,\n2022.\nMining property and mineral rights are made up primarily of significant asset acquisitions that occurred in 2022 and 2021. Refer to Note 4 for more information.\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization included:\nYear ended December 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nDepreciation of plant and equipment $ 30,913 $ 24,132 $ 17,945\nAmortization of right-of-use assets (finance leases) 8,547 4,846 1,109\nAmortization and depletion of capitalized\nmine development costs and mineral rights 14,792 12,216 7,151\nTotal depreciation, depletion, and amortization $ 54,252 $ 41,194 $ 26,205\nNOTE 4—ACQUISITIONS\nRamaco Coal\nOn April 29, 2022, the acquisition of Ramaco Coal, an entity owned by an investment fund managed by Yorktown Partners and certain members of the Company's\nmanagement, was completed pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated February 23, 2022. The purchase price was approximately $65 million, consisting of an initial payment\nof $10 million paid at closing and a deferred purchase price of $55 million paid during the remainder of 2022 in\n102\nTable of Contents\n$5 million ratable quarterly installments, and $10 million ratable quarterly installments paid in 2023 plus interest at a rate of 9%.\nRamaco Coal controls certain coal mineral interests of principally metallurgical coal properties which are owned in fee or leased under long-term leases that are, in turn, leased\nor subleased to the Company and various third parties. Such lessees pay a royalty based on the amount of metallurgical coal mined and the realized price per ton.\nRamaco Coal also controls a large thermal coal deposit and permit near Sheridan, Wyoming covering approximately 16 thousand acres, including a research and development\nfacility and associated equipment and has a goal of converting coal to carbon products, such as graphene, graphite and carbon fiber.\nConcurrent with this acquisition, the Company and Ramaco Coal each sold certain mineral rights located in West Virginia (the \"Split Ridge Arrangement”). To compensate\nfor the sale of these rights, we received an overriding royalty arrangement which included $2 million up front and $125 thousand quarterly minimum royalty payment beginning in\nJanuary 2024 until December 2028. The fair value of this arrangement was $3.7 million, of which, $1.6 million was treated as an allocation of the fair value of this disposed component\nof Ramaco Coal and, separately, a $2.1 million gain on the sale of the Company’s mineral rights included in Other income (expense), net on the 2022 Consolidated Statement of\nOperations.\nThe acquisition of Ramaco Coal was accounted for as a purchase of assets due to substantially all of the fair value being concentrated in a single asset, the rights to\nmetallurgical coal deposits. The consideration paid in connection with the acquisition of Ramaco Coal, including $1.6 million in closing costs, relinquishment of $1.6 million of prepaid\nroyalties and $0.1 million paid to a mineral owner as part of the acquisition, was approximately $68.3 million and was allocated based on fair values to mining property and mineral\nrights ($65.1 million), buildings ($2.6 million) and equipment ($0.6 million). Refer to Note 7 for a description of the acquisition financing.\nMaben Coal\nOn September 23, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of Maben Coal, LLC (\"Maben Coal”) pursuant to the Securities Purchase\nAgreement dated August 8, 2022, with Appleton Coal, LLC. The purchase price was approximately $30.0 million, consisting of an initial payment of $9.0 million and proceeds from a\nnew two-year loan in the amount of $21.0 million. The Company also paid approximately $1.7 million of transaction costs and recognized liabilities of $1.3 million on the closing date,\nprimarily related to $1.2 million of cash bond replacement obligations incurred by the Company as part of the transaction. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company paid off the $1.2\nmillion cash bond replacement obligation to Appleton Coal, LLC, which was included in the investing activities section of the statement of cash flows. The $1.2 million bond\nreplacement payment was subsequently recovered in 2023, which reduced the cash investment related to this transaction to $10.7 million.\nWe acquired a large coal deposit on approximately 28 thousand leased acres located in Wyoming County and Raleigh County, West Virginia. We assumed existing mining\npermits issued by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection, which authorizes mining by both surface and highwall mining methods as well as by underground\nmethods. The property also has issued permits covering an existing haul road, as well as an active refuse disposal area together with a preparation plant and unit train loadout, neither\nof which had been constructed as of the closing date.\nThe acquisition of Maben Coal was accounted for as a purchase of assets due to substantially all of the fair value being concentrated in a single asset, the rights to leased\nmetallurgical coal deposits. The total consideration of approximately $33.0 million was allocated to mining property and mineral rights ($30.6 million), capitalized mine development\ncosts ($1.0 million), receivable for the right to recover cash bond replacement payments made by the Company as discussed above ($1.2 million, which was received in 2023), and\nrecoupable royalties ($0.2 million). Refer to Note 7 for information regarding the acquisition financing.\n103\nTable of Contents\nAmonate Assets\nIn December 2021, we acquired what are referred to as the \"Amonate Assets” from Coronado, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. The acquisition, for a total cash\nconsideration of $30 million, included a mine complex located in McDowell County, West Virginia and Tazewell County, Virginia adjacent and contiguous to the Company’s existing\nBerwind Complex. The acquisition primarily consists of high-quality, low and mid-vol metallurgical coal reserves and resources, much of which will be mined from the Company’s\nBerwind Complex. Also purchased were several additional permitted mines and a currently idled 1.3-million-ton per annum capacity coal preparation plant. The Company paid an\nadditional $0.6 million in 2023 for transaction-related costs, which was also included in investing activities since the delay in payment was due to administrative reasons rather than\nfinancing.\nNOTE 5—ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\nWe estimate asset retirement obligations (\"ARO”) for final reclamation based upon detailed engineering calculations of the amount and timing of the future cash spending\nfor a third party to perform the required work.

The Company sponsors a defined contribution plan to assist eligible employees in providing for their future\nretirement needs. Contribution expenses related to the plan totaled $3.1 million, $2.3 million, and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nOther long-term liabilities were comprised primarily of worker’s compensation and occupational disease obligations discussed below.\nWorkers’ Compensation and Occupational Disease Obligations\nWe are self-insured for certain losses relating to workers’ compensation claims and occupational disease obligations under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1969,\nas amended. Starting in 2023, the Company also elected to self-insure employee medical expenses. We purchase insurance coverage to reduce our exposure to significant levels of\nthese claims. Self-insured losses are accrued based upon estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims incurred as of the balance sheet date using claims data and actuarial\nassumptions. The occupational disease benefit obligation represents the present value of the actuarially computed liabilities for such benefits over the employees’ applicable years of\nservice. The occupational disease benefit liability was calculated using a discount rate of 5.3% and 5.6% at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the estimated aggregate liability for uninsured claims totaled $5.2 million, including $2.3 million of occupational disease obligations.

We are authorized to issue up to a total of 225,000,000 shares of Class A common\nstock and 35,000,000 shares of Class B common stock as well as 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, each having a par value of $0.01 per share.\nThe initial distribution of Class B common stock occurred on June 21, 2023 via a stock dividend to existing holders of common stock as of May 12, 2023. On the date of initial\ndistribution, each holder of common stock received 0.2 shares of Class B common stock for every one share of existing common stock held on the record date. Similar actions or\nmodifications occurred for holders of outstanding stock-based awards.\nThe distribution of the Class B common stock provides existing holders of the Company’s common stock with an opportunity to participate directly in the financial\nperformance of the Company’s CORE assets on a stand-alone basis, separate from the Company’s metallurgical coal operations. CORE assets were acquired initially as part of the\nCompany’s acquisition of Ramaco Coal in the second quarter of 2022. The financial performance of CORE assets consists of the following non-cost-bearing revenue streams based\non the Company’s current expectations:\n● Royalty fees derived from the royalties associated with the Ramaco Coal and Amonate reserves, which we believe approximates 3% of Company-produced coal sales\nrevenue excluding coal sales revenue from Knox Creek,\n● Infrastructure fees based on $5.00 per ton of coal processed at our preparation plants and $2.50 per ton of loaded coal at the Company’s rail load-out facilities, and\n● Future income derived, if and when realized, from advanced carbon products and rare earth elements initiatives.\n108\nTable of Contents\nThe Company expects to pay a dividend equal to 20% of the total fees above; however, any dividend amounts declared and paid are subject to the sole discretion of the\nCompany’s Board of Directors.\nIn addition, the Board of Directors retains the power to change or add expense allocation policies related to CORE, redefine CORE assets, and redetermine CORE’s per-ton\nusage fees at any time, in its sole discretion, without shareholder approval. Holders of shares of Class A common stock continue to be entitled to receive dividends when and if\ndeclared by the Board of Directors subject to any statutory or contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and to any prior rights and preferences that may be applicable to\noutstanding preferred stock, if any.\nCORE is not a separate legal entity and holders of Class B common stock do not own a direct interest in the assets of CORE. Holders of Class B common stock are\nstockholders of Ramaco Resources, Inc. and are subject to all risks and liabilities of the Company as a whole.\nWith respect to voting rights, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the\nstockholders and are entitled to one vote per share. The holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of\ndirectors. Class B common stock does not have any specific voting rights or governance rights with respect to CORE.\nWith respect to liquidation rights, holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably the assets available for distribution to the stockholders after payment of liabilities\nand the liquidation preference of outstanding preferred stock, if any. That is, the rights to residual net assets upon liquidation are equal between holders of Class A and Class B\ncommon stock. Holders of Class B common stock do not have specific rights to CORE assets in the event of liquidation.\nShares of Class A common stock have no preemptive or conversion rights and are not subject to further calls or assessment by us. There are no redemption or sinking fund\nprovisions applicable to Class A common stock. The Board of Directors retains the ability, in its sole discretion, to exchange all outstanding shares of Class B common stock into\nClass A common stock based on an exchange ratio determined by a 20-day trailing volume-weighted average price for each class of stock.\nThe initial distribution of the tracking stock was recorded as a stock dividend at fair value, which was estimated to be $11.00 per share based on the closing price of Class B\nshares on the first day of regular-way trading. The effect of the equity restructuring was a $102.9 million reduction in retained earnings and an increase of $102.9 million to Class B\ncommon stock and additional paid-in capital during the second quarter of 2023. The Company initially distributed 8,201,956 shares of Class B common shares as well as additional\nrestricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance stock units discussed below.\nStock-Based Compensation Awards\nOutstanding stock-based awards were reclassified to Class A common stock as part of the equity restructuring discussed above. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the\nCompany’s outstanding stock-based awards, equitable adjustments were made in accordance with such terms, as discussed below, based on the same factor of 0.2 for every\noutstanding award. Since there were no changes in fair value, vesting conditions, or award classification, no incremental compensation expense resulted.\nOur Long-Term Incentive Plan (\"LTIP”) is currently authorized by shareholders for the issuance of awards of up to approximately 10.9 million shares of common stock. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, there were approximately 4.6 million shares of common stock available for grant under the LTIP. The one-time distribution of Class B has no bearing on the\nauthorization under the LTIP.\nIn general, granted but unvested shares are forfeited upon termination of employment, unless an employee enters into another written arrangement. However, exceptions\nexist for certain executives that are entitled to accelerated vesting if terminated without cause. Granted but unvested shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or\notherwise encumbered.\n109\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had four types of stock-based awards outstanding: stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance stock units. Stock-\nbased compensation expense for all stock-based awards totaled $12.9 million in 2023, $8.2 million in 2022, and $5.3 million in 2021.\nStock Options—We granted options for the purchase of a total of 937,424 shares of our common stock for $5.34 per share to two executives on August 31, 2016. The options\nhave a ten-year term from the grant date and are fully vested. During the third quarter of 2022, options to purchase 20,000 shares of common stock options with an intrinsic value of\n$0.124 million were exercised, leaving a balance of options to purchase 917,424 shares of common stock at December 31, 2022. During 2023, stock options of 183,484 shares of Class B\nawards were distributed to these individuals under the equitable adjustments discussed above. During the fourth quarter of 2023, options to purchase 168,712 shares of Class A\ncommon stock were exercised and stock options for 33,742 shares of Class B common stock were exercised having a combined intrinsic value of $2.6 million. The remaining options\noutstanding and unexercised at December 31, 2023 were 748,712 for Class A common stock and 149,742 for Class B common stock, which were in-the-money at December 31, 2023,\nhaving a total intrinsic value of $10.9 million. No compensation expense was recognized for these awards in 2023, 2022, or 2021 as the awards became fully vested in previous years.\nThe following table summarizes the remaining stock-based awards outstanding, as well as activity for the periods:\nRestricted Stock Restricted Stock Units Performance Stock Units\nWeighted Weighted Weighted\nAverage Grant Average Grant Average Grant\nFor Class A common stock: Shares Date Fair Value Shares Date Fair Value Shares Date Fair Value\nOutstanding at December 31, 2021 3,741,770$ 3.98 — $ — — $ —\nGranted 214,363 14.59 248,706 15.65 248,706 22.21\nVested (809,539) 6.57 (82,903) 15.65 — —\nForfeited (637) 15.65 — — — —\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 3,145,957$ 4.04 165,803 $ 15.65 248,706 $ 22.21\nGranted 296,115 10.61 518,348 10.61 518,348 18.09\nVested (1,695,234) 3.37 (82,903) 15.65 — —\nForfeited (38,484) 11.90 — — — —\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 1,708,354$ 5.66 601,248 $ 11.30 767,054 $ 19.43\nFor Class B common stock:\nInitial distribution of Class B awards -\nJune 21, 2023 680,718 136,819 153,404\nVested (339,035) (16,578) —\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 341,683 120,241 153,404\nThe total fair value of awards vested was $19.7 million during 2023, $11.0 million during 2022, and $5.1 million during 2021.\nRestricted Stock—We grant shares of restricted stock to certain senior executives, key employees and directors. These shares vest over approximately one to three and a\nhalf years from the date of grant. During the vesting period, the participants have voting rights and may receive dividends. Upon vesting, the restricted stock becomes unrestricted\ncommon shares. The fair value of the restricted stock on the date of the grant is amortized ratably over the service period. At December 31, 2023, there was $3.2 million of total\nunrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years. The fair value of restricted stock awards that\nvested during 2023 was $14.6 million for Class A awards and $3.6 million for Class B awards. The fair value of the outstanding restricted stock awards was $29.3 million for Class A\nawards and $4.5 million for Class B awards based on the year-end 2023 closing stock prices.\n110\nTable of Contents\nRestricted Stock Units—We grant shares of restricted stock units to certain senior executives and key employees. These share units vest ratably over approximately\nthree years from the date of grant. During the vesting period, the participants have no voting rights and no dividend rights; however, participants are entitled to receive dividend\nequivalents, which shall be subject to the same conditions applicable to the units and payable at the time the units vest. Upon vesting and within 30 days thereafter, the recipient will\nreceive one share of common stock for each stock unit.\nThe grant date fair values of restricted stock units are recognized ratably over the service period. At December 31, 2023, there was $5.2 million of total unrecognized\ncompensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units to be recognized over the weighted average period of 1.7 years. The fair value of restricted stock unit awards that vested\nduring 2023 was $1.3 million for Class A awards and $0.2 million for Class B awards. The fair value of the outstanding restricted stock unit awards was $10.3 million for Class A awards\nand $1.6 million for Class B awards based on the year-end 2023 closing stock prices.\nPerformance Stock Units—We grant shares of performance stock units to certain senior executives and key employees. These share units cliff-vest approximately\nthree years from the date of grant based on the achievement of targeted performance levels related to pre-established relative total shareholder return goals. These performance stock\nunits have the potential to be earned from 0% to 200% of target depending on actual results. During the vesting period, the participants have no voting rights and no dividend rights;\nhowever, participants are entitled to receive dividend equivalents, which shall be subject to the same conditions applicable to the units and payable at the time the units vest. Upon\nvesting and within 30 days thereafter, the recipient will receive one share of common stock for each stock unit.\nThe Company’s performance stock units were valued relative to the stock price performance of a peer group of companies, which was based on a Monte Carlo simulation.\nThe fair value of the performance stock units on the date of the grant is recognized ratably over the service period. At December 31, 2023, there was $8.9 million of total unrecognized\ncompensation cost related to unvested performance stock units to be recognized over the weighted average period of 1.7 years. The combined intrinsic value of the outstanding\nperformance stock units for both classes, at target, was $15.2 million at December 31, 2023. The value of these awards if the performance period had ended on December 31, 2023 is\nestimated at approximately $27 million.\nIn addition, performance stock units granted in 2022 were modified during the first quarter of 2023. Modifications to these awards were made up primarily of changes in the\ncomposition of the peer group as well as changes in the way relative total shareholder return is evaluated against the updated peer group. The modification resulted in incremental fair\nvalue of $1.2 million, which is recognized as expense over 2023 and 2024.\nPerformance stock units are accounted for as awards with a market condition since vesting depends on total shareholder return relative to a group of peer companies.\nTaxes Related to Stock Awards—The Company routinely allows employees to surrender common stock to pay estimated taxes upon the vesting or exercise of stock-based\ncompensation awards. The value of common stock tendered by employees is determined based on the price of the Company’s common stock at the time of relinquishment. There\nwere no other repurchases of common shares.\nDividends\nDividends in the amount of $16.6 million, or approximately $0.375 per share on an aggregated basis ($0.125 per share for three quarterly dividends), were declared and paid to\nholders of common stock or Class A common stock during 2023. On December 6, 2023, the Company announced that the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on Class A\ncommon stock of $0.1375 per share to be paid on March 15, 2024 to shareholders of record on March 1, 2024. Dividends of $6.0 million were accrued in December 2023 for the cash\ndividend to be paid in March 2024.\n111\nTable of Contents\nThe Company also paid dividends to holders of Class B common stock during 2023 based on 20% of CORE royalty and infrastructure fees. Dividends in the amount of $1.5\nmillion, or approximately $0.165 per share of Class B common stock, were paid on September 15, 2023 to shareholders of record on September 1, 2023. Dividends in the amount of $2.2\nmillion, or $0.249 per share of Class B common stock, were paid on December 15, 2023 to shareholders of record on December 1, 2023. Refer to Note 15 for information regarding\ndividends declared for holders of Class B common stock subsequent to the date of the financial statements.\nFor the full year 2023, the Company recognized $27.5 million of cash dividends declared against retained earnings for all classes of common stock, including $6.0 million of\ndividends declared in December 2023 to be paid in March 2024 and $1.2 million of forfeitable dividends subject to the vesting conditions of outstanding restricted stock units and\nperformance stock units. For the full year 2023, the Company paid $25.8 million of cash dividends for both classes of common stock, including $5.5 million that were accrued at\nDecember 31, 2022.\nFor 2022, the Company recognized $23.1 million of cash dividends declared against retained earnings, or approximately $0.52 per share, including $5.5 million that were\nunpaid as of December 31, 2022. For the full year 2022, the Company paid $20.0 million of dividends, including $2.5 million that were accrued at December 31, 2021.\nNOTE 10—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nEnvironmental Liabilities—Environmental liabilities are recognized when the expenditures are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. Measurement of\nliabilities is based on currently enacted laws and regulations, existing technology and undiscounted site-specific costs. Generally, such recognition would coincide with a\ncommitment to a formal plan of action. No amounts have been recognized for environmental liabilities.\nSurety Bond—In accordance with state laws, we are required to post reclamation bonds to assure that reclamation work is completed. We also have a small amount of surety\nbonds that secure performance obligations. Bonds outstanding at December 31, 2023 totaled approximately $27.2 million.\nCoal Leases and Associated Royalty Commitments—We lease coal reserves under agreements that require royalties to be paid as the coal is mined and sold. Many of these\nagreements require minimum annual royalties to be paid regardless of the amount of coal mined and sold. Total royalty expenses were $35.0 million, $34.2 million, and $18.5 million for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. These agreements generally have terms running through exhaustion of all the mineable and merchantable coal\ncovered by the respective lease. Royalties or throughput payments are based on a percentage of the gross selling price received for the coal we mine. Minimum royalty obligations\nunder coal leases total $27.2 million and are broken down as follows: $3.3 million for 2024, $3.3 million for 2025, $3.2 million for 2026, $3.2 million for 2027, $3.2 million for 2028, and $11.0\nmillion thereafter. Refer to Note 12 for information regarding related party transactions.\nContingent Transportation Purchase Commitments—We secure the ability to transport coal through rail contracts and export terminals that are sometimes funded through\ntake-or-pay arrangements. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s remaining commitments under take-or-pay arrangements totaled $20.2 million, most of which relates to a five-year\ncontract that was entered into during 2023 with a total remaining commitment of $20.0 million. The five-year contract, which runs from April 1, 2023 through March 31, 2028, includes\nan annual minimum commitment of $4.5 million. The level of these commitments will be reduced at a per ton rate as such rail and export terminal services are utilized against the\nrequired minimum tonnage amounts over the contract term stipulated in such rail and export terminal contracts. We recognized $0.8 million of contingent liabilities at December 31,\n2023 related to the probable shortfall associated with our annual minimum commitment.\nLitigation—From time to time, we are subject to various litigation and other claims in the normal course of business. No amounts have been accrued in the consolidated\nfinancial statements with respect to any matters.\n112\nTable of Contents\nOn November 5, 2018, one of our three raw coal storage silos that fed our Elk Creek plant experienced a partial structural failure. A temporary conveying system completed in\nlate-November 2018 restored approximately 80% of our plant capacity. We completed a permanent belt workaround and restored the preparation plant to its full processing capacity in\nmid-2019. Our insurance carrier, Federal Insurance Company, disputed our claim for coverage based on certain exclusions to the applicable policy and, therefore, on August 21, 2019,\nwe filed suit against Federal Insurance Company and Chubb INA Holdings, Inc. in Logan County Circuit Court in West Virginia seeking a declaratory judgment that the partial silo\ncollapse was an insurable event and to require coverage under our policy. Defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia,\nand upon removal, we substituted ACE American Insurance Company as a defendant in place of Chubb INA Holdings, Inc. The trial in the matter commenced on June 29, 2021, in\nCharleston, West Virginia.\nOn July 15, 2021, the jury returned a verdict in our favor for $7.7 million in contract damages and on July 16, 2021, made an additional award of $25.0 million for damages for\nwrongful denial of the claim under Hayseeds, Inc. v. State Farm Fire & Cas., 177 W. Va. 323, 352 S.E. 2d 73 (W. Va. 1986), including inconvenience and aggravation. On August 12,\n2021, the defendants filed a post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law or in the alternative to alter or amend the judgment or for a new trial. On March 4, 2022, the court entered\nits memorandum opinion and order on the motion reducing the jury award to a total of $1.8 million, including pre-judgment interest, and also vacated and set aside, in its entirety, the\njury award of Hayseeds damages. The same day, the court entered the judgment in accordance with the memorandum opinion and order.\nOn April 1, 2022, we filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. On July 20, 2023, the court rendered a decision reinstating the jury’s $7.7\nmillion contract damages verdict. The court further determined that we are entitled to attorney’s fees in an amount to be determined on remand. Finally, the court held that we are\nentitled to Hayseeds damages for wrongful denial of the claim but remanded for a new trial on the amount of such damages after affirming that the original $25 million award was\nexcessive. On August 3, 2023, the Defendants-Appellees filed a Petition of Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc with the Fourth Circuit. The petition was denied by order dated August\n15, 2023. On August 29, 2023, the court clarified that the amount of attorney’s fees to be determined on remand included appellate fees. On September 8, 2023, the court entered its\namended judgment, which awarded post-judgment interest on the previously awarded and reinstated verdict related to contract (compensatory) damages and the Fourth Circuit\nthereafter issued its mandate on October 2, 2023. The matter is now pending before the District Court for a new trial on damages for inconvenience and aggravation as well as the\ncourt’s determination and award of attorney’s fees.\nThe defendants fully paid the portion of the judgment related to contract (compensatory) damages in the court’s order and that portion of the matter is considered closed.\nThe Company recognized a $7.8 million gain during 2023, which was recorded in Other income (expense), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of this amount, $2.0\nmillion was included in Insurance proceeds related to property, plant, and equipment as part of investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the remaining\namount was included in operating activities.\nNOTE 11—REVENUES\nOur revenue is derived from contracts for the sale of coal and is recognized when the performance obligations under the contracts are satisfied, which is at the point in time\ncontrol is transferred to our customer. Generally, domestic sales contracts have terms of about one year and the pricing is typically fixed. Export sales have spot or term contracts, and\npricing can be either a fixed price or a price derived against index-based pricing mechanisms. Sales completed with\n113\nTable of Contents\ndelivery to an export terminal are reported as export revenue. Disaggregated information about our revenue is presented below:\nYear ended December 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nCoal Sales\nNorth American revenue $ 227,484 $ 328,322 $ 143,946\nExport revenue, excluding Canada 466,040 237,366 139,448\nTotal revenue $ 693,524 $ 565,688 $ 283,394\nFourth quarter 2023 revenue that can be derived from the Company’s periodic filings includes a $1.3 million upward adjustment to revenue related to performance obligations\nthat were satisfied in the previous quarter. Fourth quarter 2022 revenue that can be derived from the Company’s periodic filings includes a $2.8 million downward adjustment to\nrevenue related to performance obligations that were satisfied in the previous quarter. These adjustments were due to true-ups of previous estimates for provisional pricing\nprovisions.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding performance obligations of approximately 1.4 million tons for contracts with fixed sales prices averaging $166 per ton\nand 2.1 million additional tons for contracts with index-based pricing mechanisms. The Company expects to satisfy approximately 88% of the committed tons in 2024 and the\nremainder in 2025. Variable amounts, including index-based prices, have not been estimated for the purpose of disclosing remaining performance obligations as permitted under the\nrevenue recognition guidance when variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation.\nSales into individual foreign countries equaling or exceeding 10% of our total revenues included Germany and Canada, each of which represented 14% of 2023 revenues, as\nwell as Brazil, which represented 10% of 2023 revenues. Sales into Canada and South Africa were 12% and 10%, respectively, of 2022 revenues. The Company used the final export\ndestination of the goods as the basis for these disclosures.\nNOTE 12—RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nMineral Lease and Surface Rights Agreements—Prior to the acquisition of Ramaco Coal, as discussed in Note 4, much of the coal reserves and surface rights that we\ncontrolled were acquired through a series of mineral leases and surface rights agreements with Ramaco Coal, who was a related party.

Cash paid for income taxes totaled $0.8 million for 2023 before consideration of refunds received. The Company received a refund of $11.8 million during\n2023, which drove the decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the balance sheet compared to December 31, 2022.\nNOTE 14—EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\nEarnings per share (\"EPS”) is not presented retrospectively for periods prior to the issuance of the tracking stock as the tracking stock was not a part of the Company’s\ncapital structure during those periods and the issuance of the tracking stock changes the common shareholders’ relative residual interest in the Company. Therefore, EPS is presented\nfor the Company’s single class of common stock up to the time the tracking stock was issued. EPS is presented prospectively under the two-class method starting on the date of\ninitial distribution of the tracking stock. Refer to Note 9 for information related to the Company’s tracking stock.\nThe computation of basic and diluted EPS is shown on the following page:\n116\nTable of Contents\n(In thousands, except per share amounts) Years ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nEarnings attribution\nSingle class of common stock (through 6/20/2023) * $ 31,382 $ 116,042 $ 39,759\nClass A common stock (6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023) 44,663 — —\nClass A restricted stock awards (6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023) 1,897 — —\nClass B common stock (6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023) 3,498 — —\nClass B restricted stock awards (6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023) 144 — —\nForfeitable dividends declared on unvested stock-based awards 729 — —\nNet income $ 82,313 $ 116,042 $ 39,759\n* Common stock and restricted stock participated in earnings 1:1 and are shown on a\ncombined basis through 6/20/2023 consistent with historical presentation\nJan. 1 - June 20, Years ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nEPS data for single class of common stock through 6/20/2023\nNumerator\nNet earnings $ 31,382 $ 116,042 $ 39,759\nDenominator\nWeighted average shares used to compute basic earnings per share * 44,344 44,164 43,964\nDilutive effect of stock option awards 381 532 293\nDilutive effect of restricted stock units — 6 —\nDilutive effect of performance stock units 27 — —\nWeighted average shares used to compute diluted earnings per share 44,752 44,702 44,257\nEarnings per common share (single class of common stock)\nBasic $ 0.71 $ 2.63 $ 0.90\nDiluted $ 0.70 $ 2.60 $ 0.90\nJune 21, 2023 - December 31, 2023\nClass A Class B\nEPS data for dual-class common stock 6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023\nNumerator\nNet earnings $ 44,663 $ 3,498\nDenominator\nWeighted average shares used to compute basic earnings per share ** 42,115 8,428\nDilutive effect of stock option awards 482 111\nDilutive effect of restricted stock units 157 48\nDilutive effect of performance stock units 436 111\nWeighted average shares used to compute diluted earnings per share 43,190 8,698\nEarnings per common share (dual-class structure)\nBasic $ 1.06 $ 0.42\nDiluted $ 1.03 $ 0.40\n** Does not include unvested restricted stock, which averaged 1.8 million and 0.4 million for\nClass A and Class B, respectively, for the period June 21, 2023 through December 31, 2023\n117\nTable of Contents\nUnvested restricted stock awards have the right to receive nonforfeitable dividends on the same basis as common shares; therefore, unvested restricted stock is considered\na participating security for the purpose of calculating EPS. Historically, the Company has shown EPS for its common stock and unvested restricted stock on a combined basis since\nboth instruments participate in net earnings on the same basis and the resulting EPS is typically the same. Starting under the two-class method, the Company reports separately the\nnet earnings allocated away from holders of Class A and Class B common stock to holders of unvested restricted stock awards.\nUnvested restricted stock units and performance stock units include forfeitable dividend rights that are subject to the vesting conditions of the underlying awards;\ntherefore, these awards are not considered participating securities and should not be allocated undistributed earnings for the purpose of calculating EPS. However, dividends or\ndividend equivalents declared and charged to retained earnings for these awards reduce the amount of net earnings available for distribution to common stockholders and should be\nreflected as such under the two-class method.\nFor accounting purposes, Class B’s participation rights are, in substance, discretionary based on the power of the Company’s Board of Directors to add or modify expense\nallocation policies, redefine CORE assets, and redetermine CORE’s per-ton usage fees at any time, in its sole discretion, without shareholder approval. Therefore, no amount of the\nCompany’s net earnings shall be allocated to Class B for the purpose of calculating EPS other than actual dividends declared during the period for the tracking stock. Refer to Note 9\nfor information regarding dividends declared on Class B common stock.\nDiluted EPS was calculated using the treasury stock method for stock options and restricted stock units. For performance stock units, the awards were first evaluated under\nthe contingently issuable shares guidance, which requires a determination as to whether shares would be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency\nperiod. For shares determined to be issuable under performance stock unit awards, the treasury stock method was then applied to determine the dilutive impact of the awards, if any.\nUnvested restricted stock awards are considered potential common shares as well as participating securities, as discussed previously, and were included in diluted EPS using the\nmore dilutive of the treasury stock method or the two-class method. Since these awards share in dividends on a 1:1 basis with common shares, applying the treasury stock method\nwould be antidilutive compared to the basic EPS calculation that allocates earnings to participating securities under the two-class method discussed previously.\nDiluted EPS for the period from January 1, 2023 through June 20, 2023, the period for which a single class of common stock existed, excluded all outstanding restricted stock\nunits, or 684,151 units in total, because the effect would have been antidilutive under the treasury stock method. In addition, diluted EPS for the same period excluded outstanding\nperformance stock units originally granted in 2022, or 248,706 units at target, based on the guidance for contingently issuable shares, which requires exclusion when shares would not\nbe issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period.\nFor the period from June 21,2023 through December 31, 2023, the Company’s ability to convert Class B common shares into Class A common shares, as discussed previously\nin Note 9, is a contingency that will not be reflected in the diluted EPS for Class A under the if-converted method until such time that the required Board resolutions occur, if ever.\nDiluted EPS for 2022 excluded 248,706 of target performance stock units based on the guidance for contingently issuable shares discussed earlier.\nNOTE 15—SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn February 1, 2024, the Company announced that the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.2416 per share of Class B common stock, which will be payable on\nMarch 15, 2024 to shareholders of record on March 1, 2024.\nIn February 2024, the Company completed the purchase of an existing coal preparation plant, which will be relocated to the Company’s Maben Complex. The purchase price\nof the plant is $3 million. The Company anticipates\n118\nTable of Contents\nspending an additional $8 million in initial development capital expenditures related to the plant in 2024. These costs would include amounts related to the relocation, reassembly, and\nexpansion of the facility at Maben.\n* * * * *\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nManagement’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of December 31, 2023, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to applicable Exchange Act rules. Based on\nthis evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023 were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as a\nresult of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting disclosed below. The Company’s remediation plan for the material weakness in internal control over financial\nreporting is also discussed below.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Management used the criteria described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (\"COSO”) to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. Based on this evaluation,\nmanagement identified a material weakness related to a pervasive lack of sufficient documentation of accounting policies, procedures, and controls. This lack of sufficient\ndocumentation does not allow management to effectively assess its relevant risks and key controls to properly test for design and operating effectiveness. A material weakness is a\ncontrol deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or\ninterim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by Cherry Bekaert, an independent registered public accounting\nfirm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.\nRemediation Plan. We are currently developing a plan of remediation to address this material weakness, which will include assessing, redesigning, and implementing\nmodifications of our internal controls. We will not be able to fully remediate this material weakness until these steps have been completed and subsequent validation and testing of\nthese internal controls have demonstrated their operating effectiveness over a sustained period of financial reporting cycles. Once the remediation plan is fully developed, we will be\nimplementing process, control, and documentation improvements to address the above material weakness that include, but are not limited to, designing and implementing specific\nmanagement review procedures to ensure completeness and accuracy of key financial and non-financial data utilized in our business; and implementing improved policies,\nprocedures, and control activities over key financial data to ensure accuracy and completeness of this data as used in the aforementioned management review procedures.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Except for the material weakness and remediation actions described above, there were no significant changes in our\ninternal control over financial reporting during our fourth quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n119\nTable of Contents\nItem 9B. Other Information\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, none of the Company’s directors or executive officers adopted, modified, or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule\n10b5-1 trading arrangement (each as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), except as follows:\nOn December 12, 2023, Jason Fannin, the Company’s chief commercial officer, adopted a trading plan intended to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c).

(the \"Company” or \"Ramaco”) has Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \"Class A common stock”) and Class B common\nstock, par value $0.01 per share (the \"Class B common stock” and collectively with the Class A common stock, the \"common stock”) registered under Section 12 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The following contains a description of our common stock, as well as certain related additional information. This description is a\nsummary only and does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified by reference to the provisions of applicable law, the Company’s Amended and Restated\nCertificate of Incorporation, as amended (the \"Certificate”), and the Company’s Amended and Restated Bylaws (the \"Bylaws,” and together with the Certificate, the \"Charter\nDocuments”), each of which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information, please read the Company’s\nCharter Documents and the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL”). References to \"we,” \"our” and \"us” refer to the Company, unless\nthe context otherwise requires. References to \"stockholders” refer to holders of our common stock, unless the context otherwise requires.\nGeneral\nPursuant to the Certificate, we are authorized to issue 310,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of 225,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, 35,000,000 shares\nof Class B common stock, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \"preferred stock”). There are no issued and outstanding shares of preferred\nstock.\nDescription of Common Stock\nVoting Rights\nHolders of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to one vote per share held of record on all matters to be voted upon by the\nstockholders. The holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors.\nDividend Rights\nHolders of shares of our Class A common stock are entitled to ratably receive dividends when and if declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available\nfor that purpose, subject to any statutory or contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and to any prior rights and preferences that may be applicable to any\noutstanding preferred stock.\nHolders of shares of our Class B common stock are entitled to ratably receive a quarterly dividend tied to the financial performance of the CORE Assets, subject to the\ndiscretion of our board of directors, the requirements of applicable law, any statutory or contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and to any prior rights and\npreferences that may be applicable to any outstanding preferred stock. The timing and amount of dividends declared in future periods will depend on, among other things, (a)\nour earnings, earnings outlook, production, processing and shipping levels, financial condition, cash flow, cash requirements and our outlook on current and future market\nconditions, (b) our overall liquidity, (c) the restrictive covenants in the Credit Agreement and any future debt instruments that we may enter into and (d) provisions of\napplicable law governing the dividends.\nAny determination to declare a regular or special dividend, as well as the amount of any dividend that may be declared, will be based on the board of director’s\nconsideration of our financial position, earnings, earnings outlook, capital spending plans, outlook on current and future market conditions, alternative stockholder return\nmethods such as share repurchases, and other factors that the board of directors considers relevant at that time.\nLiquidation Rights\nUpon our liquidation, dissolution, distribution of assets or other winding up, the holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably the assets available for\ndistribution to the stockholders after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preference of any of our outstanding shares of preferred stock. Holders of shares of our Class B\ncommon stock will not have any specific rights with respect to the CORE Assets.\nOther Matters\nThe shares of Class A common stock have no preemptive or conversion rights and are not subject to further calls or assessment by us. There are no redemption or\nsinking fund provisions applicable to the Class A common stock. Our board of directors is permitted, in its sole discretion, to exchange all of the outstanding shares of Class B\ncommon stock into shares of Class A common stock based on an exchange ratio determined by obtained by dividing (I) the average market value of the Class B common stock\nover the 20-day trading period ending on the trading day preceding the date designated by the board of directors for the determination of the exchange ratio (the\n\"Determination Date”), by (II) the average market value of the Class A common stock over the 20-day trading period ending on the trading day preceding the Determination\nDate. All outstanding shares of our common stock are fully paid and non-assessable.\nListing\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \"METC.”\nAnti-Takeover Effects of Provisions of Our Certificate, Bylaws and Delaware Law\nSome provisions of Delaware law, and our Charter Documents described below, contain provisions that could make the following transactions more difficult:\nacquisitions of us by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise; or removal of our incumbent officers and directors. These provisions may also have the effect of\npreventing changes in our management. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish or could deter transactions that stockholders may\notherwise consider to be in their best interest or in our best interests, including transactions that might result in a premium over the market price for our shares.\nThese provisions, summarized below, are expected to discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to\nencourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with us. We believe that the benefits of increased protection and our potential ability to negotiate with the\nproponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging these proposals because, among other things,\nnegotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of their terms.\nDelaware Law\nWe will not be subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, regulating corporate takeovers for so long as Yorktown Energy Partners IX, L.P., Yorktown\nEnergy Partners X, L.P and Yorktown Energy Partners XI, L.P. (collectively, \"Yorktown”) and Energy Capital Partners Mezzanine Opportunities Fund, L.P., Energy Capital\nPartners Mezzanine Opportunities Fund A, LP and ECP Mezzanine B (Ramaco IP), LP (collectively, \"ECP”) and their respective affiliates own in the aggregate more than 15% of\nour outstanding common stock. In general, those provisions prohibit a Delaware corporation, including those whose securities are listed for trading on the NASDAQ, from\nengaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder,\nunless:\n● the transaction is approved by the board of directors before the date the interested stockholder attained that status;\n● upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of\nthe voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced; or\n2\n● on or after such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at a meeting of stockholders by at least two-thirds of the\noutstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.\nAmended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws\nProvisions of our Charter Documents may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control or change in our management, including\ntransactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests.\nTherefore, these provisions could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nAmong other things, the Charter Documents:\n● establish advance notice procedures with regard to stockholder proposals relating to the nomination of candidates for election as directors or new business\nto be brought before meetings of our stockholders. These procedures provide that notice of stockholder proposals must be timely given in writing to our\ncorporate secretary prior to the meeting at which the action is to be taken. Generally, to be timely, notice must be received at our principal executive offices\nnot less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the annual meeting for the preceding year. The Bylaws specify the\nrequirements as to form and content of all stockholders’ notices. These requirements may preclude stockholders from bringing matters before the\nstockholders at an annual or special meeting;\n● provide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law or, if applicable, the rights of holders of a series of\npreferred stock, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n● provide our board of directors the ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock. This ability makes it possible for our board of directors to issue, without\nstockholder approval, preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of us. These\nand other provisions may have the effect of deferring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management of the Company;\n● provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors;\n● provide that any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and\nmay not be effected by any consent in writing in lieu of a meeting of such stockholders, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock with\nrespect to such series;\n● provide that our Charter Documents may be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of our then outstanding common stock;\n● provide that special meetings of our stockholders may only be called by the board of directors;\n● provide for our board of directors to be divided into three classes of directors, with each class as nearly equal in number as possible, serving staggered three-\nyear terms, other than directors which may be elected by holders of preferred stock, if any. This system of electing and removing directors may tend to\ndiscourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, because it generally makes it more difficult for stockholders\nto replace a majority of the directors;\n● provide that we renounce any interest in existing and future investments in other entities by, or the business opportunities of, Yorktown or ECP or any of their\nofficers, directors, agents, stockholders, members, partners, affiliates and subsidiaries (other than our directors that are presented business opportunities in\ntheir capacity as our directors) and that they have no obligation to offer us those investments or opportunities; and\n● provide that the Bylaws can be amended by the board of directors.\nForum Selection\n3\nOur Certificate provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent\npermitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n● any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n● any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders;\n● any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or other employee of ours arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our Certificate or\nour Bylaws; or\n● any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or other employee of ours that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case\nsubject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein.\nOur Certificate also provides that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and\nto have consented to, this forum selection provision. Although we believe these provisions will benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware\nlaw for the specified types of actions and proceedings, the provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors, officers, employees and agents. The\nenforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies’ certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in\nconnection with one or more actions or proceedings described above, a court could rule that this provision in our Certificate is inapplicable or unenforceable. This exclusive\nforum provision does not apply to a cause of action brought under federal or state securities laws.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our common stock was American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC. Effective February 10, 2023, the transfer agent and\nregistrar for our common stock is Computershare, Inc.\nDescription of Notes\nSet forth below is a summary description of the material terms and provisions of our 9.00% Senior Notes due 2026 (the \"Notes”), which does not purport to be complete.

The indenture does not contain any financial covenants and does not restrict\nus from paying dividends or issuing or repurchasing our other securities. Other than restrictions described under \"—Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”\nbelow, the indenture does not contain any covenants or other provisions designed to afford holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction\ninvolving us or in the event of a decline in our credit rating as the result of a takeover, recapitalization, highly leveraged transaction or similar restructuring involving us that\ncould adversely affect such holders.\nWe may from time to time, without the consent of the existing holders, issue additional Notes having the same terms as to status, redemption or otherwise (except the price to\npublic, the issue date and, if applicable, the initial interest accrual date and the initial interest payment date) that may constitute a single fungible series with the Notes offered\nby this prospectus; provided that if any such additional Notes are not fungible with the Notes initially offered hereby for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such additional\nNotes will have one or more separate CUSIP numbers. For the avoidance of doubt, such additional Notes will still constitute a single series with all other Notes issued under\nthe indenture for all purposes, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase.\nRanking\nThe Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, and, upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, will rank (i) senior to the outstanding shares of our common\nstock, (ii) senior to any of our future subordinated debt, (iii) pari passu (or equally) with our future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, (iv) effectively subordinated\nto any existing or future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which we subsequently grant security), to the extent of the value of the\nassets securing such indebtedness, and (v) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities. See\n\"Risk Factors—The Notes will be unsecured and therefore will be effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness that we currently have or that we may incur in the\nfuture.”\nThe Notes will be obligations solely of the Company and will not be guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries. We derive substantially all of our operating income and cash flow\nfrom our investments in our subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such subsidiaries over\nthe claims of our creditors, including holders of the Notes. As a result, the Notes will be effectively subordinated to creditors, including trade creditors and preferred\nstockholders, if any, other than us, of our subsidiaries. See \"Risk Factors—The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our\nsubsidiaries.”\nAs of May 31, 2021, we had approximately $21.3 million of outstanding indebtedness (excluding the PPP Loan (as defined in this prospectus)), all of which was secured.\nInterest\n5\nInterest on the Notes will accrue at an annual rate equal to 9.00% from and including July 13, 2021 to, but excluding, the maturity date or earlier acceleration or redemption and\nwill be payable quarterly in arrears on January 30, April 30, July 30 and October 30 of each year, beginning on July 30, 2021 and at maturity, to the holders of record at the close\nof business on the immediately preceding January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 (and July 15 immediately preceding the maturity date), as applicable (whether or not a\nbusiness day).\nThe initial interest period for the Notes was the period from and including July 13, 2021, to, but excluding, July 30, 2021, and subsequent interest periods will be the periods\nfrom and including an interest payment date to, but excluding, the next interest payment date or the stated maturity date, as the case may be. The amount of interest payable for\nany interest period, including interest payable for any partial interest period, will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. If an interest\npayment date falls on a non-business day, the applicable interest payment will be made on the next business day and no additional interest will accrue as a result of such\ndelayed payment.\n\"Business day” means, for any place where the principal and interest on the Notes is payable, each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday which is not a day in\nwhich banking institutions in New York or Wilmington, Delaware are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.\nOptional Redemption\nExcept as described below and under \"—Optional Redemption Upon Change of Control,” the Notes were not redeemable by us at our option prior to July 30, 2023.\nThe Notes may be redeemed for cash in whole or in part at any time at our option on or after July 30, 2023 and prior to maturity, at a price equal to 100% of their principal\namount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. In each case, redemption shall be upon notice not fewer than 10 days and not more than 60\ndays prior to the date fixed for redemption, except that redemption notices may be delivered more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection\nwith a defeasance of the Notes or a discharge of the indenture. Notices of redemption may be subject to satisfaction or waiver of one or more conditions precedent specified in\nthe notice of redemption.\nIf less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed, the particular Notes to be redeemed will be selected not more than 45 days prior to the redemption date by the trustee from the\noutstanding Notes not previously called for redemption, by lot, or in the trustee’s discretion, on a pro-rata basis, provided that the unredeemed portion of the principal amount\nof any Notes will be in an authorized denomination (which will not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Notes. The trustee will promptly notify us in\nwriting of the Notes selected for redemption and, in the case of any Notes selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. Beneficial interests in\nany of the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption that are registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be selected by DTC in accordance with DTC’s applicable\nprocedures.\nThe trustee shall have no obligation to calculate any redemption price or any component thereof, and the trustee shall be entitled to receive and conclusively rely upon an\nofficer’s certificate delivered by the Company that specifies any redemption price.\nUnless we default on the payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes called for redemption.\nWe may at any time, and from time to time, purchase Notes at any price or prices in the open market or otherwise.\nOptional Redemption Upon Change of Control\nThe Notes may be redeemed for cash in whole but not in part at our option at any time within 90 days of the occurrence of a Change of Control, at a price equal to 100% of their\nprincipal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Redemption shall be upon notice not fewer than 10 days and not\n6\nmore than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption. Notices of redemption may be subject to satisfaction or waiver of one or more conditions precedent specified in the\nnotice of redemption.\nA \"Change of Control” will be deemed to have occurred at the time after the Notes are originally issued if:\n(1) any \"Person” (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes the \"Beneficial Owner” (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under\nthe Exchange Act, except that for purposes of this clause (1) such Person shall be deemed to have \"Beneficial Ownership” of all shares that any such Person has the right to\nacquire, whether such right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time), directly or indirectly, of more than 50.0% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock\nof the Company;\n(2) the merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person or the merger of another Person with or into the Company, or the sale of all or substantially all\nthe assets of the Company (determined on a consolidated basis) to another Person other than a transaction following which, in the case of a merger or consolidation\ntransaction, holders of securities that represented 100.0% of the Voting Stock of the Company immediately prior to such transaction (or other securities into which such\nsecurities are converted as part of such merger or consolidation transaction) own directly or indirectly at least a majority of the voting power of the Voting Stock of the\nsurviving Person in such merger or consolidation transaction immediately after such transaction and in substantially the same proportion as before the transaction;\n(3) \"Continuing Directors” (as defined below) cease to constitute at least a majority of the Company’s board of directors; or\n(4) if after the Notes are initially listed on the NYSE or another national securities exchange, the Notes fail, or at any point cease, to be listed on the NYSE or such other\nnational securities exchange. For the avoidance of doubt, it shall not be a Change of Control if after the Notes are initially listed on the NYSE or another national securities\nexchange, such Notes are subsequently listed on a different national securities exchange and the prior listing is terminated.\n\"Continuing Director” means a director who either was a member of our board of directors on the issue date of the Notes or who becomes a member of our board of directors\nsubsequent to that date and whose election, appointment or nomination for election by our stockholders is duly approved by a majority of the continuing directors on our\nboard of directors at the time of such approval by such election or appointment.\n\"Voting Stock” of any specified Person as of any date means the Capital Stock of such Person that is at the time entitled to vote generally in the election of the Board of\nDirectors of such Person.\nEvents of Default\nHolders of our Notes will have rights if an Event of Default occurs in respect of the Notes and is not cured, as described later in this subsection. The term \"Event of Default” in\nrespect of the Notes means any of the following:\n● we do not pay interest on any Note when due, and such default is not cured within 30 days;\n● we do not pay the principal of the Notes when due and payable;\n● we breach any covenant or warranty in the indenture with respect to the Notes and such breach continues for 60 days after we receive a written notice of\nsuch breach from the trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the principal amount of the Notes; and\n● certain specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occur and remain undischarged or unstayed for a period of 90 days.\nThe trustee may withhold notice to the holders of the Notes of any default, except in the payment of principal or interest, if the trustee in good faith determines the withholding\nof notice to be in the interest of the holders of the Notes.\n7\nEach year, we will furnish to the trustee a written statement of certain of our officers certifying that to their knowledge we are in compliance with the indenture and the Notes,\nor else specifying any default, its status and what actions we are taking or propose to take with respect thereto.\nRemedies if an Event of Default Occurs\nIf an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes may declare the entire\nprincipal amount of the Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to be due and payable immediately by a notice in writing to us and, if notice is given by the\nholders of the Notes, the trustee. This is called an \"acceleration of maturity.” If the Event of Default occurs in relation to our filing for bankruptcy or certain other events of\nbankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization occur, the principal amount of the Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will automatically, and without any\ndeclaration or other action on the part of the trustee or the holders, become immediately due and payable.\nAt any time after a declaration of acceleration of the Notes has been made by the trustee or the holders of the Notes and before any judgment or decree for payment of money\ndue has been obtained by the trustee, the holders of a majority of the outstanding principal of the Notes, by written notice to us and the trustee, may rescind and annul such\ndeclaration and its consequences if (i) we have paid or deposited with the trustee all amounts due and owed with respect to the Notes (other than principal that has become\ndue solely by reason of such acceleration) and certain other amounts, and (ii) any other Events of Default have been cured or waived.\nAt our election, the sole remedy with respect to an Event of Default due to our failure to comply with certain reporting requirements under the Trust Indenture Act or under \"—\nCovenants—Reporting” below, for the first 180 calendar days after the occurrence of such Event of Default, consists exclusively of the right to receive additional interest on\nthe Notes at an annual rate equal to (1) 0.25% for the first 90 calendar days after such default and (2) 0.50% for calendar days 91 through 180 after such default. On the 181st\nday after such Event of Default, if such violation is not cured or waived, the trustee or the holders of not less than 25% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes may\ndeclare the principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes to be due and payable immediately. If we choose to pay such additional interest, we must\nnotify the trustee and the holders of the Notes by certificate of our election at any time on or before the close of business on the first business day following the Event of\nDefault and we shall deliver to the trustee an officer’s certificate (upon which the trustee may rely conclusively) to that effect stating (i) the amount of such additional interest\nthat is payable and (ii) the date on which such additional interest is payable. Unless and until the trustee receives such a certificate, the trustee may assume without inquiry\nthat no such additional interest is payable and the trustee shall not have any duty to verify our calculations of additional interest.\nBefore a holder of the Notes is allowed to bypass the trustee and bring a lawsuit or other formal legal action or take other steps to enforce such holder’s rights relating to the\nNotes, the following must occur:\n● such holder must give the trustee written notice that the Event of Default has occurred and remains uncured;\n● the holders of at least 25% of the outstanding principal of the Notes must have made a written request to the trustee to institute proceedings in respect of\nsuch Event of Default in its own name as trustee;\n● such holder or holders must have offered to the trustee indemnity satisfactory to the trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in\ncompliance with such request;\n● the trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and\n● no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to the trustee during such 60-day period by holders of a majority of the outstanding\nprincipal of the Notes.\nNo delay or omission in exercising any right or remedy will be treated as a waiver of that right, remedy or Event of Default.\n8\nThe holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may waive any default or Event of Default and its consequences, except defaults or Events of Default\nregarding payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, unless we have cured the default or Event of Default in accordance with the indenture. Any waiver shall cure the\ndefault or Event of Default.\nSubject to the terms of the indenture, if an Event of Default occurs and continues, the trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the indenture\nat the request or direction of any of the holders, unless such holders have offered the trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the trustee. The holders of a majority in\nprincipal amount of the outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee, or\nexercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee, with respect to the Notes, provided that:\n● the direction so given by the holder is not in conflict with any law or the indenture, nor does it subject the trustee to a risk of personal liability in respect of\nwhich the trustee has not received indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not\ntaking such action; and\n● the trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.\nA holder of the Notes will have the right to institute a proceeding under the indenture or to appoint a receiver or trustee, or to seek other remedies only if:\n● the holder has given written notice to the trustee of a continuing Event of Default;\n● the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Notes have made written request to the trustee to institute proceedings in\nrespect of such Event of Default in its own name as trustee under the indenture, and such holders have offered security or indemnity satisfactory to the\ntrustee to institute the proceeding as trustee; and\n● the trustee does not institute the proceeding, and does not receive from the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes\nother conflicting directions within 60 days after the notice, request and offer.\nThese limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by a holder if we default in the payment of the principal, premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes.\nBook-entry and other indirect holders of the Notes should consult their banks or brokers for information on how to give notice or direction to or make a request of the\ntrustee and how to declare or cancel an acceleration of maturity.\nWaiver of Defaults\nThe holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes may on behalf of the holders of all Notes waive any past default with respect to the\nNotes other than (i) a default in the payment of principal or interest on the Notes when such payments are due and payable (other than by acceleration as described above), or\n(ii) in respect of a covenant that cannot per the terms of the indenture be modified or amended without the consent of each holder of Notes.\nCovenants\nIn addition to standard covenants relating to payment of principal and interest, maintaining an office where payments may be made or securities can be surrendered for\npayment, payment of taxes by us and related matters, the following covenants will apply to the Notes.\nMerger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets\n9\nThe indenture provides that we will not merge or consolidate with or into any other person (other than a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary into us), or sell, transfer, lease,\nconvey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all our property in any one transaction or series of related transactions unless:\n● we are the surviving entity or the entity (if other than us) formed by such merger or consolidation or to which such sale, transfer, lease, conveyance or\ndisposition is made will be a corporation or limited liability company organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof\nor the District of Columbia;\n● the surviving entity (if other than us) expressly assumes, by supplemental indenture in form reasonably satisfactory to the trustee, executed and delivered to\nthe trustee by such surviving entity, the due and punctual payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, all the Notes outstanding, and\nthe due and punctual performance and observance of all the covenants and conditions of the indenture to be performed by us;\n● immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of related transactions, no default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; and\n● in the case of a merger where the surviving entity is other than us, we or such surviving entity will deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the trustee, an\nofficers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that such transaction and the supplemental indenture, if any, in respect thereto, comply with this\ncovenant and that all conditions precedent in the indenture relating to such transaction have been complied with; provided that in giving an opinion of\ncounsel, counsel may rely on an officers’ certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to the satisfaction of the preceding bullet.\nThe surviving entity (if other than us) will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under the Notes and the indenture, and\nthe Company will automatically and unconditionally be released and discharged from its obligations under the Notes and the indenture.\nReporting\nIf, at any time, we are not subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act to file any periodic reports with the SEC, we agree to furnish to\nholders of the Notes and the trustee, for the period of time during which the Notes are outstanding, our audited annual consolidated financial statements, within 90 days of our\nfiscal year end, and unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, within 45 days of our fiscal quarter end (other than our fourth fiscal quarter). All such financial\nstatements will be prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with GAAP, as applicable.\nThe posting or delivery of any such information, documents and reports to the trustee is for informational purposes only and the trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute\nconstructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Company’s compliance with any of the covenants\nunder the indenture (as to which the trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on an officer’s certificate). The trustee shall have no duty to review or analyze reports, information\nand documents delivered to it. Additionally, the trustee shall not be obligated to monitor or confirm, on a continuing basis or otherwise, the Company’s compliance with the\ncovenants or with respect to any reports or other documents filed with any protected online data system or participate on any conference calls.\nModification or Waiver\nThere are three types of changes we can make to the indenture and the Notes:\nChanges Not Requiring Approval\nWe can make certain changes to the indenture and the Notes without the specific approval of the holders of the Notes. This type is limited to clarifications and certain other\nchanges that would not adversely affect holders of the Notes in any material respect and include changes:\n10\n● to evidence the succession of another corporation, and the assumption by the successor corporation of our covenants, agreements and obligations under\nthe indenture and the Notes;\n● to add to our covenants such new covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions for the protection of the holders of the Notes;\n● to make the occurrence, or the occurrence and continuance, of a default in any of such additional covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions an Event\nof Default;\n● to modify, eliminate or add to any of the provisions of the indenture to such extent as necessary to effect the qualification of the indenture under the Trust\nIndenture Act, and to add to the indenture such other provisions as may be expressly permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, excluding however, the\nprovisions referred to in Section 316(a)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act;\n● to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision contained in the indenture or in any supplemental indenture which may be defective or\ninconsistent with other provisions;\n● to secure the Notes;\n● to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment of a successor trustee and to add or change any provisions of the indenture as necessary to\nprovide for or facilitate the administration of the trust by more than one trustee;\n● to establish the form or terms of Securities; and\n● to make provisions in regard to matters or questions arising under the indenture, so long as such other provisions do not materially affect the interest of any\nother holder of the Notes.\nChanges Requiring Approval of Each Holder\nWe cannot make certain changes to the Notes without the specific approval of each holder of the Notes. The following is a list of those types of changes:\n● changing the stated maturity of the principal of, or any installment of interest on, any Note;\n● reducing the principal amount or rate of interest of any Note;\n● changing the place of payment where any Note or any interest is payable;\n● impairing the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or after the date on which it is due and payable;\n● reducing the percentage in principal amount of holders of the Notes whose consent is needed to modify or amend the indenture; and\n● reducing the percentage in principal amount of holders of the Notes whose consent is needed to waive compliance with certain provisions of the indenture\nor to waive certain defaults.\nChanges Requiring Majority Approval\nAny other change to the indenture and the Notes would require the approval by holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes.\nConsent from holders to any change to the indenture or the Notes must be given in writing. The consent of the holders of the Notes is not necessary under the indenture to\napprove the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.\nFurther Details Concerning Voting\nThe amount of Notes deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of voting will include all Notes authenticated and delivered under the indenture as of the date of determination\nexcept:\n● Notes cancelled by the trustee or delivered to the trustee for cancellation;\n● Notes for which we have deposited with the trustee or paying agent or set aside in trust money for their payment or redemption and, if money has been set\naside for the redemption of the Notes, notice of such redemption has been duly given pursuant to the indenture to the satisfaction of the trustee;\n11\n● Notes held by the Company, its subsidiaries or any other entity which is an obligor under the Notes, unless such Notes have been pledged in good faith and\nthe pledgee is not the Company, an affiliate of the Company or an obligor under the Notes;\n● Notes which have undergone full defeasance, as described below; and\n● Notes which have been paid or exchanged for other Notes due to such Notes loss, destruction or mutilation, with the exception of any such Notes held by\nbona fide purchasers who have presented proof to the trustee that such Notes are valid obligations of the Company.\nWe will generally be entitled to set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the holders of the Notes that are entitled to vote or take other action under the\nindenture, and the trustee will generally be entitled to set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the holders of the Notes that are entitled to join in the giving\nor making of any Notice of Default, any declaration of acceleration of maturity of the Notes, any request to institute proceedings or the reversal of such declaration. If we or the\ntrustee set a record date for a vote or other action to be taken by the holders of the Notes, that vote or action can only be taken by persons who are holders of the Notes on\nthe record date and, unless otherwise specified, such vote or action must take place on or prior to the 180th day after the record date. We may change the record date at our\noption, and we will provide written notice to the trustee and to each holder of the Notes of any such change of record date.\nDischarge\nThe indenture will provide that we can elect to be discharged from our obligations with respect to the Notes, except for specified obligations, including obligations to:\n● register the transfer or exchange of the Notes;\n● replace stolen, lost or mutilated Notes;\n● maintain paying agencies; and\n● hold monies for payment in trust.\nIn order to exercise our rights to be discharged, we must (i) deposit with the trustee money or U.S. government obligations, or a combination thereof, sufficient (to the extent of\nany U.S. government obligations, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, investment bank or appraisal firm, to generate enough cash\nto make interest, principal and any other applicable payments on the Notes on the applicable due date) to pay all the principal of, any premium and interest on, the Notes on the\ndates payments are due, (ii) deliver irrevocable instructions to the trustee to apply the deposited cash and/or U.S. government obligations toward the payment of the Notes at\nmaturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be, and (iii) deliver an officer’s certificate and opinion of counsel to the trustee stating that all conditions precedent under\nthe indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the indenture have been complied with.\n\"U.S. government obligations” means securities that are (1) direct obligations of the United States for the payment of which its full faith and credit is pledged, or (2)\nobligations of a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United States, the payment of which is unconditionally guaranteed as a\nfull faith and credit obligation by the United States, which in either case, are not callable or redeemable by the issuer thereof and shall also include a depository receipt issued\nby a bank (as defined in Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act) as custodian with respect to any such U.S. government obligations or a specific payment of principal of or\ninterest on any such U.S. government obligations held by such custodian for the account of the holder of such depository receipt; provided that (except as required by law)\nsuch custodian is not authorized to make any deduction from the amount payable to the holder of such depository receipt from any amount received by the custodian in\nrespect of the U.S. government obligations or the specific payment of principal of or interest on the U.S. government obligations evidenced by such depository receipt.\nDefeasance\nThe following defeasance provisions will be applicable to the Notes. \"Defeasance” means that, by irrevocably depositing with the trustee an amount of cash denominated in\nU.S. dollars and/or U.S. government obligations sufficient to pay all principal and interest, if any, on the Notes when due and satisfying any additional conditions\n12\nnoted below, we will be deemed to have been discharged from our obligations under the Notes. In the event of a \"covenant defeasance,” upon depositing such funds and\nsatisfying similar conditions discussed below we would be released from certain covenants under the indenture governing the Notes. The consequences to the holders of the\nNotes would be that, while they would no longer benefit from certain covenants under the indenture, and while the Notes could not be accelerated for any reason, the holders\nof the Notes nonetheless would be guaranteed to receive the principal and interest owed to them.\nCovenant Defeasance\nUnder the indenture, we have the option to take the actions described below and be released from some of the restrictive covenants under the indenture under which the Notes\nwere issued. This is called \"covenant defeasance.” In that event, holders of the Notes would lose the protection of those restrictive covenants but would gain the protection\nof having money and government securities set aside in trust to repay the Notes. In order to achieve covenant defeasance, the following must occur:\n● we must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited with the trustee as trust funds for the benefit of all holders of the Notes cash, U.S. government\nobligations or a combination of cash and U.S. government obligations sufficient, without reinvestment, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of\nindependent public accountants, investment bank or appraisal firm, to generate enough cash to make interest, principal and any other applicable payments\non the Notes on their various due dates;\n● we must deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel stating that under U.S. federal income tax law, we may make the above deposit and covenant defeasance\nwithout causing holders to be taxed on the Notes differently than if those actions were not taken;\n● we must deliver to the trustee an officers’ certificate stating that the Notes, if then listed on any securities exchange, will not be delisted as a result of the\ndeposit;\n● no default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes has occurred and is continuing, and no defaults or Events of Defaults related to bankruptcy,\ninsolvency or organization occurs during the 90 days following the deposit;\n● the covenant defeasance must not cause the trustee to have a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act;\n● the covenant defeasance must not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, the indenture or any other material agreements or\ninstruments to which we are a party;\n● the covenant defeasance must not result in the trust arising from the deposit constituting an investment company within the meaning of the Investment\nCompany Act of 1940, as amended (the \"Investment Company Act”), unless such trust will be registered under the Investment Company Act or exempt from\nregistration thereunder; and\n● we must deliver to the trustee an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel stating that all conditions precedent with respect to the covenant defeasance\nhave been complied with.\nFull Defeasance\nIf there is a change in U.S. federal income tax law, we can legally release ourselves from all payment and other obligations on the Notes if we take the following actions below:\n● we must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited with the trustee as trust funds for the benefit of all holders of the Notes cash, U.S. government\nobligations or a combination of cash and U.S. government obligations sufficient, without reinvestment, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm, of\nindependent public accountants, investment bank or appraisal firm, to generate enough cash to make interest, principal and any other applicable payments\non the Notes on their various due dates;\n● we must deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel confirming that there has been a change to the current U.S. federal income tax law or an Internal Revenue\nService ruling that allows us to make the above deposit without causing holders to be taxed on the Notes any differently than if we did not make the deposit;\n13\n● we must deliver to the trustee an officers’ certificate stating that the Notes, if then listed on any securities exchange, will not be delisted as a result of the\ndeposit;\n● no default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes has occurred and is continuing and no defaults or Events of Defaults related to bankruptcy,\ninsolvency or organization occurs during the 90 days following the deposit;\n● the full defeasance must not cause the trustee to have a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act;\n● the full defeasance must not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, the indenture or any other material agreements or instruments to\nwhich we are a party;\n● the full defeasance must not result in the trust arising from the deposit constituting an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company\nAct unless such trust will be registered under the Investment Company Act or exempt from registration thereunder; and\n● we must deliver to the trustee an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel stating that all conditions precedent with respect to the full defeasance have\nbeen complied with.\nIn the event that the trustee is unable to apply the funds held in trust to the payment of obligations under the Notes by reason of a court order or governmental injunction or\nprohibition, then those of our obligations discharged under the full defeasance or covenant defeasance will be revived and reinstated as though no deposit of funds had\noccurred, until such time as the trustee is permitted to apply all funds held in trust under the procedure described above to the payment of obligations under the Notes.\nHowever, if we make any payment of principal or interest on the Notes to the holders, we will have the right to receive such payments from the trust in the place of the holders.\nCounsel may rely on an officers’ certificate as to any matters of fact in giving an opinion of counsel in connection with the full defeasance or covenant defeasance provisions.\nListing\nThe Notes are listed on NASDAQ under the symbol \"METCL.”\nGoverning Law\nThe indenture and the Notes will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.\nGlobal Notes; Book-Entry Issuance\nThe Notes are issued in the form of one or more global certificates, or \"Global Notes,” registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company, or \"DTC.” DTC has informed\nus that its nominee is Cede & Co. and Cede & Co. is thus the initial registered holder of the Notes. No person that acquires a beneficial interest in the Notes is entitled to\nreceive a certificate representing that person’s interest in the Notes except as described herein. Unless and until definitive securities are issued under the limited circumstances\ndescribed below, all references to actions by holders of the Notes will refer to actions taken by DTC upon instructions from its participants, and all references to payments and\nnotices to holders will refer to payments and notices to DTC or Cede & Co., as the registered holder of these securities.\nDTC has informed us that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a \"banking organization” within the meaning of the New York\nBanking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a \"clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a \"clearing agency”\nregistered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity\nissues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments from over 100 countries that DTC’s participants, or \"Direct Participants,” deposit with DTC. DTC\nalso facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-\nentry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include both\nU.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing\n14\ncorporations and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, or \"DTCC.”\nDTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is\nowned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks,\ntrust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (\"Indirect Participants”\nand, together with Direct Participants, \"Participants”). DTC has an S&P rating of AA+ and a Moody’s rating of Aaa. The DTC Rules applicable to its participants are on file\nwith the SEC. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com.\nPurchases of the Notes under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the Notes on DTC’s records. The ownership\ninterest of each actual purchaser of each Note, or the \"Beneficial Owner,” is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not\nreceive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well\nas periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership\ninterests in the Notes are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not\nreceive certificates representing their ownership interests in the Notes, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Notes is discontinued.\nTo facilitate subsequent transfers, all Notes deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co., or such other\nname as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of the Notes with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC\nnominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Notes; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the\nDirect Participants to whose accounts the Notes are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for\nkeeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.\nConveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect\nParticipants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.\nRedemption notices will be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Notes are being redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct\nParticipant in the Notes to be redeemed.\nNeither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the Notes unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s\napplicable procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to us as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s\nconsenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts the Notes are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).\nRedemption proceeds, distributions and interest payments on the Notes will be made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized\nrepresentative of DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from us or the applicable\ntrustee or depositary on the payment date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records. Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be\ngoverned by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with the Notes held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in \"street name,” and\nwill be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC nor its nominee, the applicable trustee or depositary, or us, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as\nmay be in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds, distributions and interest payments to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an\nauthorized representative of DTC) is the responsibility of us or the applicable trustee or depositary. Disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants will be the\nresponsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct Participants and Indirect Participants.\n15\nThe information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has been obtained from sources that we believe to be reliable, but we take no responsibility for\nthe accuracy thereof.\nNone of the Company, the trustee, any depositary, or any agent of any of them will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of DTC’s or any participant’s records\nrelating to, or for payments made on account of, beneficial interests in a Global Note, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial\ninterests.\nTermination of a Global Note\nIf a Global Note is terminated for any reason, interest in it will be exchanged for certificates in non-book-entry form as certificated securities. After such exchange, the choice of\nwhether to hold the certificated Notes directly or in street name will be up to the investor. Investors must consult their own banks or brokers to find out how to have their\ninterests in a Global Note transferred on termination to their own names, so that they will be holders of the Notes. See \"—Form, Exchange and Transfer of Certificated\nRegistered Securities.”\nPayment and Paying Agents\nWe will pay interest to the person listed in the trustee’s records as the owner of the Notes at the close of business on the record date for the applicable interest payment date,\neven if that person no longer owns the Note on the interest payment date. Because we pay all the interest for an interest period to the holders on the record date, holders\nbuying and selling the Notes must work out between themselves the appropriate purchase price. The most common manner is to adjust the sales price of the Notes to prorate\ninterest fairly between buyer and seller based on their respective ownership periods within the particular interest period.\nPayments on Global Notes\nWe will make payments on the Notes so long as they are represented by Global Notes in accordance with the applicable policies of the depositary in effect from time to time.\nUnder those policies, we will make payments directly to the depositary, or its nominee, and not to any indirect holders who own beneficial interest in the Global Notes. An\nindirect holder’s right to those payments will be governed by the rules and practices of the depositary and its participants.\nPayments on Certificated Securities\nIn the event the Notes become represented by certificates, we will make payments on the Notes as follows. We will pay interest that is due on an interest payment date by\ncheck mailed on the interest payment date to the holder of the Note at his or her address shown on the trustee’s records as of the close of business on the record date. We will\nmake all payments of principal by check or wire transfer at the office of the trustee in the contiguous United States and/or at other offices that may be specified in the indenture\nor a notice to holders against surrender of the Note.\nPayment When Offices Are Closed\nIf any payment is due on the Notes on a day that is not a business day, we will make the payment on the next day that is a business day. Payments made on the next business\nday in this situation will be treated under the indenture as if they were made on the original due date. Such payment will not result in a default under the Notes or the indenture,\nand no interest will accrue on the payment amount from the original due date to the next day that is a business day.\nBook-entry and other indirect holders should consult their banks or brokers for information on how they will receive payments on the Notes.\nForm, Exchange and Transfer of Certificated Registered Securities\n16\nNotes in physical, certificated form will be issued and delivered to each person that DTC identifies as a beneficial owner of the related Notes only if:\n● DTC notified us at any time that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Notes;\n● DTC ceases to be registered as a clearing agency under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; or\n● an Event of Default with respect to such Global Note has occurred and is continuing.\nHolders may exchange their certificated securities for Notes of smaller denominations or combined into fewer Notes of larger denominations, as long as the total principal\namount is not changed and as long as the denomination is equal to or greater than $25.\nHolders may exchange or transfer their certificated securities at the office of the trustee. We have appointed the trustee to act as our agent for registering the Notes in the name\nof holders transferring Notes. We may at any time designate additional transfer agents or rescind the designation of any transfer agent or approve a change in the office\nthrough which any transfer agent acts.\nHolders will not be required to pay a service charge for any registration of transfer or exchange of their certificated securities, but they may be required to pay any tax or other\ngovernmental charge associated with the registration of transfer or exchange. The transfer or exchange will be made only if our transfer agent is satisfied with the holder’s\nproof of legal ownership.\nIf we redeem any of the Notes, we may block the transfer or exchange of those Notes selected for redemption during the period beginning 15 days before the day we deliver the\nnotice of redemption and ending on the day of such delivery, in order to determine or fix the list of holders. We may also refuse to register transfers or exchanges of any\ncertificated Notes selected for redemption, except that we will continue to permit transfers and exchanges of the unredeemed portion of any Note that will be partially redeemed.\nAbout the Trustee\nWilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB is the trustee under the indenture and the principal paying agent and registrar for the Notes. The trustee may resign or be removed\nwith respect to the Notes provided that a successor trustee is appointed to act with respect to the Notes.\n17\nExhibit 21.1\nSubsidiaries of Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nEntity State of Formation\nRamaco Development, LLC Delaware\nRam Mining, LLC Delaware\nRamaco Coal Sales, LLC Delaware\nRamaco Resources, LLC Delaware\nRamaco Resources Land Holdings, LLC Delaware\nRamaco Coal, Inc.

Sussman\nJeremy R. Sussman\nChief Financial Officer\nExhibit 95.1\nFederal Mine Safety and Health Act Information\nWe work to prevent accidents and occupational illnesses. We have in place health and safety programs that include extensive employee training, safety incentives, drug and alcohol testing and safety\naudits. The objectives of our health and safety programs are to provide a safe work environment, provide employees with proper training and equipment and implement safety and health rules, policies\nand programs that foster safety excellence.\nOur mining operations are subject to extensive and stringent compliance standards established pursuant to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the \"Mine Act”). Mine Safety and Health\nAdministration (\"MSHA”) monitors and rigorously enforces compliance with these standards, and our mining operations are inspected frequently. Citations and orders are issued by MSHA under\nSection 104 of the Mine Act for violations of the Mine Act or any mandatory health or safety standard, rule, order or regulation promulgated under the Mine Act.\nSection 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act”) and Item 104 of Regulation S-K requires issuers to include in periodic reports filed with the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission certain information relating to citations or orders for violations of standards under the Mine Act. We present information below regarding certain mining safety\nand health violations, orders and citations, issued by MSHA and related assessments and legal actions and mine-related fatalities with respect to our coal mining operations. In evaluating this\ninformation, consideration should be given to factors such as: (i) the number of violations, orders and citations will vary depending on the size of the coal mine, (ii) the number of violations, orders and\ncitations issued will vary from inspector to inspector and mine to mine, and (iii) violations, orders and citations can be contested and appealed, and in that process, are often reduced in severity and\namount, and are sometimes dismissed.\nThe following tables include information required by the Dodd-Frank Act and Item 404 of Regulation S-K for the current year.

Introduction\nThe Board of Directors (the \"Board”) of Ramaco Resources, Inc. (the \"Company”) has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company to adopt a policy\nproviding for the recoupment by the Company of certain Incentive-Based Compensation paid to Executives Officers in the case of a Restatement (as defined below) (the\n\"Policy”). In such case, the Company (a) may recoup the Incentive-Based Compensation that was paid or that vested and (b) may cancel any outstanding or unearned\nIncentive-Based Compensation.\n2. Definitions\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:\n\"Committee” means the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company.\n\"Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation received that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that\notherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts resulting from a Restatement, and must be computed without regard to any taxes\npaid. For Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to\nmathematical recalculation directly from the information in a Restatement: (a) the amount must be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Restatement on the stock\nprice or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was received; and (b) the Company must maintain documentation of the determination of that\nreasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the Nasdaq Stock Market.\n\"Executive Officer” means any employee of the Company who is currently, or within the period covered by this Policy, employed as the Company’s president,\nprincipal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), any vice-president of the Company in charge of a principal\nbusiness unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance), any other officer who performs a significant policy-making function, or any other person who\nperforms similar significant policy-making functions for the Company, including Executive Officers of the Company’s subsidiaries if they perform such policy making functions\nfor the Company, and shall include each Named Executive Officer as determined under Section 402(a)(3) of Regulation S-K.\n\"Financial Reporting Measures” mean those measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the\nCompany’s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures. Stock price and total shareholder return are also Financial Reporting\nMeasures. A Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented within the financial statements or included in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\"Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting\nMeasure. For purposes of this Policy, Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed received in the Company’s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure\nspecified in the award is attained, even if the payment or grant occurs after the end of that period.\n\"Non-Employee Board” means the members of the Board who are not employed by the Company or any affiliate thereof.\n\"Recoupment Rules” means Rule 10D-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 5608 of the Nasdaq Stock Market.\n\"Restatement” means an accounting restatement required to be prepared by the Company due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial\nreporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to\nthe previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current\nperiod. The date of a Restatement shall be the earlier to occur of: (a) the date the Company’s board of directors, a committee of the board of directors, or the officer or officers\nof the Company authorized to take such action if board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare a\nRestatement; or (b) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare a Restatement. The Company’s obligation to recover\nErroneously Awarded Compensation is not dependent on if or when restated financial statements are filed.\n3. Administration of this Policy\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Committee. The Committee shall have full power and authority to construe and interpret this Policy, and to recommend to the\nNon-Employee Board its determinations as to whether recoupment is required under the Policy, the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation to recoup from an Executive\nOfficer and whether any other action should be taken pursuant to Section 6 of the Policy. Upon the approval of the Committee’s recommendations by a majority of the\nmembers of the Non-Employee Board (even if less than a quorum), the final decision shall be binding and conclusive on all parties.\n4. Recoupment of Incentive Compensation\nIn the event that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement, the Company must recover reasonably promptly the Erroneously Awarded Compensation\nreceived by a person (a) after beginning service as an Executive Officer, (b) who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for that Incentive-\nBased Compensation, and (c) during the recovery period described in Section 5 below. Recovery is subject only to those exceptions set forth in the Recoupment Rules.\nThe Committee can recommend that the Non-Employee Board recoup from the Executive Officer all or a portion of the following in order to satisfy the Executive\nOfficer’s recoupment obligation:\nCash Incentive Plan: The Committee can recommend that the Non-Employee Board (i) cancel and forfeit the Executive Officer’s annual or other cash incentive\nopportunity for the then current plan year, and/or (ii) require repayment of any annual or other cash incentive awards previously paid for prior years within the period\ndescribed in Section 5.\nLong Term Incentive Plan (LTIP): The Committee can recommend that the Non-Employee Board (i) cancel and forfeit any outstanding LTIP awards, (ii) require the\nExecutive Officer to return a number of shares of Company stock received upon vesting and settlement of any restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards during the\nperiod described in Section 5 (or pay the cash value of such shares), and (iii) require the Executive Officer to return a number of shares received upon the exercise of any stock\noptions during the period described in Section 5 (or pay the cash value of such shares). The cash value shall be determined as of the date of the Committee’s demand for\nrecoupment.\nThe Committee can also recommend that the Non-Employee Board recoup similar compensation under any subsequently adopted plans, arrangements or agreements\nor compensation under any non-qualified deferred compensation arrangements.\n5. Limitation on Period for Recoupment\nIn the event that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement, the Company must recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation received by Executive Officers\nduring the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement, and any transition period (that results from a\nchange in the Company’s fiscal year) of less than nine months within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years.\n6. No Impairment of Other Remedies\nThis Policy shall not preclude the Committee from recommending that the Non-Employee Board take any other action to enforce an Executive Officer’s obligation to\nthe Company, including termination of employment, institution of civil proceedings, or action to effect criminal proceedings.\n7. Miscellaneous\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any provision of applicable law, including the Recoupment Rules, requires non-discretionary recoupment or would result\nin a larger recoupment than permitted under this Policy, the provision of such applicable law shall supersede the relevant provisions of this Policy.\n8. Effective Date\nThis Policy shall apply to all Incentive Compensation paid, awarded or granted on or after October 2, 2023.\nPolicy Acknowledgment and Consent\nI hereby acknowledge that I have been designated an Executive Officer, I acknowledge and agree to the terms of this Policy, I agree to fully cooperate with the\nCompany in connection with the enforcement of the Policy, including the repayment by or recovery from me of Erroneously Awarded Compensation, and I agree that the\nCompany may enforce its rights under the Policy through any and all reasonable means permitted under applicable law as the Company deems necessary or appropriate under\nthe Policy."

This year, we made strong progress toward\nour goal of more than doubling production, to over 7\nmillion tons over the medium term. Ramaco anticipates Adjusted EBITDA*\ngrowing met coal production by over 30% in 2024 compared\nto the previous year, after growing production by almost Up 130%\n20% in 2023. In addition, discoveries by a Department of\nEnergy laboratory related to our Rare Earth Element\n2021-2023\ndeposits in Wyoming drove new interest in the company in\n2023, and opened the potential for Ramaco to be a major US\nsupplier of critical materials for many decades. We have\nminimal AROs, net debt and legacy liabilities, as well as\nstrong free cash flow generation, offering an attractive capital\nstructure and some of the industry’s top shareholder returns. * Adjusted EBITDA and Net Debt are used as supplemental non-\nGAAP financial measures by management and external users of\nour financial statements. Please see the reconciliation of these\nmeasures to the comparable GAAP measures on page 6.\nGlobal\nCoal Sales\nRamaco coal has been sold into 20 countries, having\nrecently increased its Asian footprint. In 2023, we sold\n3.5 million tons to customers in the US and around\nthe world. In the second half of 2023, we achieved our\noriginal goal from the time of the IPO to ship at a 4\nmillion ton annualized run-rate, with roughly two-\nthirds of our coal getting sold overseas in 2023.\nKey Financial Metrics\nSweden\nFinland\nUK\nCanada Netherlands\nPoland\nBelgium Germany Ukraine\nCzech Republic\nRomania\nSouth Korea\nUSA Spain Italy Turkey\nJapan\nIndia\nIndonesia\nBrazil\nSouth Africa\nAdjusted\nRevenue Net Income Dividends EBITDA* Employees\n$694M $82M $26M $182M 811\n* Adjusted EBITDA and Net Debt are used as supplemental non-GAAP financial measures by management and external users\nof our financial statements.

Business\nRamaco Resources, Inc. is a Delaware corporation formed in October 2016. Our Class A and Class B common\nstock are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbols “METC” and “METCB,” respectively. Our\n9.00% Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Senior Notes”) are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol\n“METCL”. Our principal corporate offices are located in Lexington, Kentucky. As used herein, “Ramaco Resources,”\n“Ramaco,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” and similar terms include Ramaco Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries,\nunless the context indicates otherwise.\nGeneral\nWe are an operator and developer of high-quality, low-cost metallurgical coal in southern West Virginia and\nsouthwestern Virginia. We are a pure play metallurgical coal company with 59 million reserve tons and 1,119 million\nmeasured and indicated resource tons of high-quality metallurgical coal. We believe our advantaged reserve geology\nprovides us with higher productivity and industry-leading lower cash costs.\nOur development portfolio primarily includes the following properties: Elk Creek, Berwind, Knox Creek, and\nMaben. We believe each of these properties possesses geologic and logistical advantages that make our coal among the\nlowest delivered-cost U.S. metallurgical coal to our domestic target customer base, North American blast furnace steel\nmills and coke plants, as well as international metallurgical coal consumers. We also control mineral deposits near\nSheridan, Wyoming as part of the Company’s initiatives regarding the potential recovery of rare earth elements as well\nas the potential commercialization of coal-to-carbon-based products and materials.\nOur operations include six active mines at our Elk Creek mining complex (the “Elk Creek Complex”), three\nactive mines at our Berwind mining complex (the “Berwind Complex”), two active mines at our Knox Creek mining\ncomplex (the “Knox Creek Complex”), and one active mine at our Maben mining complex (the “Maben Complex”).\n4\nTable of Contents\nDevelopment of the Elk Creek Complex commenced in 2016 and included the construction of a preparation\nplant and rail load-out facilities. The Elk Creek property consists of approximately 20,200 acres of controlled mineral\nrights and contains approximately 16 seams that we have targeted for production. Expansion of the Elk Creek\npreparation plant occurred during 2022 and 2023 in order to increase production.\nDevelopment of the Berwind Complex began in late 2017. In 2020, we suspended development at the Berwind\nComplex due to lower pricing and demand largely caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. In early-2021, as pricing and\ndemand improved, Berwind development was restarted. We successfully reached the thicker Pocahontas No. 4 seam in\nlate 2021. The Berwind property consists of approximately 62,500 acres of controlled mineral rights, including the\nDecember 2021 acquisition of “Amonate Assets” from subsidiaries of Coronado Global Resources Inc. (“Coronado”) in\n2021. The Amonate Assets include a processing plant located in our Berwind Complex, saving us transportation costs to\nour Knox Creek plant 26 miles away. The Berwind Complex experienced an ignition event in 2022 that resulted in idling\nmining operations for one of the active mines. Production restarted for the idle mine in the first quarter of 2023.\nOur Knox Creek Complex includes a preparation plant and 64,050 acres of controlled mineral rights that we\nexpect to develop in the future. The Knox Creek preparation plant processed some coal from our Berwind Complex in\n2023 as well as coal purchased from third parties.\nThe Maben Coal acquisition in 2022 provides the Company with 28,000 leased acres of controlled mineral\nrights, which includes coal deposits that may be mined currently by surface and high wall mining methods as well as\ndeveloped in the future through deep mining.\nOur RAM Mine property is located in southwestern Pennsylvania. Following years of delays, the Pennsylvania\nDepartment of Environmental Protection issued a denial of the RAM Mine permit. While the Company believes that the\nRAM permit was denied incorrectly and capriciously, we will not appeal the denial of the permit and will instead focus\non our other core properties and monetize these assets at the appropriate time.\nOur Brook Mine property consists of approximately 16,000 acres of controlled mineral rights and a research\nand development facility that were acquired as part of the purchase of Ramaco Coal in 2022. The mine is currently\nundergoing mineral analysis and core drilling assessment to assess the potential concentrations of rare earth elements.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our estimated aggregate annual production capacity is just under four million clean\ntons of coal. We plan to complete development of our existing properties and increase annual production over the next\nfew years to approximately seven million clean tons of metallurgical coal annually, subject to market conditions,\npermitting, and additional capital deployment. We may also acquire additional reserves or infrastructure that contribute\nto our focus on advantaged geology and lower costs.\nMetallurgical Coal Industry\nMetallurgical coal, also known as “met coal “ or “coking coal,” is a key component of the blast furnace\nsteelmaking process and, therefore, demand for such coal is highly correlated with conditions in the steel industry. The\nmetallurgical coal global market has grown steadily in recent years and is expected to continue to do so over the next\nfew years.\nUnited States metallurgical coal mines are primarily located in the Appalachian area of the eastern U.S.\nImported metallurgical coal has historically been uneconomic due to transportation costs and availability of domestic\nsupply. Metallurgical coal is transported to domestic customers by truck, rail, barge and vessel. Metallurgical coal\ncontracts in North America are typically 12-month, calendar year contracts where both prices and volumes are fixed.\nThese contracts are normally negotiated and entered into during the third and fourth quarters of the preceding calendar\nyear.\nU.S. metallurgical coal is also exported to the seaborne market and sold to buyers in Europe, South America,\nAfrica, and Asia. U.S. metallurgical coal exports are primarily sold to buyers in the Atlantic Basin market (customers in\nEurope, Brazil and Africa), and serve as swing supply to buyers in the Pacific Basin (customers in India, South Korea,\n5\nTable of Contents\nJapan and China). U.S. metallurgical coal exports compete with Australian metallurgical coals that are generally\nproduced at a lower cost but are geographically disadvantaged to the Atlantic Basin. Conversely, Australian production\nhas a much shorter logistical route to Pacific Basin customers. Any supply shortfall out of Australia, or increase in global\ndemand beyond Australia’s capacity, has historically been serviced by U.S. and Canadian metallurgical coal producers.\nExport metallurgical coal pricing is determined utilizing a series of indices from a number of independent\nsources and is adjusted for coal quality. Contracted export volumes have terms that vary in duration from spot cargoes\nto one year, rarely exceeding one year. In some cases, indices are used to calculate pricing at the point that the coal\nchanges hands. In other cases, an average value of indices over time may be utilized. While the term “benchmark” is\nstill utilized, it too is determined based on index values, typically for the preceding three months.\nMetallurgical coals are generally classified as high, medium or low-volatile (“vol”). Volatiles are products,\nother than water, that are released as gas or vapor when coal is converted to coke. Carbon is the primary element that\nremains when the volatiles are released.\nOur Strategy\nOur business strategy is to increase stockholder value through sustained earnings growth, cash flow generation\nand dividends by:\nDeveloping and Operating Our Metallurgical Coal Properties. We have 59 million reserve tons and 1,119\nmillion measured and indicated resource tons of high-quality metallurgical coal with attractive quality characteristics\nacross high-volatility and low-volatility segments. This geologically advantaged resource and reserve base allows for\nflexible capital spending in challenging market conditions.\nWe plan to complete development of our existing properties and increase annual production over the next few\nyears to approximately seven million clean tons of metallurgical coal, subject to market conditions, permitting, and\nadditional capital deployment. We may also acquire additional reserves or infrastructure that contribute to our focus on\nadvantaged geology and lower costs.\nBeing a Low-Cost U.S. Producer of Metallurgical Coal. Our reserve base presents advantaged geologic\ncharacteristics such as relatively thick coal seams at the deep mines, a low effective mining ratio at the surface mines,\nand desirable metallurgical coal quality. These characteristics contribute to a production profile that has a cash cost of\nproduction that is significantly below most U.S. metallurgical coal producers.\nMaintaining a Conservative Capital Structure and Prudently Managing the Business for the Long Term. We are\ncommitted to maintaining a conservative capital structure with a reasonable amount of debt that will afford us the\nfinancial flexibility to execute our business strategies on an ongoing basis.\nEnhancing Coal Purchase Opportunities. Depending on market conditions, we purchase coal from other\nindependent producers. Purchased coal is complementary from a blending standpoint with our produced coals or it may\nalso be sold as an independent product.\nDemonstrating Excellence in Safety and Environmental Stewardship. We are committed to complying with\nboth regulatory and our high standards for environmental and employee health and safety requirements. We believe that\nbusiness excellence is achieved through the pursuit of safer and more productive work practices.\nAdvancing our Initiatives in Rare Earth Elements and Advanced Carbon Products. We are also focused on\ncritical mineral rare earth development as well as the potential commercialization of coal-to-carbon-based products and\nmaterials. These initiatives provide additional growth opportunities and upside potential in future periods.\n6\nTable of Contents\nOur Projects\nOur properties are primarily located in southern West Virginia, southwestern Virginia, southwestern\nPennsylvania, and northeastern Wyoming. The following map shows the location of our mining complexes and projects,\nexcluding our properties located in Pennsylvania and Wyoming:\nElk Creek Mining Complex\nOur Elk Creek Complex in southern West Virginia began production in late December 2016. The Elk Creek\nproperty consists of approximately 20,200 acres of controlled mineral rights and contains 16 seams that we believe are\neconomically mineable. Nearly all our seams contain high-quality, high-volatile metallurgical coal accessible at or above\ndrainage. Additionally, almost all of this coal is high-fluidity, which is an important factor for high-volatile metallurgical\ncoal.\nWe control the majority of the coal and related mining rights within the existing permitted areas and our current\nmine plans, as well as the surface for our surface facilities, through lease agreements with McDonald Land Company\namong others. We estimate that the Elk Creek Complex contains reserves capable of yielding approximately 28 million\n7\nTable of Contents\ntons of clean saleable metallurgical coal as well as measured and indicated metallurgical coal resource tons of 215\nmillion. We estimate that the mine life for the Elk Creek Complex is over 20 years.\nWe currently market most of the coal produced from the Elk Creek Complex as a blended high-volatile A/B\nproduct. When segregated, a portion of our coal can be sold as a high-volatile A product for a premium. Our market for\nElk Creek production is principally North American coke and steel producers. We also market our coal to European,\nSouth American, Asian and African customers, and occasionally to coal traders and brokers for use in filling orders for\ntheir blended products. Additionally, we seek to market a portion of our coal in the specialty coal markets that value low\nash content.\nWe process our Elk Creek coal production through the preparation plant located on-site at the complex, which\nhas a heavy-media vessel, large-diameter heavy-media cyclone, dual-stage spiral concentrators, froth flotation,\nhorizontal vibratory and screen bowl centrifuges. Our rail load-out facilities at Elk Creek are served by the CSX railroad;\nhowever, we also have the ability to develop on controlled property a rail-loading facility on the Norfolk Southern\nrailroad, which would facilitate dual rail service. We have not yet committed capital for the development of a Norfolk\nSouthern rail facility.\nThe combined refuse capacity at the active disposal areas is expected to provide over 20 years of disposal life\nfor our operations with additional refuse areas being permitted. We completed construction of a full complement of plate\npresses during 2020 to allow for dewatering of material which then was being pumped as slurry to our impoundment.\nThis equipment allows us to process all waste material for placement in areas designed for combined refuse disposal and\nmaximize the life for disposal of fine waste rock in the pool of the impoundment.\nA large portion of our controlled reserves are permitted through existing, issued permits, and we continue\nactively pursuing multiple new permits.\nOn January 3, 2020, we entered into a mineral lease with the McDonald Land Company for coal reserves\nwhich, in many cases, are located immediately adjacent to our Elk Creek Complex. This leased property became\navailable after the former base lease with another party was terminated. The prior lessee, who controlled the property\nsince 1978, did not produce commercial amounts of coal from the property during their possession of the lease. While it\nis unusual to have a metallurgical reserve in this part of Central Appalachia remain idle for such an extended period of\ntime, the configuration and location of the tracts lend themselves to be mined and processed far more efficiently from\nour Elk Creek property. The McDonald reserves have the same geologic advantages and low costs that are being\nexperienced in our Elk Creek mines.\nDuring 2022, we began work on a throughput upgrade at our Elk Creek Preparation plant. The upgrade, which\nwas completed in 2023, increased our annual processing capacity for this complex to approximately three million tons\nper year. In order to utilize the increased capacity, we also began development work on additional low-cost, high-\nvolatile mines at Elk Creek, which began production during 2022.\nBerwind Mining Complex\nOur Berwind Complex is located on the border of West Virginia and Virginia and is well-positioned to fill the\nanticipated market for low-volatile coals. The Berwind property consists of approximately 62,500 acres of controlled\nmineral rights, including the Amonate acquisition. We estimate that the Berwind Complex contains reserves capable of\nyielding approximately 23 million tons of clean saleable metallurgical coal as well as measured and indicated\nmetallurgical coal resource tons of 629 million. We estimate that the mine life for the Berwind Complex is over\n20 years. We view Berwind as the second flagship complex for Ramaco.\nDevelopment of our Berwind Complex began in late 2017 in the thinner Pocahontas No. 3 seam and has since\nsloped up to current mining in the thicker Pocahontas No. 4 seam. In 2020, we suspended development at the Berwind\nComplex due to lower pricing and demand largely caused by the economic effects of COVID-19. In early 2021, as\npricing and demand improved, Berwind development resumed, and we successfully reached the Pocahontas No. 4 seam\n8\nTable of Contents\nin late 2021. The Berwind Complex experienced an ignition event during the third quarter of 2022 that resulted in idling\nmining operations for one of the active mines. Production restarted for the idle mine in the first quarter of 2023.\nWe have the necessary permits for the Berwind Complex for our current and budgeted operations. A permit for\nour Squire Jim seam room-and-pillar underground mine was issued in 2020 and contains a large area of Squire Jim seam\ncoal deposits. The Squire Jim seam of coal is the lowest known coal seam on the geologic column in this region, and due\nto the depth of cover has never been significantly explored. At this point, we do not anticipate activating this mining\npermit.\nIn December 2021, we acquired the Amonate Assets from Coronado, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement.\nThe acquisition included a mine complex located in McDowell County, West Virginia and Tazewell County, Virginia\nadjacent and contiguous to the Company’s existing Berwind Complex. The assets primarily consist of high-quality, low\nand mid-volatile metallurgical coal reserves and resources, much of which will be mined from the Company’s Berwind\nComplex. Also purchased were several additional permitted mines and an idled 1.3 million ton per annum capacity coal\npreparation plant with a rail loading facility.\nWe began mine development on the Amonate Assets shortly after acquisition, and production began in the first\nquarter of 2022. The preparation plant and rail loading facility were refurbished in 2022 and began operation in the\nfourth quarter of 2022. Rail service is provided by Norfolk Southern.\nKnox Creek Mining Complex\nThe Knox Creek Complex consists of approximately 64,050 acres of controlled mineral rights as well as a\npreparation plant, a coal-loading facility, and a refuse impoundment. Rail service is provided by Norfolk Southern.\nThe Tiller Mine slope face-up and shafts were idled before our acquisition of the property. The Company has\nspent limited amounts of capital to review the feasibility of a high-vol A metallurgical deep mine in the Jawbone seam of\ncoal. This seam is located slightly above the Tiller Seam and would be accessed via a short slope from within the\nexisting Tiller seam mine. Jawbone coal could flow through the same portal and slope as the idle Tiller mine. Production\nis expected to resume once warranted by market conditions. We estimate that the Knox Complex contains reserves\ncapable of yielding approximately 8 million tons of clean saleable metallurgical coal as well as measured and indicated\nmetallurgical coal resource tons of 275 million. We estimate that the mine life for the Knox Creek Complex is\napproximately 15 years.\nFrom time to time, we process coal purchased from other independent producers at the Knox Creek preparation\nplant and load-out facilities. We have also processed and loaded coal from our Berwind Complex at this facility.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, we acquired multiple permits from various affiliates of Omega Highwall Mining,\nLLC. These permits are in close proximity to our Knox Creek preparation plant and loadout infrastructure and provide\nimmediate access to two separate mining areas in Southwestern Virginia. One is a deep mine permit in the Jawbone\nSeam, a geologically advantaged metallurgical coal reserve and resource. The second is a metallurgical surface mine in\nthe Tiller seam that is mined via surface and highwall mining methods.\nIn August 2021, we began production at the Big Creek surface mine. We added a highwall miner in the fourth\nquarter of 2021. The mine reached full production during 2023.\nRAM Mine\nFollowing years of delays, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection issued a denial of the\nRAM Mine permit in southwest Pennsylvania. While the Company believes that the RAM permit was denied incorrectly\nand capriciously, we will not appeal the denial of the permit and will instead focus on our other core properties and\nmonetize these assets at the appropriate time.\n9\nTable of Contents\nMaben Complex\nThe Maben property is located in southern West Virginia and consists of approximately 28,000 acres of\ncontrolled mineral rights acquired from the purchase of Maben Coal in the third quarter of 2022. As part of the\ntransaction, we assumed existing mining permits issued by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection,\nwhich authorizes mining by both surface and highwall mining methods as well as by underground methods. The\nproperty also has issued permits covering an existing haul road as well as an active refuse disposal area together with a\npreparation plant and unit train loadout, neither of which had been constructed as of the closing date. In early 2024, the\nCompany completed the purchase of an existing coal preparation plant, which will be relocated to the Company’s Maben\nComplex.\nThe Maben property contains various areas of high-quality low-vol metallurgical coal in the Sewell, Beckley,\nPocahontas 3, Pocahontas 4, and Pocahontas 6 seams of coal. The Company expects that coal contained in the Sewell\nseam will be mined by surface and high-wall mining methods. Initial production began in 2023, reaching an annualized\nproduction rate of approximately 250,000 tons of low-volatile coal. The Company will consider deep mine development\nof coal contained in Beckley, Pocahontas 3, 4, and 6 seams at a future point. Although the Company currently utilizes\nthe Berwind preparation plant, such development would require the construction of a new preparation plant and loadout\nas mentioned above, which is under way.\nBrook Mine\nThe property is located in northeastern Wyoming, near Sheridan, and consists of approximately 16,000 acres of\ncontrolled mineral rights and a research and development facility that were acquired as part of the purchase of Ramaco\nCoal during 2022. The property includes a thermal coal deposit and permit as well as occurrences of rare earth elements.\nThe mine is currently undergoing mineral analysis and core drilling assessment to assess the potential concentrations of\nrare earth elements. This property is being used to support the Company’s possible expansion into the manufacture and\ncommercialization of advanced carbon products and materials from coal.\nThree drillhole programs involving a total of 123 new core drillholes specifically targeting rare earth elements\n(REEs) have been completed within the current Brook Mine permit area. So far, the results of these drilling programs\nindicate elevated levels of REEs, along with significant concentrations of other critical elements such as Yttrium,\nGallium, and Germanium. Work is ongoing to evaluate the potential exploitation of these minerals within the current\nBrook Mine permit area.\nCustomers and Contracts\nCoal prices differ substantially by region and are impacted by many factors including the overall economy,\ndemand for steel, demand for electricity, location, market, quality and type of coal, mine operation costs and the cost of\ncustomer alternatives. The major factors influencing our business are the global economy and demand for steel.\nWe market the bulk of our production to North American integrated steel mills and coke plants, as well as\ninternational customers in Europe, South America, Asia and Africa. Additionally, we market limited amounts of our\nproduction to various premium-priced specialty markets, such as foundry cokemakers, manufacturers of activated carbon\nproducts, and specialty metals producers.\nCoal quality and volumes are stipulated in coal sales agreements, and, in many cases, the annual pricing and\nvolumes are fixed. Our contracts with customers typically require us to deliver coal with minimum specifications or\nqualities. Variances from these specifications or qualities are settled by employing price adjustments.\nGenerally, the Company’s domestic sales contracts have terms of about one year and the pricing is typically\nfixed. Export sales have spot or term contracts, and pricing can be either fixed or derived against index-based pricing\nmechanisms.\n10\nTable of Contents\nWe sold 3.5 million tons of coal during 2023. Of this, 33% was sold to North American markets and 67% was\nsold into export markets, excluding Canada. Principally, our export market sales were made to Europe. During 2023,\nsales to three customers accounted for approximately 41% of total revenue. No other customer accounted for 10% or\nmore of our total revenue during 2023. If a major customer decided to stop purchasing coal or significantly reduced its\npurchases from us, revenue could decline and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nTrade Names, Trademarks and Patents\nWe do not have any registered trademarks or trade names for our traditional products and services or\nsubsidiaries, nor do we believe that any trademark or trade name is material to our metallurgical coal business. The\nnames of the seams in which we have coal reserves, and attributes thereof, are widely recognized in the metallurgical\ncoal market. However, trademarks related to our advanced carbon products business could become material depending\non future developments.\nIn connection with our advanced carbon products business, the Company holds 61 intellectual property patents\nand pending patents related to the conversion of low-cost carbon ore into higher-value carbon products as well as\nexclusive licensing agreements, all of which have a remaining duration of 14-20 years.\nCompetition\nOur principal domestic competitors include Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc., Blackhawk Mining, LLC,\nCoronado Global Resources Inc., Arch Resources, Inc., Peabody Energy Corporation and Warrior Met Coal, Inc. We\nalso compete in international markets directly with domestic companies and with companies that produce coal from one\nor more foreign countries, such as Australia, Canada, and Colombia. Many of these coal producers are larger than we are\nand have greater financial resources and larger reserve bases than we do.\nSuppliers\nSupplies used in our business include petroleum-based fuels, explosives, tires, conveyance structure, ventilation\nsupplies, lubricants and other raw materials as well as spare parts and other consumables used in the mining process. We\nuse third-party suppliers for a significant portion of our equipment rebuilds and repairs, drilling services and\nconstruction. We believe adequate substitute suppliers and contractors are available, and we are not dependent on any\none supplier or contractor. We continually seek to develop relationships with suppliers and contractors that focus on\nreducing our costs while improving quality and service.\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety and Other Regulatory Matters\nOur operations are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and\nregulations, such as those relating to permitting and licensing matters, employee health and safety, reclamation and\nrestoration of mining properties, water discharges, air emissions, plant and wildlife protection, the storage, treatment and\ndisposal of certain materials (including solid and hazardous wastes), remediation of contaminated sites, surface\nsubsidence from underground mining and the effects of mining on surface water and groundwater conditions.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations may be costly and time-consuming, delay the commencement,\ncontinuation or expansion of exploration or production at our facilities, and depress demand for our products by\nimposing more stringent requirements and limits on our customers’ operations. Moreover, these laws are constantly\nevolving, and the trend has been for increasingly complex and stringent regulation over time. New legislative or\nadministrative proposals, or judicial interpretations of existing laws and regulations related to the protection of the\nenvironment could result in substantially increased capital, operating and compliance costs.\nDue in part to these extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements and ever-changing interpretations of\nthese requirements, violations of these laws can occur from time to time in our industry and also in our operations.\nExpenditures relating to environmental compliance are a major cost consideration for our operations and safety and\n11\nTable of Contents\ncompliance is a significant factor in mine design, both to meet regulatory requirements and to minimize long-term\nenvironmental liabilities.\nThe following is a summary of the various federal and state environmental and similar regulations that have a\nmaterial impact on our business:\nSurface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (the\n“SMCRA”) establishes comprehensive operational, reclamation and closure standards for our mining operations and\nrequires that such standards be met during the course of and following completion of mining activities. The SMCRA\nalso stipulates compliance with many other major environmental statutes, including the Clean Air Act (the “CAA”), the\nClean Water Act (the “CWA”), the Endangered Species Act (the “ESA”), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act\n(the “RCRA”) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (the\n“CERCLA”). Permits for all mining operations must be obtained from the United States Office of Surface Mining\nReclamation and Enforcement (the “OSMRE”) or, where state regulatory agencies have adopted federally approved state\nprograms under SMCRA, the appropriate state regulatory authority. Our operations are located in West Virginia and\nVirginia, which have achieved primary jurisdiction for enforcement of SMCRA through approved state programs.\nThe SMCRA imposes a complex set of requirements covering all facets of coal mining. SMCRA regulations\ngovern, among other things, coal prospecting, mine plan development, topsoil or growth medium removal and\nreplacement, disposal of excess spoil and coal refuse, protection of the hydrologic balance, and suitable post mining land\nuses.\nFrom time to time, the OSMRE will also update its mining regulations under the SMCRA. For example, the\nOSMRE has previously sought to impose stricter stream protection requirements by requiring more extension pre-\nmining and baseline data for coal mining operations. The rule was disapproved by Congress pursuant to the\nCongressional Review Act. However, whether Congress will enact future legislation to require a new stream protection\nrule remains uncertain. The existing rules, or other new SMCRA regulations, could result in additional material costs,\nobligations and restrictions upon our operations.\nAbandoned Mine Lands Fund. The SMCRA also imposes a reclamation fee on all current mining operations,\nthe proceeds of which are deposited in the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund (the “AML Fund”), which is used to\nrestore unreclaimed and abandoned mine lands mined before 1977. The adjusted fees proposed in the Interim Final Rule\nper ton for October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2034 are (i) 22.4 cents per ton for surface-mined anthracite,\nbituminous, and subbituminous coal if the value per ton is $2.24 per ton or more, (ii) 9.6 cents per ton for underground-\nmined anthracite, bituminous, and subbituminous coal if the value per ton is $0.96 per ton, and (iii) 6.4 cents per ton for\nsurface- and underground-mined lignite coal if the value per ton is $3.20 per ton or more. The Interim Final Rule took\neffect in August 2022. Estimates of our total reclamation and mine-closing liabilities are based upon permit requirements\nand our experience related to similar activities. If these accruals are insufficient or our liability in a particular year is\ngreater than currently anticipated, our future operating results could be adversely affected.\nMining Permits and Approvals. Numerous governmental permits and approvals are required for mining\noperations. We are required to prepare and present to federal, state, and local authorities data detailing the effect or\nimpact that any proposed exploration project for production of coal may have upon the environment, the public and our\nemployees. The permitting rules are complex and continuously updated, and may be subject to discretionary\ninterpretations by regulators. Further, the laws, rules, and regulations that govern our mining operations authorize\nsubstantial fines and penalties, including revocation or suspension of mining permits under some circumstances.\nMonetary sanctions and, in certain circumstances, even criminal sanctions may be imposed for failure to comply with\nthese laws. Compliance with required permits and associated regulations may have a material adverse impact on our\noperations, earnings, or financial condition.\nApplications for permits and permit renewals associated with our mining operations are also subject to public\ncomment and potential legal challenges from third parties seeking to prevent a permit from being issued, or to overturn\nthe applicable agency’s grant of the permit. Should our permitting efforts become subject to such challenges, the permits\nmay not be issued in a timely fashion, may impose requirements which restrict our ability to conduct our mining\n12\nTable of Contents\noperations or to do so profitably, or may not be issued at all. Any delays, denials, or revocation of these or other similar\npermits we need to operate could reduce our production and materially adversely impact our cash flow and results of our\noperations.\nIn order to obtain mining permits and approvals from state regulatory authorities, mine operators must also\nsubmit a reclamation plan for restoring the mined property to its prior condition, productive use or other permitted\ncondition. The conditions of certain permits also require that we obtain surface-owner consent if the surface estate has\nbeen split from the mineral estate. This requires us to negotiate with third parties for surface access that overlies coal we\nacquired or intend to acquire. These negotiations can be costly and time-consuming, lasting years in some instances,\nwhich can create additional delays in the permitting process. If we cannot successfully negotiate for land access, we\ncould be denied a permit to mine coal we already own.\nFinally, we typically submit necessary mining permit applications several months, or even years, before we\nanticipate mining a new area. However, we cannot control the pace at which the government issues permits needed for\nnew or ongoing operations. For example, the process of obtaining CWA permits can be particularly time-consuming and\nsubject to delays and denials. The Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) also has the authority to veto permits\nissued by the U.S. Army Corps. of Engineers (the “Corps”) under the CWA’s Section 404 program that prohibits the\ndischarge of dredged or fill material into regulated waters without a permit. Even after we obtain the permits that we\nneed to operate, many of the permits must be periodically renewed, or may require modification. There is some risk that\nnot all existing permits will be approved for renewal, or that existing permits will be approved for renewal only upon\nterms that restrict or limit our operations in ways that may be material.\nFinancial Assurance. Federal and state laws require a mine operator to secure the performance of its\nreclamation and lease obligations under the SMCRA through the use of surety bonds or other approved forms of\nfinancial security for payment of certain long-term obligations, including mine closure or reclamation costs. The changes\nin the market for coal used to generate electricity in recent years have led to bankruptcies involving prominent coal\nproducers. Several of these companies relied on self-bonding to guarantee their responsibilities under the SMCRA\npermits including for reclamation. In response to these bankruptcies, the OSMRE issued a policy advisory in\nAugust 2016 to state agencies that was intended to discourage authorized states from approving self-bonding\narrangements (the “Policy Advisory”). Although the Policy Advisory was rescinded in October 2017, certain states,\nincluding Virginia, had previously announced that they would no longer accept self-bonding to secure reclamation\nobligations under the state mining laws. Additionally, in March 2018, the Government Accounting Office recommended\nthat Congress consider amending the SMCRA to eliminate the availability of self-bonding to guarantee responsibilities\nunder SMCRA permits. Individually and collectively, these and future revised various financial assurance requirements\nmay increase the amount of financial assurance needed and limit the types of acceptable instruments, straining the\ncapacity of the surety markets to meet demand. This may delay the timing for and increase the costs of obtaining the\nrequired financial assurance.\nWe use surety bonds, trusts and letters of credit to provide financial assurance for certain transactions and\nbusiness activities. Federal and state laws require us to obtain surety bonds to secure payment of certain long-term\nobligations including mine closure or reclamation costs and other miscellaneous obligations. The bonds are renewable\non a yearly basis. Surety bond rates have increased in recent years and the market terms of such bonds have generally\nbecome less favorable. Sureties typically require coal producers to post collateral, often having a value equal to 40% or\nmore of the face amount of the bond. As a result, we may be required to provide collateral, letters of credit or other\nassurances of payment in order to obtain the necessary types and amounts of financial assurance. Under our surety\nbonding program, we are not currently required to post any letters of credit or other collateral to secure the surety bonds;\nobtaining letters of credit in lieu of surety bonds could result in a significant cost increase. Moreover, the need to obtain\nletters of credit may also reduce amounts that we can borrow under any senior secured credit facility for other purposes.\nIf, in the future, we are unable to secure surety bonds for these obligations and are forced to secure letters of credit\nindefinitely or obtain some other form of financial assurance at too high of a cost, our profitability may be negatively\naffected.\nWe intend to maintain a credit profile that precludes the need to post collateral for our surety bonds.\nNonetheless, our surety has the right to demand additional collateral at its discretion.\n13\nTable of Contents\nSome international customers require new suppliers to post performance guarantees during the initial stages of\nqualifying to become a long-term supplier. To date we have not had to provide a performance guarantee, but it is\npossible that such a guarantee could be required in the future.\nMine Safety and Health. The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended (the “MINE Act”) and\nthe Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 (the “MINER Act”), and regulations issued under\nthese federal statutes, impose stringent health and safety standards on mining operations. The regulations that have been\nadopted under the Mine Act and the MINER Act are comprehensive and affect numerous aspects of mining operations,\nincluding training of mine personnel, mining procedures, roof control, ventilation, blasting, use and maintenance of\nmining equipment, dust and noise control, communications, emergency response procedures, and other matters. The\nMine Safety and Health Administration (the “MSHA”) regularly inspects mines to ensure compliance with regulations\npromulgated under the Mine Act and MINER Act.\nPennsylvania, West Virginia, and Virginia all have similar programs for mine safety and health regulation and\nenforcement. The various requirements mandated by federal and state statutes, rules, and regulations place restrictions\non our methods of operation and result in fees and civil penalties for violations of such requirements or criminal liability\nfor the knowing violation of such standards, significantly impacting operating costs and productivity.\nThe regulations enacted under the Mine Act and MINER Act as well as under similar state acts are routinely\nexpanded or made more stringent, raising compliance costs and increasing potential liability. Our compliance with\ncurrent or future mine health and safety regulations could increase our mining costs. At this time, it is not possible to\npredict the full effect that new or proposed statutes, regulations and policies will have on our operating costs, but any\nexpansion of existing regulations, or making such regulations more stringent, may have a negative impact on the\nprofitability of our operations. If we were to be found in violation of mine safety and health regulations, we could face\npenalties or restrictions that may materially and adversely impact our operations, financial results and liquidity.\nIn addition, government inspectors have the authority to issue orders to shut down our operations based on\nsafety considerations under certain circumstances, such as imminent dangers, accidents, failures to abate violations, and\nunwarrantable failures to comply with mandatory safety standards. If an incident were to occur at one of our operations,\nit could be shut down for an extended period of time, and our reputation with prospective customers could be materially\ndamaged. Moreover, if one of our operations is issued a notice of pattern of violations, then MSHA can issue an order\nwithdrawing the miners from the area affected by any enforcement action during each subsequent significant and\nsubstantial (“S&S”) citation until the S&S citation or order is abated.\nWorkers’ Compensation and Occupational Disease. We are insured for workers’ compensation benefits for\nwork related injuries that occur within our United States operations. We retain insurance coverage for all of our\nsubsidiaries and are insured for the statutory limits. Workers’ compensation liabilities, including those related to claims\nincurred but not reported, are recorded principally using annual valuations based on discounted future expected\npayments using historical data of the operating subsidiary or combined insurance industry data when historical data is\nlimited. State workers’ compensation acts typically provide for an exception to an employer’s immunity from civil\nlawsuits for workplace injuries in the case of intentional torts. However, West Virginia’s workers’ compensation act\nprovides a much broader exception to workers’ compensation immunity. The exception allows an injured employee to\nrecover against his or her employer where he or she can show damages caused by an unsafe working condition of which\nthe employer was aware that was a violation of a statute, regulation, rule or consensus industry standard. These types of\nlawsuits are not uncommon and could have a significant impact on our operating costs.\nIn addition, we obtained from a third-party insurer a workers’ compensation insurance policy, which includes\ncoverage for medical and disability benefits for occupational disease under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act\nof 1969 and the Mine Act. Under the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 and the Black Lung Benefits Reform\nAct of 1977, as amended in 1981, each coal mine operator must pay federal black lung benefits to claimants who are\ncurrent and former employees and also make payments to a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses\nto claimants who last worked in the coal industry prior to January 1, 1970.\n14\nTable of Contents\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 includes significant changes to the federal black lung\nprogram including an automatic survivor benefit paid upon the death of a miner with an awarded black lung claim and\nthe establishment of a rebuttable presumption with regard to pneumoconiosis among miners with 15 or more years of\ncoal mine employment that are totally disabled by a respiratory condition. These changes could have a material impact\non our costs expended in association with the federal black lung program. In addition to possibly incurring liability under\nfederal statutes, we may also be liable under state laws for black lung claims.\nClean Air Act. The CAA and comparable state laws that regulate air emissions affect coal mining operations\nboth directly and indirectly. Direct impacts on coal mining and processing operations include CAA permitting\nrequirements and emission control requirements relating to air pollutants, including particulate matter such as fugitive\ndust. The CAA indirectly impacts coal mining operations by extensively regulating the emissions of particulate matter,\nsulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury and other compounds emitted by coal-fired power plants. In addition to the\ngreenhouse gas (“GHG”) issues discussed below, the air emissions programs that may materially and adversely affect\nour operations, financial results, liquidity, and demand for our coal, directly or indirectly, include, but are not limited to,\nthe following:\n• Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. In July 2011, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (the\n“CSAPR”), a cap-and-trade program that requires 28 states in the Midwest and eastern seaboard of the U.S.\nto reduce power plant emissions that cross state lines and contribute to ozone and/or fine particle pollution\nin other states. In September 2016, the EPA finalized a rule that further limited summertime (May-\nSeptember) nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants in 22 states in the eastern United States beginning\nin May 2017 (the “CSAPR Update Rule”). For states to meet these requirements, a number of coal-fired\nelectric generating units will likely need to be retired, rather than retrofitted with the necessary emission\ncontrol technologies, reducing demand for thermal coal. Moreover, in September 2019, the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (“D.C. Circuit”) remanded the CSAPR Update Rule\nto the EPA on the grounds that it failed to timely require upwind states to control or eliminate their\ncontribution to ozone and/or fine particulate matter in downwind states, as required under the CAA. In\nOctober 2020, the EPA proposed a Revised CSAPR Update Rule in response to the D.C. Circuit’s ruling,\nwhich was finalized in April 2021. The final rule resolves 21 states’ outstanding interstate pollution\ntransport obligations and would require additional emissions reductions of nitrogen oxides from power\nplants in 12 states. Imposition of stricter deadlines for controlling downwind contribution could accelerate\nunit retirements or the need to implement emission control strategies. Any reduction in the amount of coal\nconsumed by electric power generators as a result of these limitations could decrease demand for thermal\ncoal.\n• Acid Rain. Title IV of the CAA requires reductions of sulfur dioxide emissions by electric utilities and\napplies to all coal-fired power plants generating greater than 25 megawatts of power. Affected power plants\nhave sought to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by switching to lower sulfur fuels, installing pollution\ncontrol devices, reducing electricity generating levels or purchasing or trading sulfur dioxide emission\nallowances. These reductions could impact our customers in the electric generation industry. These\nrequirements are not supplanted by the CSAPR.\n• NAAQS for Criterion Pollutants. The CAA requires the EPA to set standards, referred to as National\nAmbient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”), for six common air pollutants: carbon monoxide, nitrogen\ndioxide, lead, ozone, particulate matter (“PM”) and sulfur dioxide. Areas that are not in compliance\n(referred to as “non-attainment areas”) with these standards must take steps to reduce emissions levels. The\nEPA has adopted NAAQS for carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, lead, sulfur dioxide, PM and ground-\nlevel ozone. The CAA further requires the EPA to periodically review and revise the NAAQS, resulting in\nthe trend of more stringent standards over time. In February 2024, for example, the EPA published a final\nrule that revised the primary annual PM standard by lowering the level from 12.0 µg/m3 to 9.0 µg/m3.\n2.5\nStates with non-attainment areas must adopt a state implementation plan that demonstrates compliance with\nthe existing or new air quality standards. These plans could require significant additional emissions control\nexpenditures at coal-fired power plants. New rules and standards may also impose additional emissions\ncontrol requirements on our customers in the electric generation, steelmaking, and coke industries. Because\n15\nTable of Contents\ncoal mining operations emit particulate matter and sulfur dioxide, our mining operations could be affected\nwhen the new standards are implemented by the states.\n• Mercury and Hazardous Air Pollutants. The EPA has established emission standards for mercury and other\nmetals, fine particulates, and acid gases from coal- and oil-fired power plants through the Mercury and Air\nToxics Standards (“MATS”) rule. Like CSAPR, MATS and other similar future regulations could\naccelerate the retirement of a significant number of coal-fired power plants. Such retirements would likely\nadversely impact our business.\nGlobal Climate Change. Climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. There\nis widespread concern about the contributions of human activity to such changes, especially through the emission of\nGHGs. Numerous reports from scientific and governmental bodies such as the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel\non Climate Change have expressed heightened concerns about the impacts of human activity, especially fossil fuel\ncombustion, on the global climate. There are three primary sources of GHGs associated with the coal industry. First, the\nend use of our coal by our customers in electricity generation, coke plants, and steelmaking is a source of GHGs.\nSecond, combustion of fuel by equipment used in coal production and to transport our coal to our customers is a source\nof GHGs. Third, coal mining itself can release methane, which is considered to be a more potent GHG than carbon\ndioxide, directly into the atmosphere. These emissions from coal consumption, transportation and production are subject\nto pending and proposed regulation as part of initiatives to address global climate change.\nAs a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international,\nnational, regional, state and local levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs. Collectively, these\ninitiatives could result in higher electric costs to our customers or lower the demand for coal used in electric or steel\ngeneration, which could in turn adversely impact our business.\nAt present, we are principally focused on metallurgical coal production, which is not used in connection with\nthe production of power generation. However, we may seek to sell greater amounts of our coal into the power-generation\nmarket in the future. The market for our coal may be adversely impacted if comprehensive legislation or regulations\nfocusing on GHG emission reductions are adopted, or if our customers are unable to obtain financing for their\noperations.\nAt the international level, in April 2016, the United States joined the international community at the 21st\nConference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France, which\nresulted in an agreement intended to nationally determine their contributions and set GHG emission reduction goals\nevery five years beginning in 2020. In November 2019, plans were formally announced for the U.S. to withdraw from\nthe Paris Agreement with an effective exit date in November 2020. In February 2021, the current administration\nannounced reentry of the U.S. into the Paris Agreement along with a new “nationally determined contribution” for U.S.\nGHG emissions that would achieve emissions reductions of at least 50% relative to 2005 levels by 2030. In addition,\nshortly after taking office in January 2021, President Biden issued a series of executive orders designed to address\nclimate change. In November 2021, the 26th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework on Climate\nChange concluded with the finalization of the Glasgow Climate Pact, which aims to cut global methane pollution at least\n30% by 2030 relative to 2020 levels, including “all feasible reductions” in the energy sector. Forty-six countries signed\nonto a Global Coal to Clean Energy Transition Statement, committing to transition away from unabated coal power\ngeneration by about 2030 for “major economies” and a global transition by roughly 2040. Most recently, at the 27th\nconference of parties (“COP27”), President Biden announced the EPA’s proposed standards to reduce methane\nemissions from existing oil and gas sources, and agreed, in conjunction with the European Union and a number of other\npartner countries, to develop standards for monitoring and reporting methane emissions to help create a market for low\nmethane-intensity natural gas. Various state and local governments have also publicly committed to furthering the goals\nof the Paris Agreement. International commitments, reentry into the Paris Agreement and President Biden’s executive\norders may result in the development of additional regulations or changes to existing regulations that may impact our\nbusiness.\nThe $1 trillion legislative infrastructure package passed by Congress in November 2021 includes a number of\nclimate-focused spending initiatives targeted at climate resilience, enhanced response and preparation for extreme\n16\nTable of Contents\nweather events, and clean energy and transportation investments. In August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation\nReduction Act of 2022 into law. The law provides significant funding and incentives for research and development of\nlow-carbon energy production methods, carbon capture, and other programs directed at addressing climate change. The\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022 also provides significant funding for research and development of low-carbon energy\nproduction methods, carbon capture, and other programs directed at addressing climate change.\nFurthermore, the EPA has determined that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the\nenvironment, because emissions of GHGs are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth’s\natmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA, over time, has attempted to restrict emissions\nof GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. For example, in August 2015, the EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan\n(the “CPP”) to cut carbon emissions from existing power plants, which did not formally go into effect because the U.S.\nSupreme Court stayed its implementation in February 2016. In July 2019, the EPA adopted the Affordable Clean Energy\nRule (the “ACE Rule”) that repealed and replaced the CPP. The ACE Rule required states to set appropriate GHG\nemission standards for power plants within their jurisdiction based upon the application of “candidate” heat rate\nimprovement measures. In January 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE Rule and remanded it to the agency for\nfurther proceedings. In February 2021, the EPA issued a memorandum stating the agency’s position that neither the\nClean Power Plan nor the ACE Rule are in effect, and future regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from existing power\ngeneration facilities remains uncertain. In May 2023, the EPA proposed revised new source performance standards for\nGHG emissions from new and reconstructed power plants that undertake a large modification. The finalization of this\nrule and any future rules or future GHG emission standards may encourage a shift away from coal-fired power\ngeneration, adversely impacting the market for our product.\nAdditionally, on March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted final rules to require registrants to disclose certain climate-\nrelated information in registration statements and annual reports. The final rules will require the Company to disclose,\namong other things, material climate-related risks, information about our board of directors’ (“Board”) oversight of\nclimate-related risks, management’s role in managing material climate-related risks, and Scope 1 and Scope 2\ngreenhouse gas emissions. Compliance with these rules will be phased in over time based on our filing status as well as\nthe content of the disclosure and assurance requirements. Although the Company is in the process of evaluating the new\nrules, compliance may result in increased legal, accounting, and other compliance-related costs, as well as place strain on\nour personnel, systems, and resources.\nAt the state level, several states, including Pennsylvania and Virginia, have already adopted measures requiring\nGHG emissions to be reduced within state or regional boundaries, including cap-and-trade programs and the imposition\nof renewable energy portfolio standards. Various states and regions have also adopted GHG initiatives, and certain\ngovernmental bodies have imposed, or are considering the imposition of, fees or taxes based on the emission of GHGs\nby certain facilities. A number of states have also enacted legislative mandates requiring electricity suppliers to use\nrenewable energy sources to generate a certain percentage of power. Furthermore, many state and local leaders have\nintensified or stated their intent to intensify efforts to support international climate commitments and treaties.\nThe extent of future regulation of GHG emissions may inhibit utilities from investing in the building of new\ncoal-fired plants to replace older plants or investing in the upgrading of existing coal-fired plants. Any reduction in the\namount of coal consumed by electric power generators as a result of actual or potential regulation of GHG emissions\ncould decrease demand for thermal coal, thereby reducing our revenue and adversely affecting our business and results\nof operations. We or our prospective customers may also have to invest in carbon dioxide capture and storage\ntechnologies in order to burn coal and comply with future GHG emission standards.\nFinally, there have been attempts to encourage the reduction of coalbed methane emissions because methane\nhas a greater GHG effect than carbon dioxide and can give rise to safety concerns. For example, the EPA has established\nthe Coalbed Methane Outreach Program in an effort to mitigate methane emissions from underground coal mines\nthrough voluntary initiatives and outreach in partnership with the coal industry. If new laws or regulations were\nintroduced to reduce coalbed methane emissions, those rules could adversely affect our costs of operations by requiring\ninstallation of air pollution controls, higher taxes, or costs incurred to purchase credits that permit us to continue\noperations.\n17\nTable of Contents\nClean Water Act. The CWA and corresponding state laws and regulations affect coal mining operations by\nrestricting the discharge of pollutants, including dredged or fill materials, into waters of the United States. Likewise,\npermits are required under the CWA to construct impoundments, fills or other structure in areas that are designated as\nwaters of the United States. For example, prior to placing fill material in waters of the United States, such as with the\nconstruction of a valley fill, coal mining companies are required to obtain a permit from the Corps under Section 404 of\nthe CWA. The permit can be either a Nationwide Permit (“NWP”), normally NWP 21, 49 or 50 for coal mining\nactivities, or a more complicated individual permit. NWPs are designed to allow for an expedited permitting process,\nwhile individual permits involve a longer and more detailed review process. The EPA has the authority to veto permits\nissued by the Corps under the CWA’s Section 404 program that prohibits the discharge of dredged or fill material into\nregulated waters without a permit. Additionally, recent court decisions, regulatory actions and proposed legislation have\ncreated uncertainty over CWA jurisdiction and permitting requirements, such as (1) an April 2020 decision further\ndefining the scope of the CWA, wherein the U.S. Supreme Court held that, in certain cases, discharges from a point\nsource to groundwater could fall within the scope of the CWA and require a permit and (2) a May 2023 decision further\ndefining the scope of the CWA, wherein the U.S. Supreme Court held that discharges from a point source to a wetland\ncould fall within the scope of the CWA and require a permit if the adjacent body of water is a relatively permanent body\nof water connected to traditional interstate navigable waters and the wetland has a continuous surface connection with\nthat water.\nPrior to discharging any pollutants into waters of the United States, coal mining companies must obtain a\nNational Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permit from the appropriate state or federal permitting\nauthority. NPDES permits include effluent limitations for discharged pollutants and other terms and conditions,\nincluding required monitoring of discharges. Failure to comply with the CWA or NPDES permits can lead to the\nimposition of significant penalties, litigation, compliance costs and delays in coal production. Potential changes in state\nand federally recommended water quality standards may result in the issuance or modification of permits with new or\nmore stringent effluent limits or terms and conditions. For instance, waters designated by states as impaired (i.e., as not\nmeeting current water quality standards) are subject to Total Maximum Daily Load (“TMDL”) regulations, which may\nlead to the adoption of more stringent discharge standards for our coal mines and could require more costly treatment.\nLikewise, the water quality of certain receiving streams requires an anti-degradation review before approving any\ndischarge permits. TMDL regulations and anti-degradation policies may increase the cost, time and difficulty associated\nwith obtaining and complying with NPDES permits. In addition, in certain circumstances private citizens may challenge\nalleged violations of NPDES permit limits in court. Recently, certain citizen groups have filed lawsuits alleging ongoing\ndischarges of pollutants, including selenium and conductance, from valley fills located at certain mining sites in some of\nthe regions where we operate. In West Virginia, several of these cases have been successful for the challengers. While it\nis difficult to predict the outcome of any potential or future suits, such litigation could result in increased compliance\ncosts following the completion of mining at our operations.\nFinally, in June 2015, the EPA and the Corps published a new definition of “waters of the United States”\n(“WOTUS”) that would have expanded areas requiring NPDES or Corps Section 404 permits. This definition never took\neffect as it was replaced by the Navigable Waters Protection Rule (the “NWPR”) in December 2019. A coalition of\nstates and cities, environmental groups and agricultural groups challenged the NWPR, which was vacated by the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the District of Arizona in August 2021. In December 2022, the EPA and Corps announced the final\n“Revised Definition of ‘Waters of the United States’” rule. This rule is not currently operative in certain states and for\ncertain parties due to ongoing litigation. In August 2023, the EPA and Corps issued a final rule to amend the “Revised\nDefinition of ‘Waters of the United States’” rule in response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s May 2023 decision in the case\nof Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency. In the jurisdictions and for the parties where the January 2023 rule is\nenjoined, the EPA and Corps are interpreting “waters of the United States” consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Sackett and the pre-2015 regulatory regime. To the extent a new rule or further litigation expands the scope\nof the CWA’s jurisdiction, the CWA permits we need may not be issued, may not be issued in a timely fashion, or may\nbe issued with new requirements which restrict our ability to conduct mining operations or to do so profitably.\nResource Conservation and Recovery Act. The RCRA and corresponding state laws establish standards for the\nmanagement of solid and hazardous wastes generated at our various facilities. Besides affecting current waste disposal\npractices, the RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past hazardous waste treatment, storage and\n18\nTable of Contents\ndisposal practices. In addition, the RCRA requires certain of our facilities to evaluate and respond to any past release, or\nthreatened release, of a hazardous substance that may pose a risk to human health or the environment.\nThe RCRA may affect coal mining operations by establishing requirements for the proper management,\nhandling, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. For example, the EPA regulates coal ash as a solid\nwaste under Subtitle D of the RCRA through its coal combustion residuals (“CCR”) rule. This rule establishes limits for\nthe location of new sites and requires closure of sites that fail to meet prescribed engineering standards, regular\ninspections of impoundments, and immediate remediation and closure of unlined ponds that are polluting ground water.\nAs initially promulgated, the rule exempted closed coal ash impoundments located at inactive facilities and allowed for\nthe continued operation of unlined or clay-lined ponds that were not polluting groundwater. Additionally, in\nDecember 2016, Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act, which provided for the\nestablishment of state and EPA permit programs for the control of CCR and authorizes states to incorporate the EPA’s\nfinal rule for CCR or develop other criteria that are at least as protective as the final rule. In May 2023, the EPA\npublished proposed changes to the CCR rule for legacy CCR surface impoundments and a notice of data availability\nrelated to the proposed rule in November 2023. The finalization of this proposal, the current requirements of the CCR\nrules, as well as any future changes in the management of CCR, could increase our customers’ operating costs and\npotentially reduce their ability or need to purchase coal. In addition, contamination caused by the past disposal of CCR,\nincluding coal ash, could lead to material liability for our customers under the RCRA or other federal or state laws and\npotentially further reduce the demand for coal.\nCurrently, certain coal mine wastes, such as earth and rock covering a mineral deposit (commonly referred to as\noverburden) and coal cleaning wastes, are exempted from hazardous waste management under the RCRA. Any change\nor reclassification of this exemption could significantly increase our coal mining costs.\nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. CERCLA and similar state laws\naffect coal mining operations by, among other things, imposing cleanup requirements for threatened or actual releases of\nhazardous substances into the environment. Under CERCLA and similar state laws, joint and several liability may be\nimposed on hazardous substance generators, site owners, transporters, lessees and others regardless of fault or the\nlegality of the original disposal activity. Although the EPA excludes most wastes generated by coal mining and\nprocessing operations from the primary hazardous waste laws, such wastes can, in certain circumstances, constitute\nhazardous substances for the purposes of CERCLA. In addition, the disposal, release or spilling of some products used\nby coal companies in operations, such as chemicals listed as hazardous substances under CERCLA, could trigger the\nliability provisions of CERCLA or similar state laws. The EPA periodically evaluates the CERCLA list of hazardous\nsubstances. In September 2022, the EPA proposed to designate two per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”),\nincluding their salts and structural isomers, as hazardous substances under CERCLA. This proposed rule, if finalized,\nmay result in increased costs to cleanup properties at which the listed PFAS were released.\nWe may be subject to liability under CERCLA and similar state laws for coal mines that we currently own,\nlease or operate or that we or our predecessors have previously owned, leased or operated, and sites to which we or our\npredecessors sent hazardous substances. These liabilities could be significant and materially and adversely impact our\nfinancial results and liquidity.\nEndangered Species and Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Acts. The ESA and similar state legislation protect\nspecies designated as threatened, endangered or other special status. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the “USFWS”)\nworks closely with the OSMRE and state regulatory agencies to ensure that species subject to the ESA are protected\nfrom mining-related impacts. Several species indigenous to the areas in which we operate are protected under the ESA.\nOther species in the vicinity of our operations may have their listing status reviewed in the future and could also become\nprotected under the ESA. In addition, the USFWS has identified bald eagle habitats in some of the counties where we\noperate. The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act prohibits taking certain actions that would harm bald or golden\neagles without obtaining a permit from the USFWS. Compliance with the requirements of the ESA and the Bald and\nGolden Eagle Protection Act could have the effect of prohibiting or delaying us from obtaining mining permits. These\nrequirements may also include restrictions on timber harvesting, road building and other mining or agricultural activities\nin areas containing the affected species or their habitats. There is also increasing interest in nature-related matters\n19\nTable of Contents\nbeyond protected species, such as general biodiversity, which may similarly require us or our customers to incur costs or\ntake measures which may adversely impact our business or operations.\nUse of Explosives. Our surface mining operations are subject to numerous regulations relating to blasting\nactivities. Due to these regulations, we will incur costs to design and implement blast schedules and to conduct pre-blast\nsurveys and blast monitoring. In addition, the storage of explosives is subject to various regulatory requirements. For\nexample, the Department of Homeland Security requires facilities in possession of chemicals of interest (including\nammonium nitrate at certain threshold levels) to complete a screening review. Our mines are low risk, Tier 4 facilities\nwhich are not subject to additional security plans. The adoption of future, more stringent standards related to the use of\nexplosives could materially adversely impact our cost or ability to conduct our mining operations.\nNational Environmental Policy Act. The National Environmental Policy Act (the “NEPA”) requires federal\nagencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly\nimpact the environment, such as issuing a permit or other approval. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will\ntypically prepare an environmental assessment to determine the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a\nproposed project. Where the activities in question have significant impacts to the environment, the agency must prepare\nan environmental impact statement. Compliance with the NEPA can be time-consuming and may result in the imposition\nof mitigation measures that could affect the amount of coal that we are able to produce from mines on federal lands, and\nmay require public comment. Furthermore, whether agencies have complied with the NEPA is subject to protest, appeal\nor litigation, which can delay or halt projects. The NEPA review process, including potential disputes regarding the level\nof evaluation required for climate change impacts, may extend the time and/or increase the costs and difficulty of\nobtaining necessary governmental approvals, and may lead to litigation regarding the adequacy of the NEPA analysis,\nwhich could delay or potentially preclude the issuance of approvals or grant of leases.\nOn July 16, 2020, the Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) revised NEPA’s implementing regulations to\nmake the NEPA process more efficient, effective, and timely. The rule required federal agencies to develop procedures\nconsistent with the new rule within one year of the rule’s effective date (which was extended to two years in June 2021).\nThese regulations are subject to ongoing litigation in several federal district courts, and in October 2021, CEQ issued a\nnotice of proposed rulemaking to amend the NEPA regulatory changes adopted in 2020 in two phases. Phase I of CEQ’s\nproposed rulemaking process was finalized on April 20, 2022 and generally restored provisions that were in effect prior\nto 2020. Phase II of the proposed rulemaking was published by CEQ in July 2023. Phase II proposes further revisions in\nan attempt to ensure the NEPA process “provides for efficient and effective environmental reviews,” and meets\nenvironmental, environmental justice, and climate change objectives. These rules could create additional delays and\ncosts in the NEPA review process or in our operations, or even an inability to obtain necessary federal approvals for our\noperations due to the increased risk of legal challenges from environmental groups seeking additional analysis of climate\nimpacts.\nOther Environmental Laws. We are required to comply with numerous other federal, state, and local\nenvironmental laws and regulations in addition to those previously discussed. These additional laws include but are not\nlimited to the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Emergency Planning and Community\nRight-to-Know Act and similar state laws. Each of these laws can impact permitting or planned operations and can result\nin additional costs or operational delays.\nSeasonality\nOur primary business is not materially impacted by seasonal fluctuations. Demand for metallurgical coal is\ngenerally more heavily influenced by other factors such as the general economy, interest rates and commodity prices.\nHuman Capital Resources\nWe believe our employees are a competitive advantage. We seek to foster a culture that supports diversity,\nequity and inclusion, and strive to provide a safe, healthy and rewarding work environment with opportunities for\ngrowth. We had 811 employees as of December 31, 2023, including our named executive officers, and nearly all of our\nemployees are full-time employees. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we\n20\nTable of Contents\nhave not experienced any strikes or work stoppages related to labor relation issues. We believe we have good relations\nwith our employees. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, training,\nretaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. We also depend on experienced\ncontractors and third-party consultants to conduct some of our day-to-day activities. We plan to continue to use the\nservices of many of these contractors and consultants.\nSafety Philosophy. We have a comprehensive health and safety program based on the core belief that all\naccidents and occupational illnesses are preventable. We believe that:\n• Business excellence is achieved through the pursuit of safer and more productive work practices.\n• Any task that cannot be performed safely should not be performed.\n• Working safely is a requirement of our employees.\n• Controlling the work environment is important, but human behavior within the work environment is\nparamount.\n• Safety starts with individual decision-making—all employees must assume a share of responsibility for acts\nwithin their control that pose a risk of injury to themselves or fellow workers.\n• All levels of the organization must be proactive in implementing safety processes that promote a safe and\nhealthy work environment.\n• Consequently, we are committed to providing a safe work environment; providing our employees with\nproper training and equipment; and implementing safety and health rules, policies and programs that foster\nsafety excellence.\nOur safety program includes a focus on the following:\n• Hiring the Right Workers. Our hiring program includes significant pre-employment screening and\nreference checks.\n• Safety Incentives. We have a compensation system that encourages and rewards excellent safety\nperformance.\n• Communication. We conduct regular safety meetings with the frequent involvement of senior management\nto reinforce the “tone at the top.”\n• Drug and Alcohol Testing. We require pre-employment drug screening as well as regular random drug\ntesting that exceeds regulatory requirements.\n• Continuous Improvement Programs. We track key safety performance metrics, including accident rates,\nviolation types and frequencies. We have specific targets in these areas, and we measure performance\nagainst these targets. Specific action plans are implemented for targeted improvement in areas where\nperformance falls below our expectations.\n• Training. Our training program includes comprehensive new employee orientation and training, annual\nrefresher training and task training components. These training modules are designed to reinforce our high\nsafety expectations. Work rules and procedures are a key element of this training.\n• Accident Investigation. We have a structured accident investigation procedure that identifies root causes of\naccidents as well as actions necessary to prevent reoccurrence. We focus on near misses and close calls as a\nmeans of attempting to prevent more serious accidents from occurring.\n• Safety Audits. We conduct periodic safety audits that include workplace examinations, including\nobservation of workers at work, as well as safety program reviews. Both internal and external resources are\nutilized to conduct these audits.\n• Employee Performance Improvement. A key element of our safety program is the recognition that safe\nwork practices are a requirement of employment. We identify employee performance which is below\nexpectations and develop specific action plans for improvement.\n• Employee Involvement. The key to excellent safety is employee involvement and engagement. We foster\ndirect employee involvement in a number of ways including audit participation, accident investigations, as\ntraining resources and through solicitation of ideas in small group meetings and through anonymous\nworkplace observation suggestion boxes.\n21\nTable of Contents\n• Positive Reinforcement. Establishing safety as a core belief is paramount to our safety performance. As a\nresult, we look for opportunities to celebrate accomplishments and to build pride in our operational safety\nand performance.\nAvailable Information\nOur investor relations website is ir.ramacoresources.com and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily\nfinding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or\nfurnish with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), corporate governance information (including our Code\nof Conduct and Ethics) and press releases. Our filings with the SEC are also available to the public from commercial\ndocument retrieval services and at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business involves certain risks and uncertainties. The following is a description of significant risks that\nmight cause our future financial condition or results of operations to differ materially from those expected. In addition to\nthe risks and uncertainties described below, we may face other risks and uncertainties, some of which may be unknown\nto us and some of which we may deem immaterial. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, our business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. A summary of our risk factors is as\nfollows:\nRisks Related to Our Business\n• Our properties have not yet been fully developed into producing coal mines and, if we experience any\ndevelopment delays or cost increases or are unable to complete the construction of our facilities, our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n• We have customer concentration, so the loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest\ncoal customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash\nflows.\n• Our customer base is highly dependent on the steel industry.\n• Deterioration in the global economic conditions, a worldwide financial downturn or negative credit\nmarket conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends.\n• Our operations may be disrupted, and our financial results may be adversely affected, by global\noutbreaks of contagious diseases, including COVID-19.\n• We do not enter into long-term sales contracts for our coal and as a result we are exposed to\nfluctuations in market pricing.\n• We face uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable coal reserves, and inaccuracies in\nour estimates could result in lower-than-expected revenues, higher than expected costs and decreased\nprofitability.\n• A substantial or extended decline in the prices we receive for our coal could adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our\nstockholders.\n• Changes in the global economic environment, inflation, rising interest rates, recessions or prolonged\nperiods of slow economic growth, and global instability and actual and threatened geopolitical conflict,\ncould have an adverse effect on our industry and business, as well as those of our customers and\nsuppliers.\n• Increased competition or a loss of our competitive position could adversely affect sales of, or prices\nfor, our coal, which could impair our profitability.\n• The availability and reliability of transportation facilities and fluctuations in transportation costs could\naffect the demand for our coal or impair our ability to supply coal to prospective customers.\n22\nTable of Contents\n• Any significant downtime of our major pieces of mining equipment, including any preparation plants,\ncould impair our ability to supply coal to prospective customers and materially and adversely affect\nour results of operations.\n• Our ability to collect payments from customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness declines or\nif they fail to honor their contracts with us.\n• If we are unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, we may have to curtail our\noperations and delay our construction and growth plans, which may materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our\nstockholders.\n• Our operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain required financial assurance, or if\nthe costs of financial assurance increase materially.\n• Defects in title or loss of any leasehold interests in our properties could limit our ability to conduct\nmining operations on these properties or result in significant unanticipated costs.\n• Substantially all of our mining properties are leased from our affiliates and conflicts of interest may\narise in the future as a result.\n• We may face restricted access to international markets in the future.\n• Our lessees could satisfy obligations to their customers with minerals from properties other than ours,\ndepriving us of the ability to receive amounts in excess of minimum royalty payments.\n• Technology development involves significant time and expense and can be uncertain.\nRisks Related to Environmental, Health, Safety and Other Regulations\n• The current U.S. administration and Congress could enact legislative and regulatory measures that\ncould adversely affect our mining operations or cost structure or our customers’ ability to use coal,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n• Current and future government laws, regulations and other legal requirements relating to protection of\nthe environment and natural resources may increase our costs of doing business and may restrict our\ncoal operations.\n• Our operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, and our\nproperties may have environmental contamination, which could expose us to significant costs and\nliabilities.\n• We must obtain, maintain, and renew governmental permits and approvals for mining operations,\nwhich can be a costly and time-consuming process and result in restrictions on our operations.\n• We and our significant stockholders are subject to the Applicant Violator System.\n• Our mines are subject to stringent federal and state safety regulations that increase our cost of doing\nbusiness at active operations and may place restrictions on our methods of operation. In addition,\ngovernment inspectors in certain circumstances may have the ability to order our operations to be shut\ndown based on safety considerations.\n• We have reclamation, mine closing, and related environmental obligations under the SMCRA. If the\nassumptions underlying our accruals are inaccurate, we could be required to expend greater amounts\nthan anticipated.\nRisks Related to Our Company\n• Our ability to pay dividends may be limited by the amount of cash we generate from operations\nfollowing the payment of fees and expenses, by restrictions of any future debt instruments and by\nadditional factors unrelated to our profitability.\n• Your percentage of ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\n• Certain of our directors have significant duties with, and spend significant time serving, entities that\nmay compete with us in seeking acquisitions and business opportunities and, accordingly, may have\nconflicts of interest in allocating time or pursuing business opportunities.\nRisks Related to Our Class B Common Stock Structure\n23\nTable of Contents\n• Holders of Class B common stock are common stockholders of the Company and, therefore, are\nsubject to risks associated with an investment in the Company as a whole, even if the holder does not\nown shares of Class A common stock.\n• Our Board’s ability to reattribute businesses, assets, and expenses between the Class A common stock\nand Class B common stock may make it difficult to assess the future prospects of a class of common\nstock based on past performance.\n• Dividends on our Class B common stock are discretionary and may fluctuate materially quarter to\nquarter. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to pay dividends in the future or what the actual\ndividends will be for any future periods.\n• The market value of the Class B common stock could be adversely affected by events involving the\nother assets and businesses of the Company.\n• Our new tracking stock capital structure could create conflicts of interest, and our Board may make\ndecisions that could adversely affect only the holders of one class of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur properties have not yet been fully developed into producing coal mines and, if we experience any development\ndelays or cost increases or are unable to complete the construction of our facilities, our business, financial condition\nand results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have not completed development plans for all of our coal properties, and do not expect to have full annual\nproduction from all of our properties until market conditions permit us to resume and complete these development plans.\nWe expect to incur significant capital expenditures until we have completed the development of our properties. In\naddition, the development of our properties involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal\nuncertainties that are beyond our control and that may cause delays in, or increase the costs associated with, their\ncompletion. Accordingly, we may not be able to complete the development of the properties on schedule, at the budgeted\ncost or at all, and any delays beyond the expected development periods or increased costs above those expected to be\nincurred could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and\nability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nIf we are unable to complete or are substantially delayed in completing the development of any of our\nproperties, our business, financial condition, results of operations cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our\nstockholders could be adversely affected.\nWe have customer concentration, so the loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest coal customers\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with an increasingly concentrated customer base both domestically and\nglobally.\nThere are inherent risks whenever a significant percentage of total revenues are concentrated with a limited\nnumber of customers. Revenues from our largest customers may fluctuate from time to time based on numerous factors,\nincluding market conditions, which may be outside of our control. If any of our largest customers experience declining\nrevenues due to market, economic or competitive conditions, we could be pressured to reduce the prices that we charge\nfor our coal, which could have an adverse effect on our margins, profitability, cash flows and financial position. If any\ncustomers were to significantly reduce their purchases of coal from us, including by failing to buy and pay for coal they\ncommitted to purchase in sales contracts, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability\nto pay dividends to our stockholders could be adversely affected.\nSee Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2—Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies—Concentrations” for additional information.\n24\nTable of Contents\nOur customer base is highly dependent on the steel industry.\nSubstantially all of the metallurgical coal that we produce is sold to steel producers. Therefore, demand for our\nmetallurgical coal is highly correlated to the steel industry. The steel industry’s demand for metallurgical coal is affected\nby a number of factors including the cyclical nature of that industry’s business, technological developments in the steel-\nmaking process and the availability of substitutes for steel such as aluminum, composites and plastics. A significant\nreduction in the demand for steel products would reduce the demand for metallurgical coal, which would have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Similarly, if less expensive\ningredients could be used in substitution for metallurgical coal in the integrated steel mill process, the demand for\nmetallurgical coal would materially decrease, which would also materially adversely affect demand for our metallurgical\ncoal. Our export customers, excluding Canada, include foreign steel producers who may be affected by the tariffs to the\nextent their production is imported into the U.S. Retaliatory threats by foreign nations to these tariffs may limit\ninternational trade and adversely impact global economic conditions.\nDeterioration in the global economic conditions in any of the industries in which prospective customers operate, a\nworldwide financial downturn or negative credit market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nEconomic conditions in the industries in which most of our prospective customers operate, such as steelmaking\nand electric power generation, substantially deteriorated in recent years and reduced the demand for coal. A deterioration\nof economic conditions in our prospective customers’ industries could cause a decline in demand for and production of\nmetallurgical coal. Renewed or continued weakness in the economic conditions of any of the industries served by\nprospective customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,\ncash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nOur operations may be disrupted, and our financial results may be adversely affected, by global outbreaks of\ncontagious diseases, including COVID-19.\nGlobal outbreaks of contagious diseases, including the December 2019 outbreak of a strain of coronavirus\n(“COVID-19”), have the potential to significantly and adversely impact our operations and business. On March 11,\n2020, the World Health Organization recognized COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Pandemics or disease outbreaks such\nas the COVID-19 outbreak may have a variety of adverse effects on our business, including by depressing commodity\nprices and the market value of our securities and limiting the ability of our management to meet with potential financing\nsources. Like other coal companies, our business was adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and measures that\nwere taken to mitigate its impact. The pandemic resulted in widespread adverse impacts on our employees, customers,\nsuppliers and other parties with whom we have business relations. The spread of COVID-19 had a negative impact on\nthe financial markets, which may impact our ability to obtain additional financing. A prolonged downturn in the\nfinancial markets could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and ability to raise capital.\nWe cannot predict the full impact that future global outbreaks of contagious diseases, including COVID-19,\nwill have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations at this time, due to\nnumerous uncertainties. The ultimate impacts will depend on future developments, including, among others, the\nconsequences of governmental and other measures designed to slow the spread of such diseases, the development of\neffective treatments, the duration of the outbreaks, actions taken by governmental authorities, customers, suppliers and\nother third parties, workforce availability, and the timing and extent to which normal economic and operating conditions\nresume.\nWe do not enter into long-term sales contracts for our coal and as a result we are exposed to fluctuations in market\npricing.\nSales commitments in the metallurgical coal market are typically not long-term in nature and are generally no\nlonger than one year in duration. Most metallurgical coal transactions in the U.S. are done on a calendar year basis,\nwhere both prices and volumes are fixed in the third and fourth quarter for the following calendar year. Globally the\nmarket is evolving to shorter term pricing. Some annual contracts have shifted to quarterly contracts and most volumes\n25\nTable of Contents\nare being sold on an indexed basis, where prices are determined by averaging the leading spot indexes reported in the\nmarket and adjusting for quality. As a result, we are subject to fluctuations in market pricing. We are not protected from\noversupply or market conditions where we cannot sell our coal at economic prices. Metallurgical coal has been an\nextremely volatile commodity over the past ten years and prices are likely to be volatile in the future. There can be no\nassurances we will be able to mitigate such conditions as they arise. Any sustained failure to be able to market our coal\nduring such periods would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash\nflows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nThe failure to access coal preparation facilities may have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce coal for\nour prospective customers and to meet quality specifications.\nThe costs of establishing the infrastructure necessary to enable us to continue to ramp up our mining operations\nwill be significant. We have constructed preparation and loading facilities at our Elk Creek Complex and have recently\nundertaken expansion projects to increase the rates of processing and preparation. Our Berwind Complex will remain\nunder development until we reach our full targeted annual coal production. Some of the Berwind coal will continue to be\nwashed at our active Knox Creek plant until our Berwind plant is fully up and running. We also endeavor to purchase,\nrelocate, and reassemble preparation plant assets at our Maben complex for future use. Our failure to provide the\nnecessary preparation, processing and loading facilities for our projects would have a material adverse effect on our\noperations.\nThe risks associated with the construction and operation of mines, processing plants and related infrastructure\ninclude:\n• the potential lack of availability or cost of skilled and unskilled labor, equipment and principal supplies\nneeded for construction of facilities;\n• the need to obtain necessary environmental and other governmental approvals and permits and the\ntiming of the receipt of those approvals and permits;\n• industrial accidents;\n• geologic mine failures, surface facility construction failures or mining, coal processing or transport\nequipment failures;\n• structural failure of an impoundment or refuse area;\n• natural phenomena such as inclement weather conditions, floods, droughts, rockslides and seismic\nactivity;\n• unusual or unexpected geological and coal quality conditions;\n• potential opposition from non-governmental organizations, environmental groups or other activists,\nwhich may delay or prevent development activities; and\n• restrictions or regulations imposed by governmental or regulatory authorities.\nThe costs, timing and complexities of developing our projects may be greater than anticipated. Cost estimates\nmay increase significantly as more detailed engineering work is completed on a project. It is common in mining\noperations to experience unexpected costs, problems and delays during construction, development and mine start-up.\nProduct alternatives or other technologies may reduce demand for our products.\nSubstantially all of our coal production is comprised of metallurgical coal, which commands a significant price\npremium over the majority of other forms of coal because of its use in blast furnaces for steel production. Metallurgical\ncoal has specific physical and chemical properties, which are necessary for efficient blast furnace operation. Steel\nproducers are continually investigating alternative steel production technologies with a view to reducing production\ncosts. The steel industry has increased utilization of electric arc furnaces or pulverized coal injection processes, which\nreduce or eliminate the use of furnace coke, an intermediate product produced from metallurgical coal and, in turn,\ngenerally decreases the demand for metallurgical coal. Many alternative technologies are designed to use lower quality\ncoals or other sources of carbon instead of higher cost high-quality metallurgical coal. While conventional blast furnace\ntechnology has been the most economic large-scale steel production technology for a number of years, and emergent\ntechnologies typically take many years to commercialize, there can be no assurance that over the longer term\n26\nTable of Contents\ncompetitive technologies not reliant on metallurgical coal would not emerge, which could reduce the demand and price\npremiums for metallurgical coal.\nMoreover, we may produce and market other coal products, such as thermal coal, which are also subject to\nalternative competition. Alternative technologies are continually being investigated and developed in order to reduce\nproduction costs or minimize environmental or social impact. In particular, alternatives with lower carbon footprints than\nour products are currently being researched and developed, as our customers are subject to increasing market and/or\nregulatory pressure to reduce their impacts on climate change. Further, the development and use of emerging\ntechnologies in the generation, transmission, storage and consumption of energy, including renewable energy, battery\nstorage, and energy efficiency technologies, may increase the availability of alternative energy sources or lower demand\nfor coal, resulting in lower prices and revenues. If competitive technologies emerge that use other materials in place of or\notherwise eliminate the need for our products, demand and price for our products might fall.\nWe face uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable coal reserves, and inaccuracies in our estimates\ncould result in lower-than-expected revenues, higher than expected costs and decreased profitability.\nCoal is economically recoverable when the price at which coal can be sold exceeds the costs and expenses of\nmining and selling the coal. Any forecasts of our future performance are based on, among other things, estimates of our\nrecoverable coal reserves. We base our reserve information on geologic data, coal ownership information and current\nand proposed mine plans. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of coal and\ncosts to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control. As a result, estimates of economically\nrecoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain. Some of the factors and assumptions that can impact\neconomically recoverable coal reserve estimates include:\n• geologic and mining conditions;\n• historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas;\n• the assumed effects of environmental and other regulations and taxes by governmental agencies;\n• our ability to obtain, maintain and renew all required permits;\n• future improvements in mining technology;\n• assumptions related to future prices; and\n• future operating costs, including the cost of materials, and capital expenditures.\nEach of the factors that impacts reserve estimation may vary considerably from the assumptions used in\nestimating the reserves. For these reasons, estimates of coal reserves may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues\nand expenditures with respect to our future coal reserves may vary from estimates, and these variances may be material.\nAs a result, our estimates may not accurately reflect our actual future coal reserves.\nOur inability to acquire additional coal reserves that are economically recoverable may have a material adverse effect\non our future profitability.\nOur profitability depends substantially on our ability to mine, in a cost-effective manner, coal reserves that\npossess the quality characteristics that prospective customers desire. Because our reserves will decline as we mine our\ncoal, our future profitability depends upon our ability to acquire additional coal reserves that are economically\nrecoverable to replace the reserves we will produce. If we fail to acquire or develop sufficient additional reserves over\nthe long term to replace the reserves depleted by our production, our existing reserves could eventually be exhausted.\nWe are dependent on contractors for the successful completion of the development of our properties.\nWe regularly use contractors in the development of our mines. Timely and cost-effective completion of the\ndevelopment of our properties, including necessary facilities and infrastructure, in compliance with agreed specifications\nis central to our business strategy and is highly dependent on the performance of our contractors under the agreements\nwith them.\n27\nTable of Contents\nAlthough some agreements may provide for liquidated damages, if the contractor fails to perform in the manner\nrequired with respect to certain of its obligations, the events that trigger a requirement to pay liquidated damages may\ndelay or impair the operation of our properties, and any liquidated damages that we receive may not be sufficient to\ncover the damages that we suffer as a result of any such delay or impairment. Further, we may have disagreements with\nour contractors about different elements of the construction process, which could lead to the assertion of rights and\nremedies under their contracts and increase the costs associated with development of the properties or result in a\ncontractor’s unwillingness to perform further work. If any contractor is unable or unwilling to perform according to the\nnegotiated terms and timetable of its respective agreement for any reason or terminates its agreement, we would be\nrequired to engage a substitute contractor. This would likely result in significant project delays and increased costs,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and\nability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nPrices for coal are volatile and can fluctuate widely based upon a number of factors beyond our control, including\noversupply relative to the demand available for our coal and weather. A substantial or extended decline in the prices\nwe receive for our coal could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and\nability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nOur financial results are significantly affected by the prices we receive for our coal and depend, in part, on the\nmargins that we earn on sales of our coal. Our margins will reflect the price we receive for our coal over our cost of\nproducing and transporting our coal. Prices and quantities under U.S. domestic metallurgical coal sales contracts are\ngenerally based on expectations of the next year’s coal prices at the time the contract is entered into, renewed, extended\nor re-opened. Pricing in the global seaborne market is moving towards shorter term pricing models, typically using\nindexes. The expectation of future prices for coal depends upon many factors beyond our control, including the\nfollowing:\n• the market price for coal;\n• overall domestic and global economic conditions, including the supply of and demand for domestic\nand foreign coal, coke and steel;\n• the consumption pattern of industrial consumers, electricity generators and residential users;\n• weather conditions in our markets that affect the demand for thermal coal or that affect the ability to\nproduce metallurgical coal;\n• competition from other coal suppliers;\n• technological advances affecting energy consumption;\n• the costs, availability and capacity of transportation infrastructure;\n• the impact of domestic and foreign governmental laws and regulations, including environmental and\nclimate change regulations and regulations affecting the coal mining industry, and delays in the receipt\nof, failure to receive, failure to maintain or revocation of necessary governmental permits; and\n• increased utilization by the steel industry of electric arc furnaces or pulverized coal injection\nprocesses, which reduce or eliminate the use of furnace coke, an intermediate product produced from\nmetallurgical coal, and generally decrease the demand for metallurgical coal.\nMetallurgical coal is an extremely volatile commodity. There are no assurances that supplies will remain low,\nthat demand will not decrease or that overcapacity may resume, which could cause declines in the prices of and demand\nfor coal, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash\nflows.\nChanges in the global economic environment, inflation, rising interest rates, recessions or prolonged periods of slow\neconomic growth, and global instability and actual and threatened geopolitical conflict, could have an adverse effect\non our industry and business, as well as those of our customers and suppliers.\nOverall economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, including adverse factors such as inflation, rising interest\nrates, supply chain disruptions and the impacts of the war in Ukraine, significantly impact our business. Periods of\neconomic downturn or continued uncertainty could result in difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or\n28\nTable of Contents\nprofitability and we may experience an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash\nflows.\nOur operations are subject to economic conditions, including credit and capital market conditions, inflation,\nprevailing interest rates, and political factors, which if changed could negatively affect our results of operations, cash\nflows and liquidity. Political factors include, but are not limited to, changes to tax laws and regulations resulting in\nincreased income tax liability, increased regulation, such as carbon emissions limitations or trading mechanisms,\nlimitations on exports of energy and raw materials, and trade remedies. Actions taken by the U.S. government could\naffect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine has had a broad range of adverse impacts on global economic conditions, some of\nwhich have had and are likely to continue to have adverse impacts on our business, including increased raw material and\nenergy costs, softer customer demand and lower steel prices.\nAdditionally, we are also exposed to risks associated with the business success and creditworthiness of our\nsuppliers and customers. If our customers or suppliers are negatively impacted by a slowdown in economic markets, we\nmay face the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials,\nand increased risk of insolvency and other credit related issues of customers or suppliers, which could delay payments\nfrom customers, result in increased customer defaults and cause our suppliers to delay filling, or to be unable to fill, our\nneeds at all or on a timely or cost-effective basis. The occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIncreased competition or a loss of our competitive position could adversely affect sales of, or prices for, our coal,\nwhich could impair our profitability. In addition, foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect the\ncompetitiveness of our coal abroad.\nWe compete with other producers primarily on the basis of coal quality, delivered costs to the customer and\nreliability of supply. We compete primarily with U.S. coal producers and with some Canadian coal producers for sales of\nmetallurgical coal to domestic steel producers and, to a lesser extent, thermal coal to electric power generators. We also\ncompete with both domestic and foreign coal producers for sales of metallurgical coal in international markets. Certain\nof these coal producers may have greater financial resources and larger reserve bases than we do. We sell coal to the\nseaborne metallurgical coal market, which is significantly affected by international demand and competition.\nWe cannot assure you that competition from other producers will not adversely affect us in the future. The coal\nindustry has experienced significant consolidation in recent years, including consolidation among some of our major\ncompetitors. We cannot assure you that the result of current or further consolidation in the coal industry, or the\nreorganization through bankruptcy of competitors with large legacy liabilities, will not adversely affect us. A number of\nour competitors have idled production over the last several years in light of lower metallurgical coal prices. A\nstabilization or increase in coal prices could encourage existing producers to expand capacity or could encourage new\nproducers to enter the market.\nIn addition, we face competition from foreign producers that sell their coal in the export market. Potential\nchanges to international trade agreements, trade concessions, foreign currency fluctuations or other political and\neconomic arrangements may benefit coal producers operating in countries other than the United States. Additionally,\nNorth American steel producers face competition from foreign steel producers, which could adversely impact the\nfinancial condition and business of our prospective customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete on\nthe basis of price or other factors with companies that in the future may benefit from favorable foreign trade policies or\nother arrangements. Coal is sold internationally in U.S. dollars and, as a result, general economic conditions in foreign\nmarkets and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may provide our foreign competitors with a competitive\nadvantage. If our competitors’ currencies decline against the U.S. dollar or against our prospective foreign customers’\nlocal currencies, those competitors may be able to offer lower prices for coal to prospective customers. Furthermore, if\nthe currencies of our prospective overseas customers were to significantly decline in value in comparison to the U.S.\ndollar, those prospective customers may seek decreased prices for the coal we sell to them. Consequently, currency\n29\nTable of Contents\nfluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal in international markets, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business involves many hazards and operating risks, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance. The\noccurrence of a significant accident or other event that is not fully insured could adversely affect our business, results\nof operations, financial condition and cash flows, and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nOur mining operations, including our preparation and transportation infrastructure, are subject to many hazards\nand operating risks. Underground mining and related processing activities present inherent risks of injury to persons and\ndamage to property and equipment. Our mines are subject to a number of operating risks that could disrupt operations,\ndecrease production and increase the cost of mining for varying lengths of time, thereby adversely affecting our\noperating results. In addition, if coal production declines, we may not be able to produce sufficient amounts of coal to\ndeliver under future sales contracts. Our inability to satisfy contractual obligations could result in prospective customers\ninitiating claims against us. The operating risks that may have a significant impact on our future coal operations include:\n• variations in thickness of seams of coal;\n• adverse geologic conditions, including amounts of rock and other natural materials intruding into the\ncoal seam, that could affect the stability of the roof and the side walls of the mine;\n• environmental hazards;\n• mining and processing equipment failures, structural failures and unexpected maintenance problems;\n• fires or explosions, including as a result of methane, coal, coal dust or other explosive materials, or\nother accidents;\n• unexpected mine accidents, including rock-falls and explosions caused by the ignition of metallurgical\ncoal dust, natural gas or other explosive sources at our mine sites or fires caused by the spontaneous\ncombustion of metallurgical coal or similar mining accidents;\n• inclement or hazardous weather conditions and natural disasters or other force majeure events;\n• seismic activities, ground failures, rock bursts or structural cave-ins or slides;\n• delays in moving our mining equipment;\n• railroad delays or derailments;\n• security breaches or terroristic acts; and\n• other hazards or occurrences that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution and\nsuspension of operations.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial loss to us as a\nresult of claims for:\n• personal injury or loss of life;\n• damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, including our coal properties\nand our coal production or transportation facilities;\n• pollution, contamination and other environmental damage to our properties or the properties of others;\n• potential legal liability and monetary losses;\n• regulatory investigations, actions and penalties;\n• suspension of our operations; and\n• repair and remediation costs.\nAlthough we maintain insurance for a number of risks and hazards, we may not be insured or fully insured, and\nwe may not be able to recover under our insurance policies, against the losses or liabilities that could arise from a\nsignificant accident in our future coal operations. We may elect not to obtain insurance for any or all of these risks if we\nbelieve that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution,\ncontamination and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Moreover, a significant mine accident or\nregulatory infraction could potentially cause a mine shutdown. For example, on July 10, 2022, we discovered that a\nmaterial methane ignition at our Berwind mining complex had occurred. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations—Methane Ignition at Berwind Mine” for additional information. The\n30\nTable of Contents\noccurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nIn addition, if any of the foregoing changes, conditions or events occurs and is not determined to be a force\nmajeure event, any resulting failure on our part to deliver coal to the purchaser under contract could result in economic\npenalties, suspension or cancellation of shipments or ultimately termination of the agreement, any of which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends\nto our stockholders.\nOur operations are located in a single geographic region, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in\na single geographic area, including adverse impacts of weaker conditions associated with climate change.\nCurrently, all of our active operations are conducted in a single geographic region in the eastern United States\nin the Appalachian basin. The geographic concentration of our operations may disproportionately expose us to\ndisruptions in our operations if the region experiences severe weather, transportation capacity constraints, constraints on\nthe availability of required equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, natural\ndisasters, pandemics (such as COVID-19) or interruption of transportation or other events that impact the region in\nwhich we operate or its surrounding areas. If any of these factors were to impact the region in which we operate more\nthan other coal producing regions, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be\nadversely affected relative to other mining companies that have a more geographically diversified asset portfolio.\nIn addition, weather conditions associated with climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of\nstorms, droughts and floods and other severe weather events, may impact our operations, personnel, physical assets,\nsupply chain, distribution chain, access to raw materials such as water and the cost or availability of insurance. If any\nsuch effects were to occur in areas where we or our customers operate, they could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and cash flows. Our ability to mitigate the adverse physical impacts of climate change\ndepends in part upon our disaster preparedness and response and business continuity planning.\nThe availability and reliability of transportation facilities and fluctuations in transportation costs could affect the\ndemand for our coal or impair our ability to supply coal to prospective customers.\nTransportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply coal to prospective customers. Any\nsignificant delays, interruptions, or other limitations on the ability to transport our coal, including those similar to the\nrail-related constraints we experienced in 2022, could negatively affect our operations. Delays and interruptions of rail\nservices because of accidents, failure to complete construction of rail infrastructure, infrastructure damage, lack of rail or\nport capacity, weather-related problems, governmental regulation, terrorism, strikes, lockouts, third-party actions or\nother events could impair our ability to supply coal to customers and adversely affect our profitability. In addition,\ntransportation costs represent a significant portion of the delivered cost of coal and, as a result, the cost of delivery is a\ncritical factor in a customer’s purchasing decision. Increases in transportation costs, including increases resulting from\nemission control requirements and fluctuations in the price of locomotive diesel fuel and demurrage, could make our\ncoal less competitive, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nAny significant downtime of our major pieces of mining equipment, including any preparation plants, could impair\nour ability to supply coal to prospective customers and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe depend on several major pieces of mining equipment to produce and transport our coal, including, but not\nlimited to, underground continuous mining units and coal conveying systems, surface mining equipment such as\nhighwall miners, front-end loaders and coal overburden haul trucks, preparation plants and related facilities, conveyors\nand transloading facilities. If any of these pieces of equipment or facilities suffered major damage or were destroyed by\nfire, abnormal wear, flooding, incorrect operation or otherwise, we may be unable to replace or repair them in a timely\nmanner or at a reasonable cost, which would impact our ability to produce and transport coal and materially and\nadversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Moreover, the MSHA and other\nregulatory agencies sometimes make changes with regards to requirements for pieces of equipment. Such changes could\n31\nTable of Contents\ncause delays if manufacturers and suppliers are unable to make the required changes in compliance with mandated\ndeadlines.\nIf either our preparation plants, or train loadout facilities, or those of a third party processing or loading our\ncoal, suffer extended downtime, including from major damage, or is destroyed, our ability to process and deliver coal to\nprospective customers would be materially impacted, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of\noperations, financial condition, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. For example, in late-2018,\nwe experienced a partial structural failure at one of the raw coal storage silos that feeds our Elk Creek plant in West\nVirginia, which idled our Elk Creek preparation plant for approximately one month. We also experienced a methane\nignition at the Berwind No. 1 mine in the third quarter of 2022, which required the mine to be idled until production was\nrestarted in the first quarter of 2023.\nIf customers do not enter into, extend or honor contracts with us, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nCoal mined from our operations is subject to testing by prospective customers for its ability to meet various\nspecifications and to work satisfactorily in their ovens and other facilities prior to entering into contracts for purchase\n(which are typically short-term orders having terms of one year or less). If we are unable to successfully test our coals or\nenter into new contracts for the sale of our coal, our ability to achieve profitability would be materially adversely\naffected. Once we enter into contracts, if a substantial portion of our sales contracts are modified or terminated and we\nare unable to replace the contracts (or if new contracts are priced at lower levels), our results of operations would be\nadversely affected, perhaps materially. In addition, if customers refuse to accept shipments of our coal for which they\nhave a contractual obligation, our revenues could be substantially affected and we may have to reduce production at our\nmines until the customer’s contractual obligations are honored. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the\npayments we receive which could affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our\nstockholders.\nCertain provisions in typical long-term sales contracts provide limited protection during adverse economic conditions,\nwhich may eventually result in economic penalties to us or permit the customer to terminate the contract.\nFurthermore, our ability to collect payments from prospective customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness\ndeclines or if they fail to honor their contracts with us.\nWe do not expect to enter into significant long-term sales contracts, but if we do, price adjustment, “price\nreopener” and other similar provisions typical in long-term sales contracts may reduce protection from short-term coal\nprice volatility traditionally provided by such contracts. Price reopener provisions may be included in our future sales\ncontracts. These price reopener provisions may automatically set a new price based on prevailing market price or, in\nsome instances, require the parties to agree on a new price, sometimes within a specified range of prices. Any adjustment\nor renegotiations leading to a significantly lower contract price could adversely affect our profitability. Some annual\nmetallurgical coal contracts have shifted to quarterly contracts and many include prices determined by averaging the\nleading spot indexes reported in the market, exposing us further to risks related to pricing volatility.\nOur ability to receive payment for coal sold and delivered depends on the continued solvency and\ncreditworthiness of prospective customers. The number of domestic steel producers is small, and they compete globally\nfor steel production. If their business or creditworthiness suffers, we may bear an increased risk with respect to payment\ndefault. Competition with other coal suppliers could force us to extend credit to customers and on terms that could\nincrease the risk we bear with respect to payment default. We could also enter into agreements to supply coal to energy\ntrading and brokering customers under which a customer sells coal to end-users. If the creditworthiness of any\nprospective energy trading and brokering customer declines, we may not be able to collect payment for all coal sold and\ndelivered to or on behalf of this customer.\nIn addition, if customers refuse to accept shipments of our coal that they have a contractual obligation to\npurchase, our revenues will decrease, and we may have to reduce production at our mines until prospective customers’\ncontractual obligations are honored. Our inability to collect payment from counterparties to our sales contracts may\nmaterially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay\ndividends to our stockholders.\n32\nTable of Contents\nWe may be unsuccessful in integrating the operations of any future acquisitions, including acquisitions involving\nnew lines of business, with our existing operations, and in realizing all or any part of the anticipated benefits of any\nsuch acquisitions.\nFrom time to time, we may evaluate and acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing\nassets and business, such as the mineral lease with the McDonald Land Company for coal reserves adjacent to our Elk\nCreek mine complex near Logan, West Virginia. The assets and businesses we acquire may be dissimilar from our initial\nlines of business. Acquisitions may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness. Our\ncapitalization and results of operations may change significantly as a result of future acquisitions. We may also add new\nlines of business to our existing operations.\nFurther, unexpected costs and challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations or\nmanagement are combined, and we may experience unanticipated delays in realizing the benefits of an acquisition. Entry\ninto certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar and may lead to\nincreased litigation and regulatory risk. Also, following an acquisition, we may discover previously unknown liabilities\nassociated with the acquired business or assets for which we have no recourse under applicable indemnification\nprovisions. If an acquired business or new line of business generates insufficient revenue or if we are unable to\nefficiently manage our expanded operations, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nTo maintain and grow our business, we will be required to make substantial capital expenditures. If we are unable to\nobtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, we may have to curtail our operations and delay our\nconstruction and growth plans, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and cash flows, and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nIn order to maintain and grow our business, we will need to make substantial capital expenditures associated\nwith our mines and the construction of coal preparation facilities which have not yet been constructed. Constructing,\nmaintaining, repairing and expanding mines and infrastructure, including coal preparation and loading facilities, is\ncapital intensive. Specifically, the exploration, permitting and development of coal reserves, and the maintenance of\nmachinery, equipment and facilities, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations require substantial capital\nexpenditures. While we funded a significant amount of the capital expenditures needed to build out our mining and\npreparation infrastructure at our Elk Creek property with cash on hand, we must continue to invest capital to maintain or\nto increase our production and to develop any future acquired properties. Decisions to increase our production levels\ncould also affect our capital needs. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our production levels or\ngenerate sufficient cash flow, or that we will have access to sufficient financing to continue our production, exploration,\npermitting and development activities, and we may be required to defer all or a portion of our capital expenditures.\nIf we do not make sufficient or effective capital expenditures, we will be unable to develop and grow our\nbusiness. To fund our projected capital expenditures, we will be required to use cash from our operations, incur debt or\nissue additional common stock or other equity securities. Using cash from our operations will reduce cash available for\nmaintaining or increasing our operating activities and paying dividends to our stockholders. Our ability to obtain bank\nfinancing or our ability to access the capital markets for future equity or debt offerings may be limited by our financial\ncondition at the time of any such financing or offering and the covenants in our future debt agreements, as well as by\ngeneral economic conditions, contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control, such as the COVID-19\npandemic.\nIn addition, incurring debt may significantly increase our interest expense and financial leverage, and issuing\nadditional equity securities may result in significant stockholder dilution.\nWe may not be able to obtain equipment, parts and supplies in a timely manner, in sufficient quantities or at\nreasonable costs to support our coal mining and transportation operations.\nCoal mining consumes large quantities of commodities including steel, copper, rubber products and liquid fuels\nand requires the use of capital equipment. Some commodities, such as steel, are needed to comply with roof control\n33\nTable of Contents\nplans required by regulation. The prices we pay for commodities and capital equipment are strongly impacted by the\nglobal market. A rapid or significant increase in the costs of commodities or capital equipment we use in our operations\ncould impact our mining operations costs because we may have a limited ability to negotiate lower prices and, in some\ncases, may not have a ready substitute.\nWe use equipment in our coal mining and transportation operations such as continuous mining units, conveyors,\nshuttle cars, rail cars, locomotives, and roof bolters. We procure this equipment from a concentrated group of suppliers,\nand obtaining this equipment often involves long lead times. Occasionally, demand for such equipment by mining\ncompanies can be high and some types of equipment may be in short supply. Delays in receiving or shortages of this\nequipment, as well as the raw materials used in the manufacturing of supplies and mining equipment, which, in some\ncases, do not have ready substitutes, or the cancellation of any future supply contracts under which we obtain equipment\nand other consumables, could limit our ability to obtain these supplies or equipment. In addition, if any of our suppliers\nexperiences an adverse event, or decides to no longer do business with us, we may be unable to obtain sufficient\nequipment and raw materials in a timely manner or at a reasonable price to allow us to meet our production goals and\nour revenues may be adversely impacted. We use considerable quantities of steel in the mining process. If the price of\nsteel or other materials increases substantially or if the value of the U.S. dollar declines relative to foreign currencies\nwith respect to certain imported supplies or other products, our operating expenses could increase. Any of the foregoing\nevents could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and\nability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nWe experienced rail-related constraints in 2022, which led to higher coal inventory levels at December 31,\n2022.\nWe are a holding company, and we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us in order to\nsatisfy our financial obligations and to make dividend payments.\nWe are a holding company, and our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own all of our operating\nassets. We have no significant assets other than the equity interests in our subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to pay our\nobligations and to make dividend payments, depends entirely on our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to\nus. The ability of a subsidiary to make these distributions could be affected by a claim or other action by a third-party,\nincluding a creditor, or by the law of their respective jurisdictions of formation which regulates the payment of\ndividends. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries, we may not be able to declare or pay dividends.\nOur operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain required financial assurance, or if the costs of\nfinancial assurance increase materially.\nFederal and state laws require financial assurance to secure our permit obligations including to reclaim lands\nused for mining, to pay federal and state workers’ compensation and black lung benefits, and to satisfy other\nmiscellaneous obligations. The changes in the market for coal used to generate electricity in recent years have led to\nbankruptcies involving prominent coal producers. Several of these companies relied on self-bonding to guarantee their\nresponsibilities under the SMCRA permits including for reclamation. In response to these bankruptcies, the OSMRE\nissued a Policy Advisory in August 2016 to state agencies that was intended to discourage authorized states from\napproving self-bonding arrangements. Although the Policy Advisory was rescinded in October 2017, certain states,\nincluding Virginia, had previously announced that it would no longer accept self-bonding to secure reclamation\nobligations under the state mining laws. Individually and collectively, these and future revised financial assurance\nrequirements may lead to increased demand for other forms of financial assurance, which may strain capacity for those\ninstruments and increase our costs of obtaining and maintaining the amounts of financial assurance needed for our\noperations, which may delay the timing for and increase the costs of obtaining this financial assurance.\nWe use surety bonds, trusts and letters of credit to provide financial assurance for certain transactions and\nbusiness activities. If, in the future, we are unable to secure surety bonds for these obligations and are forced to secure\nletters of credit indefinitely or obtain some other form of financial assurance at too high of a cost, we may not be able to\nobtain permits and production on our properties could be adversely affected. This could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\n34\nTable of Contents\nOur mines are located in areas containing oil and natural gas operations, which may require us to coordinate our\noperations with those of oil and natural gas drillers.\nOur coal reserves are in areas containing developed or undeveloped oil and natural gas deposits and reservoirs,\nincluding the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, and our Virginia reserves are currently the subject of substantial oil and\nnatural gas exploration and production activities, including by horizontal drilling. If we have received a permit for our\nmining activities, then, while we will have to coordinate our mining with such oil and natural gas drillers, our mining\nactivities are expected to have priority over any oil and natural gas drillers with respect to the land covered by our\npermit. For reserves outside of our permits, we expect to engage in discussions with drilling companies on potential\nareas on which they can drill that may have a minimal effect on our mine plan. Depending on priority of interests, our\noperations may have to avoid existing oil and gas wells or expend sums to plug oil and gas wells.\nIf a well is in the path of our mining for coal on land that has not yet been permitted for our mining activities,\nwe may not be able to mine through the well unless we purchase it. The cost of purchasing a producing horizontal or\nvertical well could be substantial. Horizontal wells with multiple laterals extending from the well pad may access larger\noil and natural gas reserves than a vertical well, which would typically result in a higher cost to acquire. The cost\nassociated with purchasing oil and natural gas wells that are in the path of our coal mining activities may make mining\nthrough those wells uneconomical, thereby effectively causing a loss of significant portions of our coal reserves, which\ncould materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to\npay dividends to our stockholders.\nDefects in title or loss of any leasehold interests in our properties could limit our ability to conduct mining operations\non these properties or result in significant unanticipated costs.\nWe conduct a significant part of our mining operations on properties that we lease. A title defect or the loss of\nany lease upon expiration of its term, upon a default or otherwise, could adversely affect our ability to mine the\nassociated reserves and/or process the coal we mine. Title to most of our owned or leased properties and mineral rights is\nnot usually verified until we make a commitment to develop a property, which may not occur until after we have\nobtained necessary permits and completed exploration of the property. In some cases, we rely on title information or\nrepresentations and warranties provided by our lessors or grantors. Our right to mine some of our reserves may be\nadversely affected if defects in title or boundaries exist or if a lease expires. Any challenge to our title or leasehold\ninterests could delay the exploration and development of the property and could ultimately result in the loss of some or\nall of our interest in the property and, accordingly, require us to reduce our estimated coal reserves. Mining operations\nfrom time to time may rely on an expired lease that we are unable to renew. If we were to be in default with respect to\nleases for properties on which we have mining operations, we may have to close down or significantly alter the sequence\nof such mining operations, which may adversely affect our future coal production and future revenues. If we mine on\nproperty that we do not own or lease, we could incur liability for such mining.\nIn any such case, the investigation and resolution of title issues would divert management’s time from our\nbusiness and our results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, if we lose any leasehold interests\nrelating to any preparation plants, we may need to find an alternative location to process our coal and load it for delivery\nto customers, which could result in significant unanticipated costs.\nIn order to obtain leases or mining contracts to conduct our mining operations on property where these defects\nexist, we may in the future have to incur unanticipated costs. In addition, we may not be able to successfully negotiate\nnew leases or mining contracts for properties containing additional reserves or maintain our leasehold interests in\nproperties where we have not commenced mining operations during the term of the lease. Some leases have minimum\nproduction requirements. Failure to meet those requirements could result in losses of prepaid royalties and, in some rare\ncases, could result in a loss of the lease itself.\n35\nTable of Contents\nWhile none of our employees who conduct mining operations are currently members of unions, our business could be\nadversely affected by union activities.\nWe are not subject to any collective bargaining or union agreement with respect to properties we currently\ncontrol. However, it is possible that future employees, or those of our contract miners, who conduct mining operations\nmay join or seek recognition to form a labor union or may be required to become labor agreement signatories. If some or\nall of the employees who conduct mining operations were to become unionized, it could adversely affect productivity,\nincrease labor costs and increase the risk of work stoppages at our mines. If a work stoppage were to occur, it could\ninterfere with operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,\ncash flows and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nA shortage of skilled labor in the mining industry could pose a risk to achieving improved labor productivity, which\ncould adversely affect our profitability.\nEfficient coal mining using modern techniques and equipment requires skilled laborers, preferably with at least\na year of experience and proficiency in multiple mining tasks. The demand for skilled employees sometimes causes a\nsignificant constriction of the labor supply resulting in higher labor costs. When met coal producers compete for skilled\nminers, recruiting challenges can occur and employee turnover rates can increase, which negatively affect operating\nefficiency and costs. In the event there is a shortage of experienced labor, it could have an adverse impact on our labor\nproductivity and our ability to expand production in the event there is an increase in the demand for our coal.\nWe may face restricted access to international markets in the future.\nAccess to international markets may be subject to ongoing interruptions and trade barriers due to policies and\ntariffs of individual countries, and the actions of certain interest groups to restrict the import or export of certain\ncommodities. There can be no assurance that our access to these markets will not be restricted in the future. An inability\nfor U.S. metallurgical coal suppliers to access international markets would likely result in an oversupply of metallurgical\ncoal in the domestic market, resulting in a decrease in prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nWe and our significant stockholders are subject to the Applicant Violator System.\nUnder the SMCRA and its state law counterparts, all coal mining applications must include mandatory\n“ownership and control” information, which generally includes listing the names of our officers and directors, and our\nprincipal stockholders owning 10 percent or more of our voting shares, among others. Ownership and control reporting\nrequirements are designed to allow regulatory review of any entities or persons deemed to have ownership or control of a\ncoal mine, and bars the granting of a coal mining permit to any such entity or person (including any “owner and\ncontroller”) who has had a mining permit revoked or suspended, or a bond or similar security forfeited within the five-\nyear period preceding a permit application or application for a permit revision. Regulatory agencies also block the\nissuance of permits to an applicant who, or whose owner and controller, has permit violations outstanding that have not\nbeen timely abated.\nA federal database, known as the Applicant Violator System, is maintained for this purpose. Certain\nrelationships are presumed to constitute ownership or control, including the following: being an officer or director of an\nentity; being the operator of the coal mining operation; having the ability to commit the financial or real property assets\nor working resources of the permittee or operator; based on the instruments of ownership or the voting securities of a\ncorporate entity, owning of record 10% or more of the mining operator, among others. This presumption, in most cases,\ncan be rebutted where the person or entity can demonstrate that it in fact does not or did not have authority directly or\nindirectly to determine the manner in which the relevant coal mining operation is conducted. An ownership and control\nnotice must be filed by us each time an entity obtains a 10% or greater interest in us. If we have unabated violations of\nthe SMCRA or its state law counterparts, have a coal mining permit suspended or revoked, or forfeit a reclamation bond,\nwe and our “owners and controllers,” as discussed above, may be prohibited from obtaining new coal mining permits, or\namendments to existing permits, until such violations of law are corrected. This is known as being “permit-blocked.”\nAdditionally, Yorktown and Mr. Atkins are each currently deemed an “owner or controller” of a number of other mining\n36\nTable of Contents\ncompanies; as such, we could be permit-blocked based upon the violations of or permit-blocked status of an “owner or\ncontroller” of us. This could adversely affect production from our properties.\nWe may be subject to additional limitations on our ability to conduct mining operations due to federal jurisdiction.\nWe may conduct some underground mining activities on properties that are within the designated boundary of\nfederally protected lands or national forests where the above-mentioned restrictions within the meaning of the SMCRA\ncould apply. Federal court decisions could pose a potential restriction on underground mining within 100 feet of a public\nroad as well as other restrictions. If these SMCRA restrictions ultimately apply to underground mining, considerable\nuncertainty would exist about the nature and extent of this restriction. While it could remain possible to obtain permits\nfor underground mining operations in these areas even where this 100-foot restriction was applied, the time and expense\nof that permitting process would be likely to increase significantly, and the restrictions placed on the mining of those\nproperties could adversely affect our costs.\nOur lessees could satisfy obligations to their customers with minerals from properties other than ours, depriving us of\nthe ability to receive amounts in excess of minimum royalty payments.\nMineral supply contracts generally do not require operators to satisfy their obligations to their customers with\nresources mined from specific locations. Several factors may influence a lessee’s decision to supply its customers with\nminerals mined from properties we do not own or lease, including the royalty rates under the lessee’s lease with us,\nmining conditions, mine operating costs, cost and availability of transportation, and customer specifications. In addition,\nlessees move on and off of our properties over the course of any given year in accordance with their mine plans. If a\nlessee satisfies its obligations to its customers with minerals from properties we do not own or lease, production on our\nproperties will decrease, and we will receive lower royalty revenues.\nA lessee may incorrectly report royalty revenues, which might not be identified by our lessee audit process or our\nmine inspection process or, if identified, might be identified in a subsequent period.\nWe depend on our lessees to correctly report production and royalty revenues on a monthly basis. Our regular\nlessee audits and mine inspections may not discover any irregularities in these reports or, if we do discover errors, we\nmight not identify them in the reporting period in which they occurred. Any undiscovered reporting errors could result in\na loss of royalty revenues and errors identified in subsequent periods could lead to accounting disputes as well as\ndisputes with our lessees.\nBecause of the unique difficulties and uncertainties inherent in technology development, we face a risk of not being\nable to capitalize on our license or ownership of intellectual property.\nPotential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by companies developing new\ntechnology and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of our successful ability to commercialize\nintellectual property we own or license must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications\nand delays encountered in connection with the development of new technology with limited personnel and financial\nmeans. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated technical problems that extend the time\nand cost of product development or unanticipated problems with the operation of the technology.\nTechnology development involves significant time and expense and can be uncertain.\nThe development of technology associated with our licensed or owned intellectual property will be costly,\ncomplex and time-consuming. Any investment into technology development and commercialization often involves a\nlong wait until a return, if any, is achieved on such investment. We plan to make investments in research and\ndevelopment relating to our owned and licensed intellectual property and technology. Investments in new technology\nand processes are inherently speculative.\n37\nTable of Contents\nSuccessful technical development of technologies associated with intellectual property does not guarantee successful\ncommercialization.\nWe may successfully complete the technical development of technologies associated with our owned or\nlicensed intellectual property, but we may still fail to commercialize that technology at scale or at a cost attractive to the\ntarget industries. Our success will depend largely on our ability to prove the capabilities and cost-effectiveness of the\ndeveloped technology. Upon demonstration, the technology may not have the capabilities they were designed to have or\nthat we believed they would have, or they may be more expensive than anticipated. Furthermore, even if we do\nsuccessfully demonstrate the technology’s capabilities, potential customers may be more comfortable doing business\nwith a larger, more established, more proven company than us. Moreover, competing technologies may prevent us from\ngaining wide market acceptance of the technology. Significant revenue from new technology investments may not be\nachieved for a number of years, if at all.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, we could lose our ability to compete in the market.\nOur intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our ability to remain competitive and for the\nsuccess of our products and our business. Our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or\ncircumvented by third parties. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical\nknowledge or other trade secrets by employees or competitors. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop\ntechnologies and products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies and/or products, which could\nresult in decreased revenues. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to\nthe same extent as the laws of the United States. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights\nwhich could result in substantial costs to us and substantial diversion of management attention. If we do not adequately\nprotect our intellectual property, our competitors could use it to enhance their products. Our inability to adequately\nprotect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business and financial condition, and the value of our\nbrand and other intangible assets.\nOther companies may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, which could materially increase our costs and\nharm our ability to generate future revenue and profit.\nWe do not believe that we infringe the proprietary rights of any third party, but claims of infringement are\nbecoming increasingly common, and third parties may assert infringement claims against us. It may be difficult or\nimpossible to identify, prior to receipt of notice from a third party, the trade secrets, patent position or other intellectual\nproperty rights of a third party, either in the United States or in foreign jurisdictions. Any such assertion may result in\nlitigation or may require us to obtain a license for the intellectual property rights of third parties. If we are required to\nobtain licenses to use any third-party technology, we would have to pay royalties, which may significantly reduce any\nprofit on our products. In addition, any such litigation could be expensive and disruptive to our ability to generate\nrevenue or enter into new market opportunities. If any of our products were found to infringe other parties’ proprietary\nrights and we are unable to come to terms regarding a license with such parties, we may be forced to modify our\nproducts to make them non-infringing or to cease production of such products altogether.\nRisks Related to Environmental, Health, Safety and Other Regulations\nThe current U.S. administration and Congress could enact legislative and regulatory measures that could adversely\naffect our mining operations or cost structure or our customers’ ability to use coal, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn February 2021, the current administration announced reentry of the U.S. into the Paris Agreement along with\na new “nationally determined contribution” for U.S. GHG emissions that would achieve emissions reductions of at least\n50% relative to 2005 levels by 2030. The U.S. participated in the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change 26th\nConference of the Parties (“COP26”) held in Glasgow, Scotland in November 2021, advancing a Global Methane Pledge\nalong with the European Union, which aims to cut global methane pollution at least 30% by 2030 relative to 2020 levels,\nincluding “all feasible reductions” in the energy sector. Since its formal launch at COP26, over 100 countries\nrepresenting almost 70% of global GDP have signed. Most recently, at the 27th conference of parties (“COP27”),\n38\nTable of Contents\nPresident Biden announced the EPA’s proposed standards to reduce methane emissions from existing oil and gas\nsources, and agreed, in conjunction with the European Union and a number of other partner countries, to develop\nstandards for monitoring and reporting methane emissions to help create a market for low methane-intensity natural gas.\nVarious state and local governments have also publicly committed to furthering the goals of the Paris Agreement. The $1\ntrillion legislative infrastructure package passed by Congress in November 2021 includes a number of climate-focused\nspending initiatives targeted at climate resilience, enhanced response and preparation for extreme weather events, and\nclean energy and transportation investments. In August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of\n2022 into law. The Inflation Reduction Act provides significant funding and incentives for research and development of\nlow-carbon energy production methods, carbon capture, and other programs directed at addressing climate change. In\naddition, the Biden Administration has taken measures to unwind a number of regulatory rollbacks enacted or proposed\nby the Trump administration, including, among others, the ACE Rule, the NWPR, and the proposed NEPA overhaul. In\naddition, the Biden administration rolled back certain changes to the CCR made by the Trump administration. In January\n2022, the EPA announced several actions with respect to the coal combustion residuals rules, including reiterating that\nsurface impoundments cannot be closed with coal ash in contact with groundwater (in connection with the proposed\ndenial of closure deadline extensions due to failure of a permittee to demonstrate compliance with coal combustion\nresiduals rules – the EPA took final action to deny the request in November 2022) and establishing a federal permitting\nscheme for the disposal of coal ash and establish regulations for legacy coal ash surface impoundments. New, more\nstringent legislation or regulations related to the protection of the environment, health and safety or the reduction of\ngreenhouse gas emissions, as well as changes in the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations, may\nrequire us or our customers to change operations significantly or incur increased costs, which may adversely affect our\nmining operations, cost structure or our customers’ ability to use coal. Such changes could have a material adverse effect\non our financial condition and results of operations.\nLaws and regulations restricting or encouraging the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as well as uncertainty\nconcerning such regulations and increasing public attention toward climate change could adversely impact the\nmarket for coal, increase our operating costs, and reduce the value of our coal assets and our stock price.\nClimate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. There is widespread concern\nabout the contributions of human activity to such changes, especially through the emission of GHGs. Numerous reports,\nsuch as Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, have further raised concern about\nthe impacts of fossil fuel combustion on global climate issues. There are three primary sources of GHGs associated with\nthe coal industry. First, the end use of our coal by our customers in electricity generation, coke plants, and steelmaking is\na source of GHGs. Second, combustion of fuel by equipment used in coal production and to transport our coal to our\ncustomers is a source of GHGs. Third, coal mining itself can release methane, which is considered to be a more potent\nGHG than carbon dioxide, directly into the atmosphere. These emissions from coal consumption, transportation and\nproduction are subject to pending and proposed regulation as part of initiatives to address global climate change.\nAs a result, numerous proposals have been adopted, made and are likely to continue to be made at the\ninternational, national, regional, state and local levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs, including\nalternative energy requirements, measures promoting renewable energy development, and energy conservation and\nemissions reductions measures, among others. Collectively, these initiatives could result in higher electricity costs to our\ncustomers or lower the demand for coal used in electric or steel generation, which could in turn adversely impact our\nbusiness. Such initiatives, as well as increasing public attention to climate change more generally, could also result in\ndirect regulation of the GHGs produced by our operations or increase the potential for governmental investigations or\nlitigation. See “Business—Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters—Global Climate Change.”\nAt present, we are principally focused on metallurgical coal production, which is not used in connection with\nthe production of power generation. However, we may seek to sell greater amounts of our coal into the power-generation\nmarket in the future. The market for our coal may be adversely impacted if comprehensive legislation or regulations\nfocusing on GHG emission reductions are adopted, or if our customers are unable to obtain financing for their\noperations. The extent of future regulation of GHG emissions may inhibit utilities from investing in the building of new\ncoal-fired plants to replace older plants or investing in the upgrading of existing coal-fired plants. Any reduction in the\namount of coal consumed by electric power generators as a result of actual or potential regulation of GHG emissions,\nincluding any reductions resulting from power plants ceasing operations or switching to fuels that produce fewer GHG\n39\nTable of Contents\nemissions, could decrease demand for our coal, thereby reducing our revenues and materially and adversely affecting our\nbusiness and results of operations. We or prospective customers may also have to invest in carbon dioxide capture and\nstorage technologies in order to burn coal and comply with future GHG emission standards, and new legislation,\nregulations or international agreements in the future could otherwise result in increased costs to operate and maintain our\nor our customers’ facilities, capital expenditures to install other emission controls at our or our customers’ facilities, and\ncosts to administer and manage any potential climate-related reporting or greenhouse gas emissions trading or tax\nprograms. These costs and capital expenditures could be material and could increase the cost of and reduce demand for\nour products. Relatedly, to the extent others use or develop new technological advances in coal production in response to\nmarket or regulatory pressures to reduce their impact on the environment, we may be placed at a competitive\ndisadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement new technologies at substantial costs. We may not\nbe able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable\ncost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete, our business, financial\ncondition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. See also “—Product alternatives or other\ntechnologies may reduce demand for our products.”\nCurrent and future laws, regulations and other legal requirements relating to protection of the environment and\nnatural resources may increase our costs of doing business and may restrict our coal operations.\nWe and our potential customers are subject to stringent and complex laws, regulations and other legal\nrequirements enacted by federal, state and local authorities relating to occupational health and safety and protection of\nthe environment and natural resources. These include those legal requirements that govern discharges or emissions of\nmaterials into the environment, the management and disposal of substances and wastes, including hazardous wastes, the\ncleanup of contaminated sites, threatened and endangered plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of\nmining properties after mining is completed, mitigation and restoration of streams or other waters, the protection of\ndrinking water, assessment of the environmental impacts of mining, monitoring and reporting requirements, the\ninstallation of various safety equipment in our mines, remediation of impacts of surface subsidence from underground\nmining, and work practices related to employee health and safety. See “Business—Environmental and Other Regulatory\nMatters.” Examples include laws and regulations relating to:\n• occupational health and safety;\n• emissions to air and discharges to water;\n• plant and wildlife protection, including endangered species protections;\n• the reclamation and restoration of properties after mining or other activity has been completed;\n• limitations on land use;\n• mine permitting and licensing requirements;\n• the storage, treatment and disposal of wastes;\n• air quality standards;\n• water pollution;\n• protection of human health, plant-life and wildlife, including endangered and threatened species, and\nbiodiversity;\n• protection of wetlands;\n• the discharge of materials into the environment;\n• remediation of contaminated soil, surface and groundwater; and\n• the effects of operations on surface water and groundwater quality and availability.\nComplying with these environmental and employee health and safety requirements, including the terms of our\npermits, has had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on our costs of operations. In addition, there is the\npossibility that we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of environmental laws, judicial interpretations of\nor rulings on environmental laws or permits, or in connection with the investigation and remediation of environmental\ncontamination. For example, the EPA and several of the states where we operate have, or intend to, propose revised\nrecommended aquatic life criteria for discharges of selenium regulated under the CWA, which may be more stringent\nthan current criteria. The comment period for the EPA’s draft Selenium Technical Support Materials, intended to\nprovide implementation support for states for the recommend selenium aquatic life criterion for freshwater ended on\n40\nTable of Contents\nJanuary 3, 2022. Any additional laws, regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal, state and\nlocal authorities, or new interpretations of existing legal requirements by regulatory bodies relating to the protection of\nthe environment, including those related to discharges of selenium, could further affect our costs or limit our operations.\nSee “Business—Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters.”\nOur operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, and our properties may have\nenvironmental contamination, which could expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur operations currently use hazardous materials and generate limited quantities of hazardous wastes from time\nto time. Drainage flowing from or caused by mining activities can be acidic with elevated levels of dissolved metals, a\ncondition referred to as “acid mine drainage,” or may include other pollutants requiring treatment. We could become\nsubject to claims for toxic torts, natural resource damages and other damages as well as for the investigation and clean-\nup of soil, surface water, groundwater, and other media. Such claims may arise, for example, out of conditions at sites\nthat we currently own or operate, as well as at sites that we previously owned or operated, or may acquire. Our liability\nfor such claims may be joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the\ncontamination or other damages, or for the entire share.\nWe maintain coal refuse areas and slurry impoundments as necessary. Such areas and impoundments are\nsubject to extensive regulation. Structural failure of a slurry impoundment or coal refuse area could result in extensive\ndamage to the environment and natural resources, such as bodies of water that the coal slurry reaches, as well as liability\nfor related personal injuries and property damages, and injuries to wildlife. If an impoundment were to fail, we could be\nsubject to claims for the resulting environmental contamination and associated liability, as well as for fines and penalties.\nOur coal refuse areas and slurry impoundments are designed, constructed, and inspected by our company and by\nregulatory authorities according to stringent environmental and safety standards.\nWe must obtain, maintain, and renew governmental permits and approvals for mining operations, which can be a\ncostly and time-consuming process and result in restrictions on our operations.\nNumerous governmental permits and approvals are required for mining operations. Our operations are\nprincipally regulated under permits issued pursuant to the SMCRA and the federal CWA. State and federal regulatory\nauthorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance. Requirements imposed by these\nauthorities may be costly and time consuming and may result in delays in the commencement or continuation of\nexploration or production operations. In addition, we may be required to prepare and present to permitting or other\nregulatory authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that proposed exploration for or production of coal might\nhave on the environment.\nOur coal production is dependent upon our ability to obtain various federal and state permits and approvals to\nmine our coal reserves. The permitting rules, and the interpretations of these rules, are complex, change frequently, and\nare often subject to discretionary interpretations by regulators, all of which may make compliance more difficult or\nimpractical, and which may possibly preclude the continuance of ongoing mine development or operations or the\ndevelopment of future mining operations. The pace with which the government issues permits needed for new operations\nand for ongoing operations to continue mining, particularly CWA permits, can be time-consuming and subject to delays\nand denials. These delays or denials of environmental permits needed for mining could reduce our production and\nmaterially adversely impact our cash flow and results of operations.\nPrior to discharging any pollutants to waters of the United States, coal mining companies must obtain a NPDES\npermit from the appropriate state or federal permitting authority. NPDES permits include effluent limitations for\ndischarged pollutants and other terms and conditions, including required monitoring of discharges. Changes and\nproposed changes in state and federally recommended water quality standards may result in the issuance or modification\nof permits with new or more stringent effluent limits or terms and conditions. See “Business—Environmental and Other\nRegulatory Matters—Clean Water Act.”\nFurther, the public has certain statutory rights to comment on and submit objections to requested permits and\nenvironmental impact statements prepared in connection with applicable regulatory processes, and otherwise engage in\n41\nTable of Contents\nthe permitting process, including bringing citizens’ claims to challenge the issuance or renewal of permits, the validity of\nenvironmental impact statements or performance of mining activities. As a result of challenges like these, the permits we\nneed may not be issued or renewed in a timely fashion or issued or renewed at all, or permits issued or renewed may not\nbe maintained, may be challenged or may be conditioned in a manner that may restrict our ability to efficiently and\neconomically conduct our mining activities, any of which would materially reduce our production, cash flow, and\nprofitability.\nPermitting rules may also require, under certain circumstances, that we obtain surface-owner consent if the\nsurface estate has been severed from the mineral estate. This could require us to negotiate with third parties for surface\naccess that overlies coal we acquired or intend to acquire. These negotiations can be costly and time-consuming, lasting\nyears in some instances, which can create additional delays in the permitting process. If we cannot successfully negotiate\nfor land access, we could be denied a permit to mine coal we already own.\nFederal or state regulatory agencies have the authority to order certain of our mines to be temporarily or permanently\nclosed under certain circumstances, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our customers’\ndemands.\nFederal or state regulatory agencies have the authority, under certain circumstances following significant health\nand safety incidents, such as fatalities, to order a mine to be temporarily or permanently closed. If this occurred, we may\nbe required to incur capital expenditures to re-open the mine. In the event that these agencies order the closing of our\nmines, our coal sales contracts generally permit us to issue force majeure notices which suspend our obligations to\ndeliver coal under these contracts. However, our customers may challenge our issuances of force majeure notices. If\nthese challenges are successful, we may have to purchase coal from third-party sources, if it is available, to fulfill these\nobligations, incur capital expenditures to re-open the mines and/or negotiate settlements with the customers, which may\ninclude price reductions, the reduction of commitments, the extension of time for delivery or the termination of\ncustomers’ contracts. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur customers are subject to extensive existing and future laws, regulations and other legal requirements relating to\nprotection of the environment, which could negatively impact our business and the market for our products.\nCoal contains impurities, including sulfur, mercury, chlorine and other elements or compounds, many of which\nare released into the air when coal is burned. Complying with regulations to address these emissions can be costly for\nour customers. For example, in order to meet the CAA limits for sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power plants,\ncoal users must install costly pollution control devices, use sulfur dioxide emission allowances (some of which they may\npurchase), or switch to other fuels. More costly and stringent environmental regulations could adversely impact the\noperations of our customers, which could in turn adversely impact our business. A number of coal-fired power plants,\nparticularly smaller and older plants, already have retired or announced that they will retire rather than retrofit to meet\nthe obligations of these rules.\nIn addition, considerable uncertainty is associated with new air emissions initiatives that may require significant\nemissions control expenditures for many coal-fired power plants. As a result, some of our prospective customers may\nswitch to other fuels that generate fewer of these emissions or may install more effective pollution control equipment\nthat reduces the need for low-sulfur coal. Any further switching of fuel sources away from coal, closure of existing coal-\nfired power plants, or reduced construction of new coal-fired power plants could have a material adverse effect on\ndemand for, and prices received for, our coal. In addition, our coke plant and steelmaking customers may face increased\noperational costs as a result of higher electric costs. See “Business—Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters.”\nApart from actual and potential regulation of air emissions and solid wastes from coal-fired plants, state and\nfederal mandates for increased use of electricity from renewable energy sources could have an impact on the market for\nour coal. Many states, including Pennsylvania and Virginia, have enacted legislative mandates requiring electricity\nsuppliers to use renewable energy sources to generate a certain percentage of power. Possible advances in technologies\nand incentives, such as under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, to enhance the economics of renewable energy\nsources could make these sources more competitive with coal. Any reductions in the amount of coal consumed by\nelectric power generators as a result of current or new standards for the emission of impurities, or current or new\n42\nTable of Contents\nincentives to switch to renewable fuels or renewable energy sources could reduce the demand for our coal, thereby\nreducing our revenues and adversely affecting our business, cash flows, results of operations and our ability to pay\ndividends to our stockholders.\nNegative sentiment with regard to our business or our industry as well as activism, consumer preferences, and\ninitiatives aimed at limiting climate change or a reduction of air pollutants could interfere with our business\nactivities, operations and ability to access capital sources, result in reduced demand for our products, and negatively\nimpact our stock price.\nPublic perception of our industry’s contribution to climate change or detractions from the transition to a lower-\ncarbon economy has generated negative sentiment toward our industry and could result in reputational harm to our\nbusiness, lower demand for our products, and increased demand for alternatives to our products. Numerous activist\ngroups are devoting resources to anti-coal activities to minimize or eliminate the production of or use of coal as a source\nof electricity generation, domestically and internationally. Participants in the coal mining industry are frequently targeted\nby activist groups that openly attempt to disrupt the industry. For example, Greenpeace International filed a letter with\nthe SEC alleging that one coal mining company’s filings relating to a proposed public offering of securities may contain\nincomplete and misleading disclosures regarding the risks of investing in the coal market. On another occasion, the\nSierra Club sent a letter to the SEC stating that it believed a coal mining company may be giving potential investors false\nimpressions regarding risks to its business. Other groups have objected to our RAM No. 1 mine permit application in\nPennsylvania. It is possible that we could continue to be the target of similar actions in the future, including when we\nattempt to grow our business through acquisitions or commence new mining operations. Activist groups have also\nbrought lawsuits challenging the issuance of individual coal leases, historical and pending regulatory approvals, permits\nand processes that are necessary to conduct coal mining operations or to operate coal-fueled power plants. Negative\npublic perception could cause the permits we require to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed or burdened by\nrequirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number\nof government entities and private individuals have sought to bring suit against fossil fuel companies, alleging, among\nother things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to climate change or\nalleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but failed to\nadequately disclose such impacts to their investors or customers. Private individuals or public entities may also seek to\nenforce laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury, property damages or other liabilities in relation\nto climate change or other ESG matters. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could have an adverse impact on our\nfinancial condition. Any such activism could therefore materially and adversely impact our ability to operate our\nbusiness or raise capital.\nIn addition, there have also been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community, including\ninvestment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other groups, promoting the\ndivestment of fossil fuel equities; encouraging the consideration of environmental, social and governance (“ESG”)\npractices and ESG ratings of companies in a manner that may negatively affect coal companies, including increased\nnegative investor sentiment, divestment of securities issued by coal companies and the diversion of investment to other\nindustries; and also pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. For\nexample, certain financial institutions, including banks and insurance companies, have taken actions to limit available\nfinancing, insurance and other services to entities that produce or use fossil fuels. Several large investment banks have\nadopted climate change guidelines for lenders. The guidelines require the evaluation of carbon risks in the financing of\nelectric power generation plants, which may make it more difficult for utilities to obtain financing for coal-fired plants.\nThe impact of such efforts and developments may adversely affect the demand for and price of securities issued by us,\nadversely impact our access to the capital and financial markets, increase the cost of borrowing, cause a decline in our\ncredit rating, increase the cost or reduce the availability of third-party insurance, increase our retention of risk through\nself-insurance, and limit our flexibility and ability to conduct business development activities. Further, in California,\nlegislation was signed into law in September 2015 to require the state’s pension funds to divest investments in\ncompanies that generate 50% or more of their revenue from coal mining by July 2017. Additionally, Maine passed a law\nin June 2021 requiring the state pension system to divest holdings in coal, petroleum, natural gas and related products by\n2026, and the New York State Common Retirement Fund has and is continuing to divest from coal assets. These efforts\nand developments, as well as concerted conservation and efficiency efforts, could also cause coal prices and sales of our\ncoal to materially decline and could cause our costs to increase.\n43\nTable of Contents\nOther activist campaigns have urged companies to cease financing coal-driven businesses. A number of\ninvestors and asset managers have enacted such policies as a result, including by beginning to exit investments that\npresent high sustainability-related risks, such as thermal coal producers. The impact of such efforts may adversely affect\nthe demand for and price of securities issued by us and impact our access to the capital and financial markets. In\naddition, several well-funded non-governmental organizations have explicitly undertaken campaigns to minimize or\neliminate mining and the use of coal as a source of electricity generation. The net effect of these developments is to\nmake it more costly and difficult to maintain our business and to continue to depress the market for coal.\nOur mines are subject to stringent federal and state safety regulations that increase our cost of doing business at\nactive operations and may place restrictions on our methods of operation. In addition, government inspectors in\ncertain circumstances may have the ability to order our operations to be shut down based on safety considerations.\nThe MINE Act and MINER Act, and regulations issued under these federal statutes, impose stringent health\nand safety standards on mining operations. The regulations that have been adopted under the MINE Act and the MINER\nAct are comprehensive and affect numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine personnel, mining\nprocedures, roof control, ventilation, blasting, use and maintenance of mining equipment, dust and noise control,\ncommunications, emergency response procedures, and other matters. MSHA regularly inspects mines to ensure\ncompliance with regulations promulgated under the MINE Act and MINER Act. In addition, Pennsylvania, West\nVirginia, and Virginia all have similar programs for mine safety and health regulation and enforcement.\nThe various requirements mandated by federal and state statutes, rules, and regulations may place restrictions\non our methods of operation and potentially result in fees and civil penalties for violations of such requirements or\ncriminal liability for the knowing violation of such standards, significantly impacting operating costs and productivity. In\naddition, government inspectors have the authority to issue orders to shut down our operations based on safety\nconsiderations under certain circumstances, such as imminent dangers, accidents, failures to abate violations, and\nunwarrantable failures to comply with mandatory safety standards. See “Business—Environmental and Other Regulatory\nMatters—Mine Safety and Health.”\nThe regulations enacted under the MINE Act and MINER Act as well as under similar state acts are routinely\nexpanded, raising compliance costs and increasing potential liability. These existing and other future mine safety rules\ncould potentially result in or require significant expenditures, as well as additional safety training and planning,\nenhanced safety equipment, more frequent mine inspections, stricter enforcement practices and enhanced reporting\nrequirements. At this time, it is not possible to predict the full effect that new or proposed statutes, regulations and\npolicies will have on our operating costs, but any expansion of existing regulations, or making such regulations more\nstringent may have a negative impact on the profitability of our operations. If we were to be found in violation of mine\nsafety and health regulations, we could face penalties or restrictions that may materially and adversely impact our\noperations, financial results and liquidity.\nWe must also compensate employees for work-related injuries. State workers’ compensation acts typically\nprovide for an exception to an employer’s immunity from civil lawsuits for workplace injuries in the case of intentional\ntorts. In such situations, an injured worker would be able to bring suit against his or her employer for damages in excess\nof workers’ compensation benefits. In addition, West Virginia’s workers’ compensation act provides a much broader\nexception to workers’ compensation immunity, allowing an injured employee to recover against his or her employer if\nhe or she can show damages caused by an unsafe working condition of which the employer was aware and that was a\nviolation of a statute, regulation, rule or consensus industry standard. These types of lawsuits are not uncommon and\ncould have a significant effect on our operating costs.\nWe have obtained from a third-party insurer a workers’ compensation insurance policy, which includes\ncoverage for medical and disability benefits for black lung disease under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of\n1969 and the MINE Act. We perform periodic evaluations of our black lung liability, using assumptions regarding rates\nof successful claims, discount factors, benefit increases and mortality rates, among others. Of note, the Patient Protection\nand Affordable Care Act of 2010 significantly amended the black lung provisions of the MINE Act by reenacting two\nprovisions, which had been eliminated in 1981. Under the amendments, a miner with at least fifteen years of\n44\nTable of Contents\nunderground coal mine employment (or surface mine employment with similar dust exposure) who can prove that he\nsuffers from a totally disabling respiratory condition is entitled to a rebuttable presumption that his disability is caused\nby black lung. The other amendment provides that the surviving spouse of a miner who was collecting federal black lung\nbenefits at the time of his death is entitled to a continuation of those benefits. These changes could have a material\nimpact on our costs expended in association with the federal black lung program.\nWe have reclamation, mine closing, and related environmental obligations under the SMCRA. If the assumptions\nunderlying our accruals are inaccurate, we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated.\nThe SMCRA establishes operational, reclamation and closure standards for our mining operations. The\nSMCRA requires that comprehensive environmental protection and reclamation standards be met during the course of\nand following completion of mining activities. Permits for all mining operations must be obtained from the OSMRE or,\nwhere state regulatory agencies have adopted federally approved state programs under the SMCRA, the appropriate state\nregulatory authority. Our operations are located in states which have achieved primary jurisdiction for enforcement of\nthe SMCRA through approved state programs. See “Business—Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters.”\nIn addition, the SMCRA imposes a reclamation fee on all current mining operations, the proceeds of which are\ndeposited in the AML Fund, which is used to restore unreclaimed and abandoned mine lands mined before 1977. The\ncurrent per ton fee is $0.224 per ton for surface mined coal and $0.096 per ton for underground mined coal. These fees\nare currently scheduled to be in effect until September 30, 2034, and on November 15, 2021, the Infrastructure\nInvestment and Jobs Act (“IIJA”), which included the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Amendments of 2021,\nextended OSMRE’s statutory authority to collect reclamation fees for an additional 13 years and to reduce the fee rates.\nWe accrue for the costs of current mine disturbance and of final mine closure, including the cost of treating\nmine water discharge where necessary. The amounts recorded are dependent upon a number of variables, including the\nestimated future closure costs, estimated proven reserves, assumptions involving profit margins, inflation rates, and the\nassumed credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates. If these accruals are insufficient or our liability in a particular year is\ngreater than currently anticipated, our future operating results could be adversely affected. We are also required to post\nbonds for the cost of a coal mine as a condition of our mining activities.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nOur ability to pay dividends on our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock may be limited by the\namount of cash we generate from operations following the payment of fees and expenses, by restrictions in debt\ninstruments and by additional factors unrelated to our profitability.\nWe have paid quarterly dividends in the past and may pay additional special and regular quarterly dividends in\nthe future. Our ability to pay dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and the requirements of\napplicable law. The timing and amount of dividends declared will depend on, among other things: (a) our earnings,\nearnings outlook, financial condition, production, processing and shipping levels, financial condition, cash flow, cash\nrequirements and our outlook on current and future market conditions, (b) our liquidity, including our ability to obtain\ndebt and equity financing on acceptable terms, (c) restrictive covenants in our Credit and Security Agreement (the\n“Credit Agreement”) with KeyBank National Association, as the administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto,\nand any future debt instruments and (d) provisions of applicable law governing the payment of dividends.\nThe metallurgical coal industry is highly volatile, and we cannot predict with certainty the amount of cash, if\nany, that will be available for distribution as dividends in any period. Also, there may be a high degree of variability\nfrom period to period in the amount of cash, if any, that is available for the payment of dividends. The amount of cash\nwe generate from operations and the actual amount of cash we will have available for dividends will vary based upon,\namong other things:\n• risks related to the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic, such as the scope and duration of the\noutbreak, the health and safety of our employees, government actions and restrictive measures\n45\nTable of Contents\nimplemented in response, delays and cancellations of customer sales, supply chain disruptions and\nother impacts to the business, or our ability to execute our business continuity plans;\n• the development of our properties into producing coal mines;\n• the ability to begin generating significant revenues and operating cash flows;\n• the market price for coal;\n• overall domestic and global economic conditions, including the supply of and demand for domestic\nand foreign coal, coke and steel;\n• unexpected operational events or geological conditions;\n• cost overruns;\n• our ability to enter into agreements governing the sale of coal, which are generally short-term in nature\nand subject to fluctuations in market pricing;\n• the level of our operating costs;\n• prevailing global and regional economic and political conditions;\n• changes in interest rates;\n• the impact of domestic and foreign governmental laws and regulations, including environmental and\nclimate change regulations and regulations affecting the coal mining industry;\n• delays in the receipt of, failure to receive, failure to maintain or revocation of necessary governmental\npermits;\n• modification or revocation of our dividend policy by our board of directors; and\n• the amount of any cash reserves established by our board of directors.\nThe amount of cash we generate from our operations may differ materially from our net income or loss for the\nperiod, which will be affected by non-cash items. We may incur other expenses or liabilities that could reduce or\neliminate the cash available for distribution as dividends.\nIn addition, financing agreements may prohibit the payment of dividends if an event of default has occurred and\nis continuing or would occur as a result of the payment of such dividends.\nIn addition, Section 170 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) allows our board of directors\nto declare and pay dividends on the shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock either (i) out of our\nsurplus, as defined in and computed in accordance with the DGCL or (ii) in case there shall be no such surplus, out of\nour net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. We may not have\nsufficient surplus or net profits in the future to pay dividends, and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient funds, surplus\nor net profits to make distributions to us. As a result of these and the other factors mentioned above, we can give no\nassurance that dividends will be paid in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we ceased being an emerging growth company and, as a result, we have incurred and\nexpect to continue to incur significant additional legal and financial compliance costs by complying with increased\ndisclosure and governance requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2022, as a result of our market capitalization as of June 30, 2022, we became an\naccelerated filer and ceased being an emerging growth company. Therefore, we are subject to certain requirements that\napply to other public companies but did not previously apply to us due to our status as an emerging growth company.\nThese requirements include:\n• the provisions of Section 404 requiring that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an\nattestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\n• the requirement to provide detailed compensation discussion and analysis in proxy statements and reports\nfiled under the Exchange Act; and\n• the “say on pay” provisions (requiring a non-binding stockholder vote to approve compensation of certain\nexecutive officers) and the “say on golden parachute” provisions (requiring a non-binding stockholder vote\n46\nTable of Contents\nto approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and\ncertain other business combinations) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act,\nor the Dodd-Frank Act.\nWe have already incurred significant additional legal and financial compliance costs in connection with our loss\nof emerging growth company status. We expect that our compliance with these additional requirements, including the\nprovisions of Section 404, will continue to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make\nsome activities more time consuming and costly.\nYour percentage of ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage of ownership in us may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market\ntransactions or otherwise, including, without limitation, equity awards that we may be granting to our directors, officers\nand employees. Such issuances may have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the\nmarket price of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock.\nIt is anticipated that the compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company will grant additional\nequity awards to Company employees and directors, from time to time, under the Company’s compensation and\nemployee benefit plans. These additional awards will have a dilutive effect on the Company’s earnings per share, which\ncould adversely affect the market price of the Company’s Class A common stock and Class B common stock.\nIn addition, our Charter authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or\nseries of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other\nspecial rights, including preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as our board of\ndirectors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting\npower or reduce the value of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. For example, we could grant the\nholders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified\nevents or to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we\ncould assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our Class A common stock and Class B\ncommon stock.\nCertain of our directors have significant duties with, and spend significant time serving, entities that may compete\nwith us in seeking acquisitions and business opportunities and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in\nallocating time or pursuing business opportunities.\nCertain of our directors hold positions of responsibility with other entities (including Yorktown-affiliated\nentities) that are in the business of identifying and acquiring coal reserves. The existing positions held by these directors\nmay give rise to fiduciary or other duties that are in conflict with the duties they owe to us. These directors may become\naware of business opportunities that may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as to the other entities with which\nthey are or may become affiliated. Due to these existing and potential future affiliations, they may present potential\nbusiness opportunities to other entities prior to presenting them to us, which could cause additional conflicts of interest.\nThey may also decide that certain opportunities are more appropriate for other entities with which they are affiliated, and\nas a result, they may elect not to present those opportunities to us. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor.\nOur Charter and bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or\nmerger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and Class B common\nstock.\nOur Charter authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board\nof directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third-party to acquire us. In addition, some\nprovisions of our Charter and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of us, even if the\nchange of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:\n47\nTable of Contents\n• limitations on the removal of directors;\n• limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;\n• establishing advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the\nboard of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders;\n• providing that the board of directors is expressly authorized to adopt, or to alter or repeal our bylaws;\nand\n• establishing advance notice and certain information requirements for nominations for election to our\nboard of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder\nmeetings.\nOur Charter designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain\ntypes of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability\nto obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur Charter provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of\nChancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum\nfor (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary\nduty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a\nclaim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our Charter or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim\nagainst us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having\npersonal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. This exclusive forum provision does\nnot apply to a cause of action brought under federal or state securities laws. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise\nacquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of\nour Charter described in the preceding sentence. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to\nbring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or\nagents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these\nprovisions of our Charter inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or\nproceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. Our systems and procedures\nfor internal control over financial reporting and the disclosure controls related to them have, and may have in the\nfuture, material weaknesses, which may adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nWe are responsible for maintaining systems and documentation necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. These activities may divert management’s attention from other business concerns. As\ndescribed in Part II, Item 9A, “Controls and Procedures” in this Annual Report, we have determined that certain of our\ninternal controls over financial reporting have material weaknesses. If we are unable to correct those issues in a timely\nfashion, or if other internal control issues arise, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and cash flows, and investors could lose confidence in our reported results, thus affecting our ability\nto finance our business. To maintain and improve our controls and procedures, we must commit significant resources, may\nbe required to hire additional staff and will need to continue to provide effective management oversight, which could have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The material\nweaknesses will not be considered remediated until enhanced controls are implemented and operate for a sufficient period\nof time and management has concluded, through testing, that the related controls are effective. We can give no assurance\nthat the measures we take to remediate the material weaknesses will be effective.\nRisks Related to Our Class B Common Stock Structure\nHolders of Class B common stock are common stockholders of the Company and, therefore, are subject to risks\nassociated with an investment in the Company as a whole, even if a holder does not own shares of Class A common\nstock.\n48\nTable of Contents\nWe retain legal title to all of our assets and our tracking stock capitalization does not limit our legal\nresponsibility, or that of our subsidiaries, for the liabilities included in any set of financial statement schedules. Holders\nof Class B common stock do not have any legal rights related to specific assets attributed to CORE and, in any\nliquidation, holders of Class B common stock and Class A common stock will be entitled to receive a pro rata share of\nour available net assets based on their respective numbers of shares.\nOur Board’s ability to reattribute businesses, assets and expenses between the Class A common stock and Class B\ncommon stock may make it difficult to assess the future prospects of a class of common stock based on past\nperformance.\nOur Board currently expects to attribute 100% of the costs associated with the CORE Assets to Ramaco\nResources and zero such costs to CORE; however, our Board is vested with discretion to reattribute businesses, assets\nand liabilities that are attributed to one class of common stock to another class of common stock, without the approval of\nany of our stockholders. Any such reattribution made by our Board, as well as the existence, in and of itself, of the right\nto effect a reattribution may impact the ability of investors to assess the future prospects of the businesses and assets\nattributed to a class of common stock, including liquidity and capital resource needs to pay the projected dividend to\nholders of our Class B common stock, based on past performance. Stockholders may also have difficulty evaluating the\nliquidity and capital resources of the businesses and assets attributed to each class of common stock based on past\nperformance, as our Board may use the liquidity of one class to fund the liquidity of another class and capital\nexpenditure requirements through the use of loans and interests between classes.\nWe could be required to use assets attributed to one class of common stock to pay liabilities attributed to another\nclass.\nThe assets attributed to one class are potentially subject to the liabilities attributed to another class, even if those\nliabilities arise from lawsuits, contracts or indebtedness that are attributed to such other class. No provision of our\nSecond Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Amended Charter”) prevents us from satisfying\nliabilities of one class with assets of another class, and our creditors will not in any way be limited by our tracking stock\ncapitalization from proceeding against any assets they could have proceeded against if we did not have a tracking stock\ncapitalization.\nDividends on our Class B common stock are discretionary and may fluctuate materially quarter to quarter. We\ncannot guarantee that we will be able to pay dividends in the future or what the actual dividends will be for any future\nperiods.\nOur ability to pay dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board, the requirements of applicable law, any\nstatutory or contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends, any prior rights and preferences that may be applicable\nto any outstanding preferred stock and commercial factors, whether or not attributable to the CORE Assets. We may lack\nsufficient cash to pay dividends to our Class B stockholders due to cash flow shortfalls attributable to a number of\nfactors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as increases in corporate level general and administrative\nexpenses, principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt, tax expenses, working capital requirements and\nanticipated cash needs. The timing and amount of dividends declared in future periods will depend on, among other\nthings, (a) our earnings, earnings outlook, production, processing and shipping levels, financial condition, cash flow,\ncash requirements and our outlook on current and future market conditions, (b) our overall liquidity, (c) the restrictive\ncovenants in the Second Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement and any future debt instruments that we\nmay enter into and (d) provisions of applicable law governing the dividends. We have not established a minimum\ndividend payment for any class of our Common Stock, including our Class B common stock. Further our ability to pay\nand the amount of dividends declared in future periods may be harmed by other risk factors described herein and\nincorporated by reference herein. Our ability to pay dividends may fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter, and any\nquarterly estimate is subject to uncertainty due to the factors described above and elsewhere herein.\n49\nTable of Contents\nThe market price of the Class B common stock may not reflect the performance of CORE attributed to it, as we\nintend.\nWe cannot assure the holders of Class B common stock that the market price of the Class B common stock\nrelated to CORE will, in fact, reflect the performance of CORE attributed to it. Holders of Class B common stock are\ncommon stockholders of the Company as a whole and, as such, are subject to all risks associated with an investment in\nthe Company and all of our businesses, assets and liabilities. As a result, the market price of Class B common stock may,\nin part, reflect events that are intended to be reflected by the Class A common stock of the Company. In addition,\ninvestors may discount the value of Class B common stock because it is part of a common enterprise rather than a stand-\nalone entity.\nThe market price of the Class B common stock has been volatile, has fluctuated substantially, and could be affected\nby factors that do not affect traditional common stock.\nTo the extent the market price of the Class B common stock tracks the performance of more focused classes of\nbusinesses and assets than our Class A common stock does, the market price of the Class B common stock may be more\nvolatile than the market price of our existing common stock has been historically. The market price of the Class B\ncommon stock may be materially affected by, among other things:\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations CORE’s operating results;\n• potential acquisition activity by the Company (regardless of the class to which it is attributed) or the\ncompanies in which we invest;\n• issuances of debt or equity securities to raise capital by the Company or the companies in which we invest\nand the manner in which that debt or the proceeds of an equity issuance are attributed to each of the\nclasses;\n• changes in financial estimates by securities analysts regarding the Class B common stock, the Class A\ncommon stock or CORE attributable to the Class B common stock;\n• the complex nature and the potential difficulties investors may have in understanding the terms of our new\ntracking stock, as well as concerns regarding the possible effect of certain of those terms on an investment\nin our stocks; and\n• general market conditions.\nUntil an orderly trading market develops for the Class B common stock, the trading price of the Class B\ncommon stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market value of the Class B common stock could be adversely affected by events involving the other assets and\nbusinesses of the Company.\nBecause we are the issuer of the Class B common stock, an adverse market reaction to events relating to any of\nour assets and businesses, such as earnings announcements or announcements of new products or services, acquisitions\nor dispositions that the market does not view favorably, may cause an adverse market reaction in a particular class of\ncommon stock. This could occur even if the triggering event is not material to us as a whole. Certain events may also\nhave a greater impact on one class than the same triggering event would have on another class due to the asset\ncomposition of the affected class. In addition, the incurrence of significant indebtedness by us or any of our subsidiaries\non behalf of one class, including indebtedness incurred or assumed in connection with acquisitions of or investments in\nbusinesses, could affect our credit rating and that of our subsidiaries and, therefore, could increase the borrowing costs of\nbusinesses attributable to our other classes or the borrowing costs of the Company as a whole.\n50\nTable of Contents\nWe may not pay dividends equally or at all on our classes of common stock.\nWe have the right to pay dividends on the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock in equal\nor unequal amounts, and we may pay dividends on one class of common stock and not pay dividends on another class. In\naddition, any dividends or distributions on, or repurchases of, shares relating to a class will reduce our assets legally\navailable to be paid as dividends on another class.\nOur tracking stock capital structure could create conflicts of interest, and our Board may make decisions that could\nadversely affect only the holders of one class of our common stock.\nOur tracking stock capital structure could give rise to occasions when the interests of holders of one class of\ncommon stock might diverge or appear to diverge from the interests of holders of another class of common stock. Our\nClass B common stock is not issued by a separate entity and thus holders of Class B common stock do not have the right\nto elect a separate board of directors. As a result, the Company’s officers and directors owe fiduciary duties to the\nCompany as a whole and all of our stockholders as opposed to only holders of a particular class of common stock.\nDecisions deemed to be in the best interest of the Company and all of our stockholders may not be in the best interest of\na particular class of common stock when considered independently. Examples include:\n• decisions as to the terms of any business relationships between classes of common stock;\n• the terms of any reattributions of assets between classes of common stock;\n• decisions as to the allocation of consideration among the holders of Class B common stock and Class A\ncommon stock to be received in connection with a merger involving the Company;\n• decisions as to the allocation of corporate opportunities between the classes, especially where the\nopportunities might meet the strategic business objectives of both classes;\n• decisions as to operational and financial matters that could be considered detrimental to one class but\nbeneficial to the other;\n• decisions as to the conversion of shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock;\n• decisions regarding the creation of, and, if created, the subsequent increase or decrease of any interest that\none class of common stock may own in the other class of common stock;\n• decisions as to the internal or external financing attributable to businesses or assets attributed to any of our\nclasses of common stock;\n• decisions as to the dispositions of assets of any of our classes of common stock; and\n• decisions as to the payment of dividends on any of our classes of common stock.\nOur directors’ or officers’ equity ownership may create or appear to create conflicts of interest.\nIf directors or officers own disproportionate interests (in percentage or value terms) in Class A common stock\nor Class B common stock, that disparity could create or appear to create conflicts of interest when they are faced with\ndecisions that could have different implications for the holders of Class A common stock or Class B common stock.\nWe have not adopted any specific procedures for consideration of matters involving a divergence of interests\namong holders of Class A common stock or Class B common stock. Rather than develop additional specific procedures\nin advance, our Board intends to exercise its judgment from time to time, depending on the circumstances, as to how best\nto:\n51\nTable of Contents\n• obtain information regarding the divergence (or potential divergence) of interests;\n• determine under what circumstances to seek the assistance of outside advisers;\n• determine whether a committee of our Board should be appointed to address a specific matter and the\nappropriate members of that committee; and\n• assess what is in the Company’s best interests and the best interests of all of our stockholders.\nOur Board believes the advantage of retaining flexibility in determining how to fulfill its responsibilities in any\nsuch circumstances as they may arise outweighs any perceived advantages of adopting additional specific procedures in\nadvance.\nOur Board does not expect to formally adopt any management or allocation policies with respect to the CORE Assets.\nThe Board does not expect to formally adopt any management or allocation policies with respect to the CORE\nAssets to serve as guidelines in making decisions regarding the relationship between the Company’s overall business and\nCORE with respect to matters such as tax liabilities and benefits, loans between the two, attribution of assets, financing\nalternatives, corporate opportunities and similar items. Such determinations are in the sole discretion of our Board and\nour Board may at any time change or make exceptions to the relationship between CORE and Ramaco Resources. A\ndecision to change, or make exceptions to, these arrangements could disadvantage one class of stockholder while\nadvantaging the other.\nHolders of a class of common stock may not have any remedies if any action by our directors or officers has an\nadverse effect on only that class of common stock.\nPrinciples of applicable law and the provisions of our Amended Charter may protect decisions of our Board that\nhave a disparate impact upon a particular class of common stock. Under applicable law, our Board has a duty to act with\ndue care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders, regardless of the class of stock, or series, they hold.\nPrinciples of applicable law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock\nprovide that a Board owes an equal duty to all stockholders and does not have separate or additional duties to any subset\nof stockholders. Judicial opinions in Delaware involving tracking stocks have established that decisions by directors or\nofficers involving differing treatment of holders of tracking stocks may be judged under the business judgment rule. In\nsome circumstances, our directors or officers may be required to make a decision that is viewed as adverse to the holders\nof a particular series of that stock. Under the principles of applicable law and the business judgment rule referred to\nabove, the holders of Class B common stock may not be able to successfully challenge decisions that they believe have a\ndisparate impact upon the stockholders of one of our classes if a majority of our Board is disinterested and independent\nwith respect to the action taken, is adequately informed with respect to the action taken and acts in good faith and in the\nhonest belief that our Board is acting in the best interest of the Company and all of our stockholders.\nStockholders will not vote on how to attribute consideration received in connection with a merger involving the\nCompany among holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock.\nOur Amended Charter does not contain any provisions governing how consideration received in connection\nwith a merger or consolidation involving the Company is to be to the holders of Class A common stock and Class B\ncommon stock, and none of the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will have a separate class\nvote in the event of such a merger or consolidation. Consistent with applicable principles of applicable law, our Board\nwill seek to divide the type and amount of consideration received in a merger or consolidation involving the Company\namong holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock in a fair manner. As the different ways our Board\nmay divide the consideration between holders of the different classes of stock might have materially different results, the\nconsideration to be received by holders of Class B common stock in any such merger or consolidation may be materially\nless valuable than the consideration they would have received if they had a separate class vote on such merger or\nconsolidation.\n52\nTable of Contents\nWe may dispose of assets of CORE without the approval of the Class B common stockholders.\nApplicable law requires stockholder approval only for a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the\nassets of the Company taken as a whole, and our Amended Charter does not require a separate class vote in the case of a\nsale of a significant amount of assets attributed to any of our classes of common stock. As long as the assets attributed to\na certain class of common stock proposed to be disposed of represent less than substantially all of our assets, we may\napprove sales and other dispositions of any amount of the assets of such class without any stockholder approval.\nOur Board will decide, in its sole discretion, how to proceed and is not required to select the option that would\nresult in the highest value to holders of any particular class of stock.\nHolders of Class B common stock may receive less consideration upon a sale of the assets attributed to that class than\nif that class were a separate company.\nIf CORE was a separate, independent company and its shares were acquired by another person, certain costs of\nthat sale, including corporate level taxes, might not be payable in connection with that acquisition. As a result,\nstockholders of a separate, independent company with the same assets might receive a greater amount of proceeds than\nthe holders of Class B common stock would receive upon a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of CORE. In\naddition, we cannot assure the holders of Class B common stock that in the event of such a sale the per share\nconsideration to be paid to holders of Class B common stock will be equal to or more than the per share value of that\nshare of stock prior to or after the announcement of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of CORE. Further, there\nis no requirement that the consideration paid be tax-free to the holders of Class B common stock. Accordingly, if we sell\nall or substantially all of the assets attributed to CORE, our Class B stockholders could suffer a loss in the value of their\ninvestment in our Class B common stock.\nIn the event of a liquidation of Ramaco Resources, holders of Class B common stock will not have a priority with\nrespect to the assets attributed to CORE remaining for distribution to stockholders.\nUnder the Amended Charter, upon Ramaco Resources’ liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of\nClass A common stock and Class B common stock will be entitled to receive, in respect of their shares of such stock,\ntheir proportionate interest in all of Ramaco Resources’ assets, if any, remaining for distribution to holders of common\nstock in proportion to their respective number of shares. Hence, the assets to be distributed to a holder of either class of\ncommon stock upon a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Ramaco Resources will have nothing to do with the\nvalue of the assets attributed to the class of common stock or to changes in the relative value of the Class B common\nstock over time.\nOur Board may, in its sole discretion, elect to convert the Class B common stock to Class A common stock, thereby\nchanging the nature of an investment in the Class B common stock and possibly diluting the economic interest in the\nCompany of Class B common stock holders, which could result in a loss in value to such holders.\nOur Amended Charter permits our Board, in its sole discretion, to convert all of the outstanding shares of\nClass B common stock into shares of Class A common stock based on an exchange ratio determined by a 20-day trailing\nVWAP for each class of stock. A conversion would preclude the holders of Class B common stock from retaining their\ninvestment in a security that is intended to reflect separately the performance of CORE. We cannot predict the impact on\nthe market value of our stock of (1) our Board’s ability to effect any such conversion or (2) the exercise of this\nconversion right by our Board. In addition, our Board may effect such a conversion at a time when the market value of\nour different stocks could cause the stockholders of one group to be disadvantaged.\nHolders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together and have limited separate voting rights.\nHolders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class, except in certain\nlimited circumstances prescribed under applicable law. When holders of Class A common stock and Class B common\nstock vote together as a single class, holders having a majority of the votes will be in a position to control the outcome of\n53\nTable of Contents\nthe vote even if the matter involves a conflict of interest among our stockholders or has a greater impact on one class\nthan another.\nTransactions in Class B common stock by our insiders could depress the market price of those stocks.\nSales of, or hedging transactions such as collars relating to, shares of Class B common stock by any of our\ndirectors or executive officers, could cause a perception in the marketplace that the stock price of the Class B common\nstock has peaked or that adverse events or trends have occurred or may be occurring at the Company or with respect to\nthe Class B common stock. This perception can result notwithstanding any personal financial motivation for these\ntransactions. As a result, insider transactions could depress the market price for shares of the Class B common stock.\nOur capital structure, as well as the fact that CORE is not an independent company, may inhibit or prevent\nacquisition bids for CORE attributed to the Class B common stock and may make it difficult for a third party to\nacquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nIf CORE were a separate independent company, any person interested in acquiring CORE without negotiating\nwith management could seek control of that class by obtaining control of its outstanding voting stock, by means of a\ntender offer or a proxy contest. Although we intend Class B common stock to reflect the separate economic performance\nof CORE, it is not a separate entity, and a person interested in acquiring that class of common stock without negotiation\nwith our management could obtain control of that class only by obtaining control of a majority in voting power of all of\nthe outstanding voting shares of the Company. The existence of different classes of common stock could present\ncomplexities and in certain circumstances pose obstacles, financial and otherwise, to an acquiring person that are not\npresent in companies that do not have a capital structure similar to ours.\nCertain provisions of our Amended Charter and bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of the\nCompany that a stockholder may consider favorable.\nThese provisions include:\n• authorizing a capital structure with multiple classes of common stock: a Class A common stock and Class\nB common stock;\n• classifying our Board with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain\ncontrol of our Board;\n• prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a\nmeeting of the stockholders;\n• limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n• establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our Board or for\nproposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n• requiring stockholder approval by holders of at least 66 2/3% of our aggregate voting power with respect to\ncertain extraordinary matters, such as an amendment to our Amended Charter (excluding amendments to\nSection 4.1 thereof) or bylaws, and the approval by holders of at least 75% of our aggregate voting power\nfor the removal of a director; and\n• the existence of authorized and unissued stock, including “blank check” preferred stock, which could be\nissued by our Board to persons friendly to our then current management, thereby protecting the continuity\nof our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain\ncontrol of the Company.\n54\nTable of Contents\nGeneral Risk Factors\nChanges in tax legislation could have an adverse impact on our cash tax liabilities, results of operations or financial\ncondition.\nTax legislation enacted in 2017 reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and included\ncertain other changes that resulted in a significant reduction of our income tax liability. Congress could, in the future,\nrevise or repeal those changes or enact other tax law changes, such as the elimination of tax preferences currently\navailable with respect to coal exploration and development and the percentage depletion allowance. For example,\nPresident Biden has proposed increasing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 28%. We are unable to predict whether\nany such changes will ultimately be enacted, but any such changes could have a material impact on our cash tax\nliabilities, results of operations or financial condition.\nDebt we incur in the future may limit our flexibility to obtain financing and to pursue other business opportunities.\nOur future level of debt could have important consequences to us, including the following:\n• our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures or\nother purposes may be impaired, or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;\n• our funds available for operations and future business opportunities will be reduced by that portion of\nour cash flow required to make interest payments on our debt;\n• our ability to pay dividends if an event of default occurs and is continuing or would occur as a result of\npaying such dividend;\n• we may be more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy\ngenerally; and\n• our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions may be limited.\nOur ability to service our debt will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating\nperformance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other\nfactors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service any future\nindebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying our business activities, investments or\ncapital expenditures, selling assets or issuing equity. We may not be able to affect any of these actions on satisfactory\nterms or at all.\nThe terms of the indenture governing our Senior Notes and the agreements and instruments governing our other\nindebtedness, including the Credit Agreement, and surety bonding obligations impose restrictions that may limit our\noperating and financial flexibility.\nThe indenture governing our Senior Notes and the agreements governing our other indebtedness, including the\nCredit Agreement, and surety bonding obligations contain certain restrictions and covenants which restrict our ability to\nincur liens and/or debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of any other person and other restrictions, all of\nwhich could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity, and\ntherefore could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThese covenants limit, among other things, our ability to:\n• incur additional indebtedness;\n• pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of stock or make certain other restricted payments,\nsuch as share repurchases;\n• make capital investments;\n• enter into agreements that restrict distributions from certain subsidiaries;\n• sell or otherwise dispose of assets;\n• use for general purposes the cash received from certain allowable asset sales or disposals;\n55\nTable of Contents\n• enter into transactions with affiliates;\n• create or incur liens;\n• merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets; and\n• receive dividends or other payments from subsidiaries in certain cases.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and we may need to\nrefinance existing debt in the future. A breach of any of the covenants under the indenture together with the expiration of\nany cure period, if applicable, could result in a default under our indenture. If any such default occurs, subject to\napplicable grace periods, the holders of our Senior Note may elect to declare all outstanding Senior Notes, together with\naccrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. If the obligations under our\nSenior Notes were to be accelerated, our financial resources may be insufficient to repay the Senior Notes and any other\nindebtedness becoming due in full.\nIn addition, if we breach the covenants in the indenture governing the Senior Notes and do not cure such breach\nwithin the applicable time periods specified therein, we would cause an event of default under the indenture governing\nthe Senior Notes and a cross-default to certain of our other indebtedness and the lenders or holders thereunder could\naccelerate their obligations. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our indebtedness or borrow\nsufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable\nterms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our indebtedness is in default for any reason, our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these\ncovenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against\ncompanies who are not subject to such restrictions.\nThe number and quantity of viable financing and insurance alternatives available to us may be significantly impacted\nby unfavorable lending and investment policies by financial institutions and insurance companies associated with\nconcerns about environmental impacts of coal combustion, and negative views around our efforts with respect to\nenvironmental and social matters and related governance considerations could harm the perception of our company\nby a significant number of investors or result in the exclusion of our securities from consideration by those investors.\nCertain banks, other financing sources and insurance companies have taken actions to limit available financing\nand insurance coverage for the development of new coal-fueled power plants and coal producers and utilities that derive\na majority of their revenue from coal, and particularly from thermal coal. This may adversely impact the future global\ndemand for coal. Increasingly, the actions of such financial institutions and insurance companies are informed by non-\nstandardized “sustainability” scores, ratings and benchmarking studies provided by various organizations that assess\nenvironmental, social and governance matters. Further, there have been efforts in recent years by members of the general\nfinancial and investment communities, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds,\nuniversities and other institutional investors, to divest themselves and to promote the divestment of securities issued by\ncompanies involved in the fossil fuel extraction market, or that have low ratings or scores in studies and assessments of\nthe type noted above, including coal producers. These entities also have been pressuring lenders to limit financing\navailable to such companies. These efforts may have adverse consequences, including, but not limited to:\n• restricting our ability to access capital and financial markets in the future;\n• reducing the demand and price for our equity securities;\n• increasing the cost of borrowing;\n• causing a decline in our credit ratings;\n• reducing the availability, and/or increasing the cost of, third-party insurance;\n• increasing our retention of risk through self-insurance;\n• making it more difficult to obtain surety bonds, letters of credit, bank guarantees or other financing;\nand\n• limiting our flexibility in business development activities such as mergers, acquisitions and\ndivestitures.\n56\nTable of Contents\nIf securities or industry analysts adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating\nresults do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock could be influenced by the research and reports that industry or\nsecurities analysts may publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company\nor fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our\nstock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrade\nour stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.\nThe loss of our senior executives could have a material adverse effect on our business. There may be a limited\nnumber of persons with the requisite experience and skills to serve in our senior management positions. We may not be\nable to locate or employ qualified executives on acceptable terms. In addition, as our business develops and expands, we\nbelieve that our future success will depend greatly on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel\nwith coal industry experience. We may not be able to continue to employ key personnel or attract and retain qualified\npersonnel in the future. Our failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to\neffectively operate our business.\nWe could fail to retain customers or gain new ones.\nThe failure to obtain additional customers or the loss of all or a portion of the revenues attributable to any\ncustomer as a result of competition, creditworthiness, inability to negotiate extensions or replacement of contracts or\notherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and\nability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nTerrorist attacks or cyber-incidents could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or\nfinancial loss.\nLike most companies, we have become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies, including information\nsystems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, to operate our businesses, process and record financial and\noperating data, communicate with our business partners, analyze mine and mining information, estimate quantities of\ncoal reserves, as well as other activities related to our businesses. Strategic targets, such as energy-related assets, may be\nat greater risk of future terrorist or cyber-attacks than other targets in the United States. Deliberate attacks on, or security\nbreaches in, our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure of third parties, including systems that collect,\norganize, store or use personal data, or cloud-based applications could lead to corruption or loss of our proprietary data\nand potentially sensitive data, delays in production or delivery, difficulty in completing and settling transactions,\nchallenges in maintaining our books and records, environmental damage, communication interruptions, other operational\ndisruptions and third-party liability. Due to the nature of cyber-attacks, breaches to our or our service or equipment\nproviders’ systems could go unnoticed for a prolonged period of time. Our insurance may not protect us against such\noccurrences. Consequently, it is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, as cyber\nincidents continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our\nprotective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents.\nFailure to adequately protect critical data and technology systems and the impact of data privacy regulation could\nmaterially affect us.\nInformation technology solution failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our\noperations by causing delays or canceling or impeding processing of transactions and reporting financial results,\nresulting in the unintentional disclosure of employee, royalty owner, or other third party or our confidential information,\nor damage to our reputation. There can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, new laws\nand regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information pose increasingly\n57\nTable of Contents\ncomplex compliance challenges and potentially elevate costs, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations\n(or contractual provisions requiring similar compliance) could result in significant penalties and legal liability, require us\nto change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect our business. As\nnoted above, we are also subject to the possibility of cyber incidents or attacks, which themselves may result in a\nviolation of these laws or may result in significant expense.\nWe may be subject to litigation, the disposition of which could negatively affect our profitability and cash flow in a\nparticular period, or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations\nOur profitability or cash flow in a particular period could be affected by an adverse ruling in any litigation that\nmay be filed against us in the future. In addition, such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations. See “Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings.”\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nAs discussed earlier under General Risk Factors, we have become increasingly dependent upon technology,\nincluding information systems as well as infrastructure and cloud applications and services. These technologies are used\nto operate our businesses, process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our business partners,\nanalyze mining information, estimate quantities of coal reserves, and perform other activities related to our business.\nRamaco uses third parties to manage its information technology (“IT”) infrastructure. The Company’s process\nfor assessing, identifying, and managing material cybersecurity risks includes the following activities, all of which are\nperformed or assisted by third parties with considerable experience providing managed IT and security services or IT\nassurance services:\n• Assessment of cybersecurity risks, using the National Institute of Standards and Technology\nCybersecurity Framework as a guide, as part of the overall IT risk assessment performed annually;\n• Network operations center monitoring to establish baseline metrics and assist with anomaly detection;\n• Periodic vulnerability scanning;\n• Configuration of firewall, antivirus, and malware protection as well as alert thresholds;\n• Generation of system audit logs and recovery backups;\n• Preparation of an incident response plan and assignment of team members;\n• Logical access security reviews for applications and data protection; and\n• Awareness training for employees on cybersecurity threats and safe practices.\nThe Company also uses applications hosted by a reputable third party that are critical to managing Ramaco’s\nbusiness and financial records. The process to oversee and identify cyber risks associated with the third-party service\nprovider involves reviewing its annual System and Organization Controls 2 (“SOC 2”), Type 2 Report as well as\nconducting recurring status meetings with the third party.\nThe responsibility for managing and assessing material risks from cybersecurity threats lies with the\nCompany’s IT Steering Committee, which is made up of five members of senior management having legal or corporate\nfinance backgrounds. The committee also includes one lead representative of the third-party IT management and security\nservice providers utilized by the Company to mitigate cybersecurity risks as discussed above. The IT Steering\nCommittee met at least on a quarterly basis during 2023 and intends to meet monthly going forward. Information\nregarding cybersecurity risks and mitigation efforts is reported periodically by the IT Steering Committee to the\nCompany’s chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is primarily\nresponsible for the Board of Directors’ oversight of cybersecurity risks.\n58\nTable of Contents\nWe have not experienced any cybersecurity incidents to date that have materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, the Company’s business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However,\ncybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, and we may not be successful in preventing or mitigating a cybersecurity\nincident despite our efforts to protect against such risks. A successful cyberattack could lead to theft of sensitive\ninformation, ransomware, destruction of data, or other issues causing financial, legal, or reputational damage. These\nevents are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial\ncondition, should they occur.\nItem 2. Properties\nSummary Overview of Mining Operations\nInformation concerning our mining properties in this Annual Report has been prepared in accordance with the\nrequirements of subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K, which requires us to disclose our mineral resources, in addition to our\nmineral reserves, as of the end of our most recently completed fiscal year both in the aggregate and for each of our\nindividually material mining properties.\nAs used in this Annual Report, the terms “mineral resource,” “measured mineral resource,” “indicated mineral\nresource,” “inferred mineral resource,” “mineral reserve,” “proven mineral reserve” and “probable mineral reserve” are\ndefined and used in accordance with subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. Under subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K, mineral\nresources may not be classified as “mineral reserves” unless the determination has been made by a qualified person that\nthe indicated and measured mineral resources can be the basis of an economically viable project. You are specifically\ncautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral resources will ever be converted into mineral reserves, as\ndefined by the SEC. See “Item 1A “Risk Factors”\nYou are cautioned that, except for that portion of mineral resources classified as mineral reserves, mineral\nresources do not have demonstrated economic value. Inferred mineral resources are estimates based on limited\ngeological evidence and sampling and have a too high of a degree of uncertainty as to their existence to apply relevant\ntechnical and economic factors likely to influence the prospects of economic extraction in a manner useful for evaluation\nof economic viability. Estimates of inferred mineral resources may not be converted to a mineral reserve. It cannot be\nassumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. A significant\namount of exploration must be completed in order to determine whether an inferred mineral resource may be upgraded\nto a higher category. Therefore, you are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource\nexists, that it can be the basis of an economically viable project, or that it will ever be upgraded to a higher category.\nLikewise, you are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated mineral resources will ever be\nconverted to mineral reserves. See “Item 1A “Risk Factors”\nThe information that follows relating to the Elk Creek Complex, Berwind Complex, and Knox Creek Complex\nis derived, for the most part, from, and in some instances is an extract from, the technical report summaries (“TRS”)\nrelating to such properties prepared in compliance with the Item 601(b)(96) and subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K.\nPortions of the following information are based on assumptions, qualifications and procedures that are not fully\ndescribed herein. Reference should be made to the full text of the TRSs, incorporated herein by reference and made a\npart of this Annual Report.\n59\nTable of Contents\nItem 2 Properties, Figure 1 below shows the location of our mining properties and offices as of December 31,\n2023:\n60\nTable of Contents\nAt December 31, 2023, we had five mining properties, as summarized in the table below (tons produced in 000s),\nexcluding the Brook Mine property:\nClean Tons Clean Tons Clean Tons\nControlled Produced Produced Produced Processing Facilities -\nLocation Acres Yrs Stage 2021 2022 2023 Mine Type Quality Transportation\nLogan, High\nElk Underground,\nWyoming, and Volatile\nCreek 20,200 20+ Production 1,981 2,033 2,031 Highwall,\nMingo Counties, A, A/B, Elk Creek Preparation\nComplex Surface\nWV B Plant - CSX RR, Truck\nMcDowell\nCounty, WV, Underground, Low and Berwind Preparation\nBerwind\nBuchanan and 62,500 20+ Production 180 416 601 Highwall, Mid Plant - Truck, Norfolk\nComplex\nTazewell Surface Volatile Southern RR\nCounties, VA\nMcDowell\nCounty, WV, Mid and Knox Creek\nKnox Underground,\nBuchanan, High Preparation Plant -\nCreek 64,050 15 Production 45 235 370 Highwall,\nRussell, and Volatile Truck, Norfolk\nComplex Surface\nTazewell A Southern RR\nCounties, VA\nWyoming and Underground, Berwind Preparation\nMaben Low\nRaleigh 28,000 18 Production — — 172 Highwall, Plant - Truck, Norfolk\nComplex Volatile\nCounties, WV Surface Southern RR\nCommercial High\nRAM Washington\n1,567 n/a Development — — — Underground Volatile Truck, Barge\nMine County, PA\nor Other C\nTotal 176,317 2,206 2,684 3,174\nAt December 31, 2023, we owned or controlled, primarily through long-term leases, approximately 174,750\nacres of coal in Virginia and West Virginia and 1,567 acres of coal in Pennsylvania. The aggregate annual production for\nour properties during the three most recently completed fiscal years are as follows: 3.2 million tons for fiscal year 2023,\n2.7 million tons for fiscal year 2022, and 2.2 million tons for fiscal year 2021. Our preparation plants and loadout\nfacilities are located on properties owned by us or held under leases which expire at varying dates over the next 30 years.\nMost of the leases contain options to renew. Many of these leases provide for a royalty payment to the lessor based on a\nspecific price per ton of coal extracted or as a percentage of coal sales revenue. We believe that all of our leases were\nentered into at market terms.\nThe Company leases office space in Lexington, Kentucky that serves as its executive headquarters. In addition,\nthe Company owns office space in Charleston, West Virginia that serves as an operations center. The Company also\nowns offices in Sheridan, Wyoming. See Item 1. “Business - Our Projects” for additional information about our mining\noperations and CORE initiatives.\nWe hold numerous environmental and mineral extraction permits, water rights and other permits, licenses and\napprovals from governmental authorities authorizing operations at each of our facilities. With respect to each facility at\nwhich we produce coal, permits, licenses and approvals are obtained as needed in the normal course of business based on\nour mine plans and federal, state, and local regulatory provisions regarding mine permitting and licensing. Based on our\nhistorical permitting experience, we expect to be able to continue to obtain necessary mining permits and approvals to\nsupport historical rates of production.\nWe are the operators of the mining and processing operations and the mining methods we use consist of\nsurface, underground and highwall mining methods. The mining operations for the Elk Creek, Berwind, and Knox Creek\ncomplexes are material to our business and are further described below.\n61\nTable of Contents\nElk Creek Complex\nThe Elk Creek Complex is located approximately 45 miles south of Charleston, West Virginia, in Logan,\nWyoming, and Mingo Counties at N 37.698718, W 81.778297. The nearest town is Man, West Virginia, which is\napproximately five miles to the northwest of the Elk Creek Complex. The Elk Creek Complex is within the Southern\nWest Virginia coal field of the Central Appalachia Coal Producing Region (the “CAPP Region”) of the United States.\nCompanies that previously mined on the Elk Creek Complex include Island Creek Coal Company (“Island\nCreek”) which started mining in the area in December 1904. Consolidation Coal Company, now known as Consol\nEnergy, Inc. (“Consol”), bought Island Creek in July 1993 and continued operations in and around the area until the late-\n1990s when Consol idled its Elk Creek Mine. Ramaco Coal bought the property from Consol in 2012 and started\nproduction on the Elk Creek Complex in the fourth quarter of 2016. The 2012 purchase included acquisition of rail\naccess, permitted impoundment and coal refuse disposal facilities, as well as numerous reclaimed, but permitted deep\nmines. Pittston Coal Company operated mines on the northern Huff Creek portion (McDonald and Baisden properties) of\nthe Elk Creek Complex in the 1970s and 1980s before the company exited the coal mining business in 2001.\nThe Elk Creek Complex consists of approximately 20,200 acres of leased coal holdings. Within the Elk Creek\nComplex controlled coal holdings, 16,000 acres lie in Logan County, 2,800 acres in Wyoming County and 1,400 acres in\nMingo County. The Elk Creek Complex is in the production stage and currently has six active mines, three planned and\npermitted mines, one permitted inactive mine, and one planned but not permitted mine. The five planned and/or\npermitted mines include two contour surface mine developing areas for a highwall miner, and three underground room\nand pillar mines, which use continuous miners for mine development. Ramaco began production of metallurgical coal at\nthe complex in 2016. A majority of the underground mines implement retreat mining, which results in mining recovery\nof greater than 80 percent. Contour mining has an average mining recovery of approximately 90 percent, and the\nhighwall mines have an average mining recovery of approximately 40 percent.\nThe Elk Creek Complex is mining several seams and seam splits, including the Chilton A, Upper Dorothy,\nUpper Dorothy 2, 3, and 4, Middle Dorothy, Lower Dorothy, Upper Cedar Grove, Lower Cedar Grove A, Lower Cedar\nGrove B, Lower Cedar Grove C, Upper Alma, Lower Alma, Powellton, Eagle, and No. 2 Gas seams, in descending\nstratigraphic order.\nCurrently, there are six active mines within the complex:\n• Ram No. 1 Surface and Highwall Mine;\n• Stonecoal No. 2 Alma Deep Mine;\n• Rockhouse Eagle Deep Mine;\n• No. 2 Gas Deep Mine;\n• Michael Powellton Deep Mine; and\n• Crucible Deep Mine Lower Cedar Grove B and C seams\nThere are three planned and permitted mines within the complex:\n• Ram No. 3 Surface and Highwall Mine, scheduled for 2024 startup\n• Ram No. 2 Surface and Highwall Mine (which is the extension of Ram No. 1 above), scheduled for\nlate 2024 startup; and\n• Glen Alum Tunnel #1 Deep Mine, scheduled for 2027 startup.\nThere are two permitted inactive mines, the Eight-Kay Deep Mine that is projected to start in 2027 as well as\nthe Monarch Deep Mine that is scheduled to start in 2026. The Bens Creek Deep Mine is planned but is not yet\npermitted. The projected startup date for this mine is 2028. It is likely future mines will be planned and scheduled, as\nnecessary, from resource areas within the complex, to meet internal Ramaco production goals aligned with market\nconditions. With the exception of the Ram No. 3 mine, all planned mines are subject to future Board approval.\nThe current Elk Creek Complex Life-of-Mine (“LOM”) Plan projects mining through 2040; an expected mine\nlife for the complex of 17 years.\n62\nTable of Contents\nAll Run-of-Mine (“ROM”) coal is washed at the Elk Creek Preparation Plant. The Elk Creek Preparation Plant,\nbuilt in 2017 by Raw Resources Group located in Princeton, West Virginia, is a well designed and constructed\npreparation plant, with ROM processing capacity of 700 tons per hour. During 2022, we began work on a throughput\nupgrade at our Elk Creek Preparation plant. We completed the expansion in 2023, which raised the nameplate processing\ncapacity to 1,050 raw tons per hour and our annual processing capacity from this complex to approximately three million\ntons per year.\nWe also began development work on additional low-cost, high-volatile underground and surface mines at Elk\nCreek. These mines began production during the second quarter of 2022 and reached full levels of productivity during\n2023. Production increased at Elk Creek during 2023 commensurate with the increase in processing capacity discussed\nabove.\nThe gross book value of the Elk Creek Complex property and its associated plant and equipment was $269\nmillion as of December 31, 2023. The Elk Creek Complex utilizes industry standard, modern surface and underground\nmining equipment, processing equipment and infrastructure that is in good operating condition and capable of meeting\nplanned production requirements using prudent operating methods and operating schedules.\nThe Elk Creek Complex produces high-quality, high-volatile metallurgical coal. Historically, the market for\nmetallurgical coal from the Elk Creek Complex has been domestic metallurgical coal consumers and the global seaborne\nmetallurgical coal market. Coal produced from the complex is primarily high-volatile A and high-volatile B\nmetallurgical coal. The Elk Creek Complex also produces thermal coal and specialty coals, which represent\napproximately five percent of sales.\nVolatiles refers to the volatile matter contained in the coal. Classification of coal as low, mid or high-volatile\nrefers to the specific volatile content within the coal, with coals of 17% to 22% volatile matter being classified as low-\nvolatile, 23% to 31% as mid-volatile and 32% or greater as high-volatile. The volatile matter in coal impacts coke yield\n(i.e. the amount of coke and coke by-products produced per ton of coal charged). Low-volatile coal contains more\ncarbon, but too much carbon can result in coke oven damage. Too much volatile matter results in less carbon and\nreduces the volume of coke produced. Therefore, coke producers use blends of high-volatile and low-volatile coals for\ncoke production.\nWe are unaware of any significant encumbrances to the Elk Creek Complex, including current and future\npermitting requirements and associated timelines, permit conditions, and violations and fines.\nBerwind Complex\nThe Berwind Complex is located approximately 80 miles south of Charleston, West Virginia; 100 miles west of\nRoanoke, Virginia; 60 miles northeast of Kingsport, Tennessee; and 160 miles east/southeast of Lexington, Kentucky at\nN 37.164522, W 81.744893. The complex includes areas in Buchanan and Tazewell Counties, Virginia and McDowell\nCounty, West Virginia. The Berwind Complex is within the Southwestern Virginia and Southern West Virginia coal\nfields of the CAPP Region of the United States.\nThe Berwind Complex and surrounding area have an extensive history of coal mining, primarily by\nunderground mining methods. Mining within the Berwind/Knox Creek Complex likely began in the early-1900s and\nthere have been many different mine operators both large and small in the region since then.\nThe Berwind Property consists of approximately 62,500 acres of leased coal holdings located in McDowell\nCounty, West Virginia and Buchanan and Tazewell Counties, Virginia. Ramaco obtained its initial lease for this property\nin 2015 and commenced mine operations in 2017. The Berwind Complex is in the production stage and currently has\nthree active mines. The three mines that were active at December 31, 2023 are underground room and pillar mines,\nwhich use continuous miners for mine development.\nRamaco started operations at the Berwind Pocahontas 4 Deep Mine in 2017 and idled the mine in mid-July\n2022 due to an ignition that an investigation by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) suggests was\n63\nTable of Contents\ncaused by lightning that struck a pilot hole for a new shaft. Production at the Berwind No. 1 Deep Mine restarted in the\nfirst quarter of 2023.\nA majority of the underground mines implement retreat mining, which typically results in mining recovery of\ngreater than 80 percent. Contour mining has an average mining recovery of approximately 90 percent, and the highwall\nmine has an average mining recovery of approximately 40 percent.\nThe Berwind Complex is mining several seams and seam splits, including the Pocahontas 6, Pocahontas 5,\nPocahontas 4 and Pocahontas 3 seams, in descending stratigraphic order.\nActive Mines:\n• Laurel Fork Pocahontas 3 Deep Mine\n• Triad No. 2 Deep Mine\n• Berwind No. 1 Pocahontas 4 Deep Mine\nPermitted Mines:\n• Squire Jim No. 1 Deep Mine, permitted but not planned for startup\nThe current Berwind Complex Life-of-Mine (LOM) Plan projects mining through 2049, an expected mine life\nfor the complex of 20+ years. However, it is likely future mines will be planned and scheduled, as necessary, from\nresource areas within the complex, to meet internal Ramaco production goals aligned with market conditions.\nAll Run-of-Mine (ROM) coal is washed at the Berwind Preparation Plant with no planned direct shipment coal.\nThe Berwind Preparation Plant was initially built in 1955 and commissioned in 1957. Ramaco refurbished the\npreparation plant in 2021 and 2022 based on a design by Ramsey Industrial, with a current ROM processing capacity of\n600 tons per hour.\nThe gross book value of the Berwind Complex property and its associated plant and equipment was $155\nmillion as of December 31, 2023. The Berwind Complex utilizes industry standard, modern surface and underground\nmining equipment, processing equipment and infrastructure that is in good operating condition and capable of meeting\nplanned production requirements using prudent operating methods and operating schedules.\nThe Berwind Complex produces high-quality, mid and low-volatile metallurgical coal. Historically, the market\nfor metallurgical coal from the Berwind Complex has been for both domestic metallurgical coal consumers and the\nglobal seaborne metallurgical coal market.\nWe are unaware of any significant encumbrances to the Berwind Complex, including current and future\npermitting requirements and associated timelines, permit conditions, and violations and fines.\nKnox Creek Complex\nThe Knox Creek Complex consists of two general properties or areas as follows:\n• Big Creek Property; and\n• Knox Creek Property\nThe Knox Creek Complex is located approximately 80 miles south of Charleston, West Virginia; 100 miles\nwest of Roanoke, Virginia; 60 miles northeast of Kingsport, Tennessee; and 160 miles east/southeast of Lexington,\nKentucky at N 37.164522, W 81.744893. The complex includes areas in Buchanan, Russell and Tazewell Counties,\nVirginia and McDowell County, West Virginia. The Knox Creek Complex is within the Southwestern Virginia and\nSouthern West Virginia coal fields of the CAPP Region of the United States.\nThe Knox Creek Complex and surrounding area have an extensive history of coal mining, primarily by\nunderground mining methods. Mining within the Knox Creek Complex likely began in the early-1900s and there have\nbeen many different mine operators both large and small in the region since then.\n64\nTable of Contents\nThe Knox Creek Complex consists of approximately 64,050 acres of owned and leased coal holdings. Within\nthe Knox Creek Complex controlled coal holdings, 5,370 acres lie in McDowell County, West Virginia. The Knox Creek\nComplex is in the production stage and currently has two active mines and two planned and permitted mines. There are\nno active or planned West Virginia mines currently within the Knox Creek Complex. The two active mines include one\ncontour surface mine developing areas for a highwall miner, and one underground room and pillar mine, which uses\ncontinuous miners for mine development.\nRamaco began production of metallurgical coal at the complex in 2019. The underground mines will implement\nretreat mining, which typically results in mining recovery of 50 to 80 percent. At the surface mine, contour mining has\nan average mining recovery of approximately 90 percent, and highwall mining has an average mining recovery of\napproximately 40 percent.\nThe Knox Creek Complex is mining or plans to mine several seams and seam splits, including the Jawbone,\nKennedy and Tiller seams.\nActive Mines:\n• Big Creek Jawbone No. 1 Deep Mine\n• Big Creek Surface and Highwall Mine\nPlanned and Permitted Mines:\n• Knox Creek Tiller Deep Mine, scheduled for 2026 startup\n• Kennedy No. 3 Deep Mine, scheduled for 2026 startup\nThe current Knox Creek Complex Life-of-Mine (LOM) Plan projects mining through 2037, an expected mine\nlife for the complex of 15 years. It is anticipated that future mines will be planned and scheduled, as necessary, from\nresource areas within the complex, to meet internal Ramaco production goals aligned with market conditions. Both\nplanned mines listed above are subject to future Board approval.\nAll Run-of-Mine (ROM) coal is washed at the Knox Creek Preparation Plant. The Knox Creek Preparation\nPlant, built in 1981 by Powell Construction Company located in Johnson City, Tennessee, is a well designed and\nconstructed preparation plant, with ROM processing capacity of 750 tons per hour.\nThe gross book value of the Knox Creek Complex property and its associated plant and equipment was $47\nmillion as of December 31, 2023. The Knox Creek Complex utilizes industry standard, modern surface and underground\nmining equipment, processing equipment and infrastructure that is in good operating condition and capable of meeting\nplanned production requirements using prudent operating methods and operating schedules.\nThe Knox Creek Complex produces high-quality, mid and high-volatile metallurgical coal. Historically, the\nmarket for metallurgical coal from the Knox Creek Complex has included both domestic metallurgical coal consumers\nand the global seaborne metallurgical coal market. The Knox Creek Complex also sporadically produces a minimal\nquantity of thermal coal from the surface mine from oxidized zones.\nWe are unaware of any significant encumbrances to the Knox Creek Complex, including current and future\npermitting requirements and associated timelines, permit conditions, and violations and fines.\nOther Properties\nRefer to the discussion of our Maben Complex and our RAM Mine under Item 1. “Business - Our Projects” for\ninformation about these properties, which are not included in the disclosures of mineral resources and reserves at\nDecember 31, 2023 to follow.

Our coal resource\nand reserve estimates are based on data obtained from our drilling activities and other available geologic data. Acquisitions\nor sales of coal properties will change these estimates. Changes in mining methods or the utilization of new technologies\nmay increase or decrease the recovery basis for a coal seam. The most recent studies of our coal reserves for the Elk Creek\nComplex, Berwind Complex, and Knox Creek Complex were prepared by an independent engineering firm, Weir\nInternational, Inc. (“Weir”). In periods between third party updates, we update reserves utilizing our internal staff of\nengineers and geologists based on production data. We intend to continue to periodically retain outside experts to assist\nmanagement with the verification of our estimates of our coal reserves going forward.\nWeir prepared our reserve reporting in compliance with the Regulation S-K 1300 requirements. Weir initiated\nthis process with us by completing a historical project review as well as its validation of our complete drill hole database.\nWeir validated that property control is accurately reflected in reserve modeling, verifying the latest property boundaries,\nincluding control by each seam. Weir also examined reserve boundaries to ensure agreement with mining parameters, such\nas minimum thickness, minimum yield and minimum inter-burden between seams. Resource classification is determined\nbased on the expectation of our meeting these mining parameters. Weir also conducted mining integrity checks to ensure\neach reserve area is minable.\n67\nTable of Contents\nIn determining whether our reserves meet this standard, we take into account, among other things, our potential\nability to obtain a mining permit, the possible necessity of revising a mining plan, changes in estimated future costs,\nchanges in future cash flows caused by changes in costs required to be incurred to meet regulatory requirements and\nobtaining or renewing mining permits, variations in quantity and quality of coal, and varying levels of demand and their\neffects on selling prices. Further, the economic recoverability of our reserves is based on market conditions including\ncontracted pricing, market pricing and overall demand for our coal. Thus, the actual value at which we no longer consider\nour reserves to be economically recoverable varies depending on the length of time in which the specific market conditions\nare expected to last. We consider our reserves to be economically recoverable at a price in excess of our cash costs to mine\nthe coal and fund our ongoing replacement capital. The reserves in this Annual Report are classified by reliability or\naccuracy in decreasing order of geological assurance as Proven (Measured) and Probable (Indicated).\nSummaries of the mineral resources and mineral reserves as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are\nshown below. Weir served as the QP and prepared the estimates of mineral resources and mineral reserves at the Berwind\nComplex, Knox Creek Complex, and Elk Creek Complex. Since a material change has not occurred from the last TRS\nfiled for each complex, the previous years’ TRSs have not been updated. Refer to Exhibit 96.1, 96.2, and 96.3 for access\nto the previous TRS for the Berwind Complex, Knox Creek Complex, and Elk Creek Complex, respectively.\nYear ended De cember 31, Year ended De cember 31,\n2023 2022\nMeasured Proven + Measured Proven +\n+ Probable + Probable\nIndicated Clean Indicated Clean\nIn-Place Recoverable In-Place Recoverable\n(in millions) Resources Reserves Resources Reserves\nArea\nBerwind Complex 629 23 629 24\nKnox Creek Complex 275 8 301 8\nElk Creek Complex 215 28 215 30\nRAM Mine — — 11 —\nTotal 1,119 59 1,156 62\nEstimates of coal reserves and resources are updated annually to reflect changes resulting from active mine\nproduction, mine plan modifications, property acquisitions/sales, impacts of additional exploration drilling, and any\nother changes that impact remaining coal reserve and resource tonnage.\nThe combined proven and probable reserves at the Berwind, Knox Creek and Elk Creek complexes decreased\nby three million tons due to 2023 production. Measured and indicated coal resources decreased by 37 million tons during\n2023, approximately 25 million tons were due to property control changes (assignment of coal leases) at the Knox Creek\nComplex and 11 million tons were due to the permit denial at the RAM mine and our decision not to pursue an appeal.\nKey assumptions and parameters relating to the mineral resources and mineral reserves are discussed in sections\n11 and 12, respectively, of each TRS.\nExploration Target\nBrook Mine is an exploration property that includes three drillhole programs involving a total of 123 new core\ndrillholes. Specifically, targeting REEs has been completed within the current Brook Mine permit area. So far, the results\nof these drilling programs indicate elevated levels of REEs, along with significant concentrations of other critical\nelements such as Yttrium, Gallium, and Germanium. Work is ongoing to evaluate the potential exploitation of these\nminerals within the current Brook Mine permit area.\nThere has been insufficient exploration of the Brook Mine to estimate a mineral resource and it is unclear, at\npresent, whether further exploration will result in the estimation of a mineral resource. The exploration target therefore\ndoes not represent, and should not be construed to be, an estimate of a mineral resource or mineral reserve as such terms\nare used in subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K.\n68\nTable of Contents\nInternal Controls\nIn our exploration and mineral resource and reserve estimation efforts, we utilize a certified American National\nStandards Institute third-party laboratory, which has in-house quality control and assurance procedures. Once in possession\nof the samples, the laboratory standard sample preparation and security procedures are followed. After the sample has\nbeen tested, reviewed, and accepted, the disposal of the sample is done in accordance with local, state and EPA approved\nmethods.\nWeir has determined the sample preparation, security and analysis procedures used for our drillhole samples meet\ncurrent coal industry standards and practices for quality testing, with laboratory results suitable to use for geological\nmodeling, mineral resource estimation and economic evaluation.\nYear-end reserve estimates are and will continue to be reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer and other senior\nmanagement, and revisions are communicated to our board of directors. Inaccuracies in our estimates of our coal reserves\ncould result in decreased profitability from lower-than-expected revenue or higher-than-expected costs. Actual production\nrecovered from identified reserve areas and properties, and revenue and expenditures associated with our mining\noperations, may vary materially from estimates.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nDue to the nature of our business, we may become, from time to time, involved in routine litigation or subject to\ndisputes or claims related to our business activities. In the opinion of our management, there are no pending litigation,\ndisputes or claims against us which, if decided adversely, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,\ncash flows or results of operations. For a description of our legal proceedings, see “Commitments and Contingencies,”\nNote 10 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nThe information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of\nthe Dodd-Frank Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K is included in Exhibit 95.1 to this Annual Report.\n69\nTable of Contents\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity and Related Shareholder Matters\nOn June 12, 2023, an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation was approved by\nshareholder vote to reclassify the Company’s existing common stock as shares of Class A common stock, par value\n$0.01 per share, and create a separate Class B common stock having a par value of $0.01 per share.\nThe initial distribution of Class B common stock occurred on June 21, 2023 via a stock dividend to existing\nholders of common stock as of May 12, 2023. On the date of initial distribution, each holder of common stock received\n0.2 shares of Class B common stock for every one share of existing common stock held on the record date.\nMarket Information. Our Class A and Class B common stock are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market\nunder the symbols “METC” and “METCB,” respectively, and our Notes are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select\nMarket under the symbol “METCL.”\nHolders. As of the close of business on February 29, 2024, there were 87 holders of record of our Class A\ncommon stock and 76 holders of record of our Class B common stock. Because many of our common shares are held\nby brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders\nrepresented by these holders of record.\nDividends. In addition to the stock dividend discussed above, the Company declared $27.5 million of total cash\ndividends during 2023, which includes $5.6 million under the Company’s single class structure, $17.0 million to Class\nA shareholders, and $3.6 million to Class B shareholders as well as $1.2 million of forfeitable dividends subject to the\nvesting conditions of outstanding restricted stock units and performance stock units.\nFor holders of Class A common stock, including common stock reclassified to Class A common stock, cash\ndividends were declared quarterly in the amount of $0.125 per share with the exception of the final quarterly dividend,\nwhich was declared in the amount of $0.1375 per share. The Company anticipates declaring cash dividends on a\nquarterly basis at the newly approved amount; however, future declarations of dividends are subject to Board of\nDirectors’ approval and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change.\nFor holders of Class B common stock, cash dividends were declared in the amount of $0.165 per share and\n$0.249 per share in the third and fourth quarter, respectively. In addition, the Company declared another quarterly cash\ndividend in February 2024, subsequent to the date of the financial statements, in the amount of $0.242 per share of Class\nB common stock. All cash dividends declared to date for Class B common stock were based on 20% of CORE royalty\nand infrastructure fees for the previous quarter. The Company anticipates continuing to declare quarterly cash dividends\nbased on 20% of CORE royalty and infrastructure fees; however, future declarations of dividends are subject to the sole\ndiscretion of the Company’s Board of Directors. In addition, the Board of Directors retains the power to change or add\nexpense allocation policies related to CORE, redefine CORE assets, and redetermine CORE’s per-ton usage fees at any\ntime without shareholder approval.\nIn regard to stock dividends, such as the initial non-cash distribution of Class B common stock discussed above,\nthere are currently no plans to declare additional dividends payable in stock.\nEquity Compensation Plans. The Company does not have any non-stockholder approved equity compensation\nplans. Refer to Part II, Item 8, Note 9 for the Company’s equity compensation plan information.\nStock repurchases. The Company routinely allows employees to surrender common stock that would be\nissuable upon the vesting or exercise of stock-based compensation awards to pay estimated taxes. The value of common\nstock surrendered by employees is determined based on the price of the Company’s common stock at the time of\nrelinquishment. There were no repurchases of common shares during the quarter or year ended December 31, 2023.\n70\nTable of Contents\nItem 6. [Reserved]\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present\nfinancial condition and contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected\nperformance. The forward-looking statements are dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties that may be outside\nour control. We caution you that our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking\nstatements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report,\nparticularly in the “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors,” all of which are\ndifficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not\noccur. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise\nrequired by applicable law.\nOverview\nOur primary source of revenue is the sale of metallurgical coal. We are a pure-play metallurgical coal company\nwith 59 million reserve tons and 1,119 million measured and indicated resource tons of high-quality metallurgical coal.\nOur plan is to continue development of our existing properties and grow annual production over the next few years to\napproximately seven million clean tons of metallurgical coal, subject to market conditions, permitting and additional\ncapital deployment in the medium-term. We may make acquisitions of reserves or infrastructure that continue our focus\non advantaged geology and lower costs.\nThe overall outlook of the metallurgical coal business is dependent on a variety of factors such as pricing,\nregulatory uncertainties and global economic conditions. Coal consumption and production in the U.S. is driven by\nseveral market dynamics and trends including the U.S. and global economies, the U.S. dollar’s strength relative to other\ncurrencies and accelerating production cuts. In addition, blast furnace steelmaking is more prevalent outside the U.S.\ncompared to domestic steel production, which creates demand for exports of metallurgical coal.\nAlthough conflicts overseas continue and economic growth remains uncertain in some regions of the world,\nsupply constraints continue to support the global metallurgical coal market overall. Ongoing bans on the import of\nRussian coal have affected the availability of supply to certain seaborne markets as well as contributed to volatility in\nprices.\nMetallurgical coal benchmark prices increased significantly in early 2022, but then fell throughout the rest of\nthe year. Market pricing for 2023 was generally down from 2022 levels but remains favorable versus long-term\naverages. We expect metallurgical coal prices to remain volatile in the near term. In addition, we anticipate that inflation\nmay remain high in the near term for steel prices, freight rates, labor, and materials, which would continue to negatively\naffect our profitability.\nDuring 2023, we sold 3.5 million tons of coal. North American markets made up 33% of our 2023 revenues and\nexport markets, excluding Canada, accounted for 67% of our 2023 revenues. The Company is responsible for rail and\nloadout costs for coal sold into export markets. During 2022, we sold 2.5 million tons of coal. North American markets\nmade up 58% of our 2022 revenues and export markets, excluding Canada, accounted for 42% of our 2022 revenues. We\npurchase coal from third parties for sale for our own account from time to time; however, sales of Company-produced\ncoal made up 95% and 98% of total sales in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe annual contracting season with North American steel producers generally occurs in late-summer through\nthe fall. As of December 31, 2023, we had entered into forward sales contracts with certain North American customers\non a fixed price basis for 1.4 million tons of coal at an average realizable price of $166 per ton, excluding freight. This\nlevel of pricing in 2023 is lower than the average price of $198 per ton that was obtained during the previous contracting\nseason for North America. This is due to a combination of factors, including changes in demand, variations in the types\nof coal qualities being purchased, fluctuations in steel prices, and other macroeconomic trends. The Company shifted to\n71\nTable of Contents\nmore export sales in the Company’s mix of revenues during 2023, which will likely continue into 2024. Export sales\noften contain index-based pricing and, therefore, greater volatility in pricing and revenues.\nIn 2023, our capital expenditures were $82.9 million, excluding capitalized interest of $1.1 million. In 2022, our\ncapital expenditures were $123.0 million, excluding cash paid for the acquisitions of Ramaco Coal and Maben Coal\nassets which totaled $23.6 million as well as capitalized interest of $1.1 million. The decrease in capital expenditures\nwas due to the Company’s progress related to strategic growth projects at our Elk Creek and Berwind mining complexes.\nWe completed the expansion of processing capacity at the Elk Creek preparation plant in 2023, which now has an\nannualized processing and shipping capacity of approximately three million tons per year.\nOn July 10, 2022, we experienced a methane ignition at the Berwind No. 1 mine, which was one of the active\nmines at our Berwind mining complex. There were no personnel in the mine at the time of the incident and no injuries or\nfatalities occurred. The overall impact to pre-tax earnings in 2022 was immaterial except for idle mine costs of $9.5\nmillion recognized during the year. The Company subsequently recognized other income of $8.1 million in 2023 related\nto insurance proceeds received for the event. Production from the Berwind No. 1 mine restarted in the first quarter of\n2023.\nAs a result of the increase in capacity at the Elk Creek plant, the re-opening of the Berwind No. 1 mine\ndescribed above, and the start of production at the Maben mine during 2023, the Company was producing just under an\nannualized four million tons per year run rate at the later part of 2023. The Company expects to produce between 4.0\nmillion and 4.4 million tons in 2024 depending on market conditions.\nOn June 21, 2023, the Company distributed Class B common stock, a tracking stock, to provide existing holders\nof the Company’s common stock an opportunity to participate directly in the financial performance of the Company’s\nCORE assets on a stand-alone basis, separate from the Company’s metallurgical coal operations. CORE assets were\nacquired initially by the Company as part of the Company’s acquisition of Ramaco Coal in the second quarter of 2022.\nThe financial performance of CORE assets consists of the following non-cost-bearing revenue streams based on the\nCompany’s current expectations:\n• Royalty fees derived from the royalties associated with the Ramaco Coal and Amonate reserves, which we\nbelieve approximates 3% of Company-produced coal sales revenue excluding coal sales revenue from Knox\nCreek,\n• Infrastructure fees based on $5.00 per ton of coal processed at our preparation plants and $2.50 per ton of\nloaded coal at the Company’s rail load-out facilities, and\n• Future income derived, if and when realized, from advanced carbon products and rare earth elements initiatives.\nThe Company anticipates paying a quarterly cash dividend equal to 20% of the total fees above; however, any\ndividend amounts declared and paid are subject to the sole discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors. Dividends\npaid on the tracking stock allow the Company to return to Class B common stockholders a portion of the savings from\nroyalties and infrastructure usage fees resulting from the acquisition of Ramaco Coal. In addition, the tracking stock\nprovides an opportunity for Class B common stockholders to participate directly in the potential revenue growth\nassociated with the development of carbon products and rare earth elements. The Company paid cash dividends on Class\nB common stock during the third and fourth quarter of 2023.\nSeparate financial statements for CORE have not been included as exhibits to this filing since CORE’s financial\nperformance and dividends will be evaluated based on non-cost-bearing revenue streams, at least initially, and other\npotential forms of passive income rather than reduced by allocated costs and expenses.\nThe Company continues to assess its potential REEs deposit in Wyoming. To date, the results of drilling\nprograms indicate elevated levels of REEs, along with significant concentrations of other critical elements such as\nYttrium, Gallium, and Germanium. The exploration target does not represent, and should not be construed to be, a\nmineral resource or mineral reserve as such terms are used in subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. The Company also\ncontinues its work to advance new carbon product technologies with the goal of commercializing products that use coal\nin both an improved economic and environmental manner.\n72\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nYears en d ed Decem b er 31,\n(In thousands, except per share amounts) 2023 2022 2021\nRevenue $ 693,524 $ 565,688 $ 283,394\nCosts and expenses\nCost of sales (exclusive of items shown separately below) 493,793 332,960 195,412\nAsset retirement obligations accretion 1,403 1,115 615\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization 54,252 41,194 26,205\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 48,831 40,032 21,629\nTotal costs and expenses 598,279 415,301 243,861\nOperating income 95,245 150,387 39,533\nOther income (expense), net 18,321 2,637 7,429\nInterest expense, net (8,903) (6,829) (2,556)\nIncome before tax 104,663 146,195 44,406\nIncome tax expense 22,350 30,153 4,647\nNet income $ 82,313 $ 116,042 $ 39,759\nEarnings per common share\nBasic - Single class (through 6/20/2023) $ 0.71 $ 2.63 $ 0.90\nBasic - Class A (6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023) $ 1.06 $ — $ —\nTotal $ 1.77 $ 2.63 $ 0.90\nBasic - Class B (6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023) $ 0.42 $ — $ —\nDiluted - Single class (through 6/20/23) $ 0.70 $ 2.60 $ 0.90\nDiluted - Class A (6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023) $ 1.03 $ — $ —\nTotal $ 1.73 $ 2.60 $ 0.90\nDiluted - Class B (6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023) $ 0.40 $ — $ —\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 182,126 $ 204,555 $ 79,042\nNet income and Adjusted EBITDA were lower in 2023 compared to 2022, despite the increase in sales volume,\ndue to lower sales pricing and higher cost per ton sold in 2023. Net income and Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 benefitted\nfrom $15.9 million of pre-tax income for proceeds received from insurance claims related to the 2022 Berwind ignition\nevent and 2018 silo failure. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for an explanation of the Company’s\ncalculation of Adjusted EBITDA.\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022\nRevenue. Our revenue includes sales to customers of Company-produced coal as well as smaller amounts of\ncoal purchased from third parties. We include amounts billed by us for transportation to our customers within revenue\nand transportation costs incurred within cost of sales.\n73\nTable of Contents\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we had revenue of $693.5 million from the sale of 3.5 million tons of\ncoal. During 2022, we sold 2.5 million tons of coal for total revenue of $565.7 million.\nCoal sales information is summarized below:\nYea r e nd ed Decemb er 31 ,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 Increase\nRevenue:\nCompany Produced\nCoal sales revenue $ 657,090 $ 553,830 $ 103,260\nTons sold 3,299 2,396 903\nCompany-produced revenue per ton sold (GAAP) $ 199 $ 231 $ (32)\nPurchased from Third Parties\nCoal sales revenue $ 36,434 $ 11,858 $ 24,576\nTons sold 156 54 102\nPurchased coal revenue per ton sold (GAAP) $ 234 $ 220 $ 14\nTotals\nCoal sales revenue $ 693,524 $ 565,688 $ 127,836\nTons sold 3,455 2,450 1,005\nTotal revenue per ton sold (GAAP) $ 201 $ 231 $ (30)\nCost of Sales:\nCompany Produced\nCost of sales $ 468,992 $ 323,550 $ 145,442\nTons sold 3,299 2,396 903\nCompany-produced cost of sales per ton sold (GAAP) $ 142 $ 135 $ 7\nPurchased from Third Parties\nCost of sales $ 24,801 $ 9,410 $ 15,391\nTons sold 156 54 102\nPurchased coal cost of sales per ton sold (GAAP) $ 159 $ 174 $ (15)\nTotals\nCost of sales $ 493,793 $ 332,960 $ 160,833\nTons sold 3,455 2,450 1,005\nTotal cost of sales per ton sold (GAAP) $ 143 $ 136 $ 7\nRefer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for supplemental calculations of\nrevenue per ton sold (FOB mine) and cash cost per ton sold (FOB mine)\nCoal sales revenue for 2023 increased 23% from 2022, which was driven by the 41% increase in tons sold. The\nincrease in sales volume was due to greater export sales and was aided by the Company’s increased capacity for\nproduction achieved during 2023. Revenue per ton sold decreased 13% from $231 per ton in 2022 to $201 per ton in\n2023. Revenue per ton sold (FOB mine), a non-GAAP measure which excludes transportation revenues and demurrage,\ndecreased 18% from $207 per ton in 2022 to $170 per ton in 2023 including company-produced coal and purchased coal.\nThe decrease in both revenue per ton sold measures in 2023 was driven by the variability in index-based pricing for\nexport sales.\nRefer to Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Concentrations and Note 11—Revenues in\nItem 8, Part II for additional information regarding sales to customers.\nCost of sales. Our cost of sales increased 48% from 2022, which was driven by the increase in tons sold\ndiscussed above. Cost of sales per ton sold increased 5% from $136 per ton in 2022 to $143 per ton in 2023. Cash cost\nper ton sold (FOB mine), a non-GAAP measure which excludes transportation costs and idle mine costs, increased 3%\nfrom $108 per ton in 2022 to $111 per ton in 2023, including company-produced coal and purchased coal. The increase\nin both cost per ton sold measures in 2023 was primarily due to inflationary pressures on labor and supplies.\n74\nTable of Contents\nAsset retirement obligation accretion. ARO accretion was $1.4 million for 2023 and $1.1 million for 2022. The\nhigher level of accretion in 2023 was driven primarily by changes in estimates of future cash flows.\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense totaled $54.3\nmillion in 2023 compared to $41.2 million in 2022. The increase in 2023 occurred across all asset classes consistent with\nthe Company’s initiative to grow production.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $48.8 million\nfor 2023 compared to $40.0 million for 2022. The 22% increase in 2023 was primarily due to greater compensation-\nrelated expenses and headcount as well as increased spending for professional services consistent with the Company’s\ngrowth efforts.\nOther income (expense), net. Other income, net was $18.3 million in 2023 compared to $2.6 million in 2022.\nThe activity in 2023 was related mostly to insurance proceeds received in 2023 related to the 2022 Berwind ignition\nevent that occurred in 2022 and the silo failure that occurred in 2018. The Company received proceeds of $17.0 million\nduring 2023 and had accrued a recovery asset of $1.1 million in the previous period; thus, a gain of $15.9 million was\nrecognized in 2023. This activity is not indicative of expected future results. The activity in 2022 was driven by the gain\nof $2.1 million recognized on the sale of mineral rights.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net was approximately $8.9 million in 2023 as compared to $6.8 million\nin 2022. The increase in net interest expense in 2023 was primarily due to increased use of the revolving credit facility\nduring 2023.\nIncome tax expense. We recognized income tax expense of $22.4 million and $30.2 million in 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. The lower amount in 2023 was largely due to the decrease in income before taxes. Refer to Note 13 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part I in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for an explanation of\ndifferences versus the statutory rate of 21%.\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021\nPlease see Part I, Item 7, \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations\" in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the results of operation for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure by management\nand external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. We\nbelieve Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus net interest expense; stock-based compensation; depreciation,\ndepletion, and amortization expenses; income taxes; certain non-operating expenses (charitable contributions); and\naccretion of asset retirement obligations. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA is included below.\n75\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted EBITDA is not intended to serve as a substitute to U.S. GAAP measures of performance and may not be\ncomparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies.\nYears en d ed Decemb er 3 1,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA\nNet income $ 82,313 $ 116,042 $ 39,759\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization 54,252 41,194 26,205\nInterest expense, net 8,903 6,829 2,556\nIncome tax expense 22,350 30,153 4,647\nEBITDA 167,818 194,218 73,167\nStock-based compensation 12,905 8,222 5,260\nOther non-operating expenses — 1,000 —\nAccretion of asset retirement obligation 1,403 1,115 615\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 182,126 $ 204,555 $ 79,042\nNon-GAAP revenue per ton sold. Non-GAAP revenue per ton sold (FOB mine) is calculated as coal sales\nrevenue less transportation revenues and demurrage, divided by tons sold. We believe revenue per ton (FOB mine)\nprovides useful information to investors as it enables investors to compare revenue per ton we generate against similar\nmeasures made by other publicly-traded coal companies and more effectively monitor changes in coal prices from period\nto period excluding the impact of transportation costs which are beyond our control. The adjustments made to arrive at\nthese measures are significant in understanding and assessing our financial performance.

The Company expects to satisfy\napproximately 88% of these commitments in 2024 and the remainder in 2025. Sales commitments of another 0.4 million\ntons were obtained subsequent to December 31, 2023 for delivery in 2024. We expect the shift to more export sales in\nthe Company’s mix of revenue that occurred in 2023 to continue during 2024, which may lead to volatility in revenues\ndue to index-based pricing.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary source of cash is proceeds from the sale of our coal production to customers. Our primary uses of\ncash include the cash costs of coal production, capital expenditures, acquisitions, royalty payments, and other operating\nexpenditures.\nCash flow information is as follows:\nYea rs en ded Decemb er 3 1,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nConsolidated statement of cash flow data:\nCash flows provided by operating activities $ 161,036 $ 187,870 $ 53,340\nCash flows used for investing activities (72,211) (145,708) (59,613)\nCash flows (used for) provided by financing activities (82,517) (28,495) 22,369\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 6,308 $ 13,667 $ 16,096\nCash flows provided by operating activities during 2023 decreased $26.8 million versus the prior year driven by\nlower cash earnings. Changes in operating assets and liabilities were favorable versus the prior year due to a variety of\nfactors, most notably, variations in income tax payments as the Company received an $11.8 million refund in 2023.\nNet cash used for investing activities during 2023 decreased $73.5 million versus the prior year primarily due to\nlower capital expenditures and acquisition-related activity of $40.1 million and $22.2 million, respectively. The decrease\nin capital expenditures was due to the Company’s progress related to strategic growth projects at our Elk Creek and\nBerwind mining complexes. The strategic acquisitions Maben Coal and Ramaco Coal, as well as the concurrent sale of\nmineral rights, took place in 2022 and no such transactions occurred in 2023. In addition, the Company received $11.2\nmillion of insurance proceeds during 2023 related to property, plant, and equipment claims from the 2022 Berwind\nignition event and 2018 silo failure.\n77\nTable of Contents\nNet cash used for financing activities was $54.0 million higher in 2023 versus 2022, which was driven by\ngreater repayment of debts and similar financings including $25.0 million and $9.6 million related to the Ramaco Coal\nand Maben Coal asset acquisitions, respectively. In addition, the Company also paid $5.8 million more cash dividends\nduring 2023, which was largely due to $3.6 million of cash dividends paid on Class B common stock that was initially\ndistributed in 2023, as part of the Company’s strategy to increase value for its shareholders. The Company declared an\nadditional quarterly cash dividend for holders of Class B common stock in February 2024, subsequent to the date of the\nfinancial statements, in the amount of $0.242 per share of Class B common stock.\nAll cash dividends declared to date for Class B common stock were based on 20% of CORE royalty and\ninfrastructure fees for the previous quarter as shown below.\nThree months ended Three months ended T hree months ended\nDecember 31, September 30, June 30,\n(In thousands) 2023 2023 2023\nRoyalties\nRamaco Coal $ 3,276 $ 3,572 $ 1,351\nAmonate Assets 722 614 752\nOther 14 13 —\nTotal Royalties $ 4,012 $ 4,199 $ 2,103\nInfrastructure Fees\nPreparation Plants (Processing at $5.00/ton) $ 4,432 $ 4,521 $ 3,433\nRail Load-outs (Loading at $2.50/ton) 2,198 2,202 1,726\nTotal Infrastructure Fees (at $7.50/ton) $ 6,630 $ 6,723 $ 5,159\nCORE Royalty and Infrastructure Fees $ 10,642 $ 10,922 $ 7,262\nTotal Cash Available for Dividend for Class B\nCommon Stock $ 10,642 $ 10,922 $ 7,262\n20% of Cash Available for Dividend for Class B\nCommon Stock $ 2,128 $ 2,184 $ 1,452\nRestricted cash balances at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $0.8 million and $0.9 million,\nrespectively, and consisted of funds held in escrow for potential future workers’ compensation claims.

Our indebtedness was comprised of $42.5 million of outstanding borrowings under the\nRevolving Credit Facility, $34.5 million of Senior Notes ($33.3 million net of unamortized discounts and issuance\ncosts), $11.4 million of unpaid financing related to the Maben Coal assets acquisition, and $3.0 of various equipment\nloans. Of these amounts, $56.5 million is expected to be repaid in 2024, including $42.5 million of revolver borrowings\nthat were repaid shortly after the balance sheet date using funds from current operations and $11.4 million of acquisition\nfinancing that is contractually due in 2024. The remaining amount of $34.9 million, or $33.7 net of unamortized\ndiscounts and issuance costs, is mostly comprised of the Senior Notes due in 2026.\n78\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s outstanding debt decreased approximately $37.0 million in 2023 and was due primarily to the\nrepayment of financing associated with the previous acquisitions of Ramaco Coal and Maben Coal in the amount of\n$40.0 million and $9.6 million, respectively. The Company’s outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit\nFacility increased $17.5 million compared to 2022.\nThe acquisition of Ramaco Coal helps to reduce royalty expenses associated with the Company’s metallurgical\noperations in the Appalachian basin and, along with the acquisition of Maben Coal, complement our existing low-vol\nportfolio, both of which help achieve the Company’s objective of remaining among the lowest cost producers of\nmetallurgical coal in the U.S. In addition, the acquisition of Ramaco Coal includes potential concentrations of rare earth\nelements and is being used to support the Company’s possible expansion into the manufacture and commercialization of\nadvanced carbon products and materials from coal, both of which provide additional growth opportunities in the future.\nThe financing associated with the acquisition of Ramaco Coal, which was provided by a related party, was repaid in full\nduring 2023.\nRevolver borrowings are typically used for the management of our normal operating cash position. Revolver\nborrowings that were outstanding at December 31, 2023 were repaid in full during January 2024.\nIn addition to the debts discussed above, the Company finances the payment of premiums associated with\nvarious insurance policies. The Company’s liability at December 31, 2023 was $4.0 million, which must be repaid in\n2024.\nThe Company also has various finance leases for mining equipment, which generally include terms from three\nto five years. The Company’s total liability for finance leases at December 31, 2023 was $10.4 million, which includes\n$5.5 million due in 2024 and $4.9 million due thereafter.\nRefer to Notes 7 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part I in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for additional information on indebtedness and leases.\nLiquidity\nAs of December 31, 2023, our available liquidity was $90.6 million, comprised of $42.0 million of cash and\ncash equivalents and $48.6 million of availability under the Revolving Credit Facility for future borrowings. Total\ncurrent assets were in excess of total current liabilities, which included $42.5 million of revolver borrowings repaid in\nJanuary 2024, by $19.7 million. The Company is party to an arrangement that began in 2023 whereby our cash and cash\nequivalents are placed at various banks in amounts no greater than the $250,000 FDIC-insured limit to help safeguard\nagainst potential losses in the financial sector. The Revolving Credit facility, which includes multiple lending parties and\nhas a maturity date of February 15, 2026, provides added flexibility to the Company to pursue our strategic growth\ninitiatives and manage our normal operating cash position as well as withstand potential changes in macroeconomic\nconditions.\nThe terms of the Revolving Credit facility include covenants limiting the ability of the Company to incur\nadditional indebtedness, make investments or loans, incur liens, consummate mergers and similar fundamental changes,\nmake restricted payments, and enter into transactions with affiliates. The terms of the facility also require the Company\nto maintain certain covenants, including fixed charge ratio and compensating balance requirements. A fixed charge\ncoverage ratio of not less than 1.10:1.00, calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, must be maintained by the\nCompany. In addition, the Company must maintain an average daily cash balance of $5 million, as determined on a\nmonthly basis, in a dedicated account as well as an additional $1 million in a separate dedicated account to assure future\ncredit availability. At December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all debt covenants under the Revolving Credit\nFacility.\nOur primary use of cash includes capital expenditures for mine development, infrastructure, and equipment as\nwell as ongoing operating expenses and repayment of financing associated with previous acquisitions. As of the date of\nthis Annual Report, we expect to fund our capital and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months and the\nreasonably foreseeable future with cash on hand, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, and projected cash\n79\nTable of Contents\nflows from operations. Factors that could adversely impact our future liquidity and ability to carry out our capital\nexpenditure program include the following:\n• Timely delivery of our product by rail and other transportation carriers;\n• Late payments of accounts receivable by our customers;\n• Cost overruns in our purchases of equipment needed to complete our mine development plans;\n• Delays in completion of development of our various mines, processing plants and refuse disposal facilities,\nwhich would reduce the coal we would have available to sell and our cash flow from operations; and\n• Adverse changes in the metallurgical coal markets that would reduce the expected cash flow from operations.\nIf future cash flows were to become insufficient to meet our liquidity needs or capital requirements, due to\nchanges in macroeconomic conditions or otherwise, we may reduce our expected level of capital expenditures for new\nmine production and/or fund a portion of our capital expenditures through the issuance of debt or equity securities, new\ndebt arrangements, or from other sources such as asset sales.\nOn September 1, 2023, the Company filed a shelf registration statement to sell any combination of Class A\ncommon stock, Class B common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities, warrants, and rights at an\naggregate initial offering price of up to $400.0 million, which was declared effective on September 29, 2023. However,\nthe Company has no specific plans to raise capital at this time and no securities may be sold until a prospectus\nsupplement describing the method and terms of any future offering is delivered.\nIn March 2024, Ramaco initiated actions to extend the maturity date and increase the size of its existing\nRevolver facility. The Company is targeting a $200 million facility with a $75 million accordion feature and a maturity\ndate of five years from the closing date. The Company hopes to achieve a successful syndication of the new facility\nduring the second quarter of 2024, which would strengthen our liquidity and provide additional flexibility in support of\nthe Company’s strategic initiatives and operations.\nWorking Capital\nAccounts receivable were $96.9 million at December 31, 2023, which increased $55.7 million versus December\n31, 2022 driven by the $67.5 million increase in fourth quarter revenues. Inventories were $37.2 million at December 31,\n2023, which decreased $7.8 million versus December 31, 2022 driven by the logistical and rail challenges we\nexperienced in 2022. Accounts payable were $51.6 million at December 31, 2023, up from December 31, 2022 due to\nincreased spending.\nCapital Requirements\nDuring 2022 we spent $123.0 million for capital additions, over 75% of which related to ongoing growth\nprojects, including the increase in capacity to accommodate higher production levels at the Elk Creek and Berwind\nmining complexes. During 2023 the Company spent $82.9 million on capital additions, a significantly lower amount\nversus 2022, as the Company has made substantial progress in achieving its growth initiatives.\nWe anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $53-63 million in 2024, which will likely be weighted\nmore toward maintenance capital than growth capital and development projects. The shift toward maintenance capital is\ndue to the Company’s substantial investments in growth projects in previous periods and its progress to date regarding\nthese initiatives. Despite this shift, it should be noted that the Company entered into an agreement during February 2024\nto purchase preparation plant assets for the Maben Complex at a price of $3 million. The Company anticipates spending\nan additional $8 million in capital expenditures related to the plant in 2024. These assets will be relocated to the Maben\nComplex and reassembled there for future use with the purpose of reducing the cost of transporting current raw coal\nproduction. These assets will also provide the Company with a preparation facility to handle additional future production\nfrom a deep mine complex at Maben should the Company decide in the future to pursue such development.\n80\nTable of Contents\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2023:\nPaym e n ts due by p er io d\n2 – 3 4 – 5 More than 5\n(In thousands) Total 1 year years years years\nMinimum coal lease and royalty obligations $ 27,195 $ 3,358 $ 6,486 $ 6,316 $ 11,035\nDebt, excluding interest 91,383 56,534 34,849 — —\nInsurance financing 4,037 4,037 — — —\nLeases 11,940 6,075 3,953 1,912 —\nTake-or-pay obligations 20,237 5,612 9,000 5,625 —\nTotal $ 154,792 $ 75,616 $ 54,288 $ 13,853 $ 11,035\nMinimum royalties represent the contractual minimum amounts to be paid monthly, quarterly or annually for\nthe right to access mineral properties and mine certain reserves and resources. The amounts are generally recoupable\nagainst future production royalties to be paid.\nRefer to the previous discussion of Indebtedness above for additional information regarding the Company’s\noutstanding debt, insurance financing, and finance leases. Leases payments in the table above include payments for both\nfinancing and operating leases.\nTake-or-pay obligations represent those liquidated damage obligations as determined by contract volume\nminimums for transportation of coal at the representative rates of transportation or a portion thereof. Additional take-or-\npay commitments for the next annual period were renewed after the balance sheet date and have been excluded from the\ntable above. These commitments are estimated at approximately $14 million based on last year’s average rate.\nAsset retirement obligations have been excluded from the table above. Accounting for asset retirement\nobligations requires a number of estimates, including the amount and timing of payments to satisfy the obligation. The\ntotal liability recognized on the Company’s balance sheet for asset retirement obligations was $29.0 million at December\n31, 2023. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below as well as Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in Item 8 of Part I in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nEstimated payments related to worker’s compensation and occupational disease obligations have also been\nexcluded from the table above. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below for additional information\nrelated to these obligations. Refer also to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part I in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements, such as bank letters\nof credit and performance or surety bonds. Liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in consolidated\nbalance sheets, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations, or\ncash flows to result from these arrangements. We primarily use surety bonds to secure our financial obligations related to\nreclamation and other matters. Total surety bonds at December 31, 2023, were $27.2 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent\nassets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amounts of revenue and expenses\nreported for the period then ended.\n81\nTable of Contents\nCoal Reserves. Our coal reserves and resources are generally updated on an annual basis. There are numerous\nuncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of coal reserves and resources, including many factors beyond\nour control. As a result, estimates of coal reserves and resources are by their nature uncertain. Information about our\nreserves and resources consists of estimates based on engineering, economic, and geological data assembled by third-\nparty qualified persons. Information used to determine recoverable reserves and resources include geological conditions,\nhistorical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas, assumed effects of regulations\nand taxes by governmental agencies, assumptions governing future prices, and future operating costs. Each of these may\nin fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves and resources. For these reasons, estimates of\neconomically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties, and classification of these\nreserves and resources based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows, may vary substantially. Actual\nproduction, revenues, and expenditures with respect to reserves and resources will likely vary from estimates and these\nvariances may be material. Variances could affect our projected future revenues and expenditures, valuation of coal\nreserves and resources, and amortization and depletion of mine development costs and mineral rights.\nAsset Retirement Obligations. We initially recognize as a liability an asset retirement obligation, or ARO,\nassociated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset in the period in which it is incurred or a reasonable estimate\nof fair value can be made, with an associated increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The initially\nrecognized asset retirement cost is amortized using the same method and useful life as the long-lived asset to which it\nrelates. Accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value.\nThe liability is reduced as the reclamation work is performed and the related costs are applied.\nEstimating the ARO requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding timing and existence of a\nliability, as well as what constitutes adequate restoration. Inherent in the fair value calculation are numerous assumptions\nand judgments including the ultimate costs, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, and the timing of the related\ncash flows. On at least an annual basis, we review our ARO liabilities and make necessary adjustments for significant\nincreases in disturbed acreage, mining permit changes, significant mine plan revisions, and changes in cost estimates or\ntiming of performance. To the extent future revisions are made to the ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made\nto the related asset.\nOur ARO liabilities at December 31, 2023 were nearly flat versus December 31, 2022 as the accretion of the\nliability during the year and the downward revision to estimates were mostly offsetting. We lowered our inflation per\nyear assumption from 3.75% used in 2022 to 3% in 2023 based on macroeconomic trends. If our assumptions differ from\nactual experience, or if changes in the regulatory environment occur, our actual cash expenditures and costs that we\nincur could be materially different than currently estimated.\nOccupational Disease (Pneumoconiosis) Obligations. We recognize as a liability to provide for occupational\nillness (pneumoconiosis) benefits to eligible employees, former employees and dependents as required by the Mine Act.\nThe occupational illness benefit obligation represents the present value of the actuarially computed liabilities for such\nbenefits over the employees’ applicable years of service.\nEstimating the future occupational disease (pneumoconiosis) benefits requires management to make estimates\nand judgments regarding timing and existence of a liability utilizing third-party actuaries to assist in preparing what\nconstitutes adequate liability amounts. Inherent in the calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the\nultimate costs, mortality factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, and timing of settlement. These estimates are subject to\nuncertainty due to a variety of factors, including limited Ramaco-specific claim volume and future cost trends. As a\nresult, volatility in future estimates may occur and actual costs could differ significantly from the estimated amounts.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets. We review our held-and-used long-lived assets for impairment whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable.\nAssets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash\nflows of other groups of assets, which is generally at the mine level or at the mining complex level for mines that share\ninfrastructure and/or developed access. Additional judgment may be required for development properties.\n82\nTable of Contents\nEvents and circumstances that may trigger a recoverability assessment include, but are not limited to, a current\nexpectation that a long-lived asset will be disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life,\na significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset or asset group is being used or in the\nphysical condition of the asset(s), and an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected.\nWe generally do not view short-term declines in metallurgical coal prices as a triggering event for conducting\nimpairment tests because of historic price volatility. In addition, a temporary idling of operations at a particular mine or\ncomplex may or may not be viewed as a triggering event depending on the remaining life of the mine, the length of time\nthe mine is expected to be idle, and the amount of incremental costs expected to resume operations.\nWhen events or changes in circumstances occur that trigger a recoverability test, the test is performed by\ncomparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its\ncarrying amount. If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is\nrecorded for the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group, if any.\nWe make various assumptions, including assumptions regarding future cash flows in our assessments of long-\nlived assets for impairment. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the current and long-\nterm business plans related to the long-lived assets.\nIncome Taxes. We are required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the\ndeferred income tax liabilities and assets for future consequences of events that have been reflected in our financial\nstatements or tax returns for each tax paying jurisdiction in which we operate. This process requires management to\nmake judgments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact of various agreements and transactions.\nWe initially recognize the effects of a tax position when it is more than 50% likely, based on the technical merits that the\nposition will be sustained upon examination. Our determination of whether or not a tax position has met the recognition\nthreshold depends on the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date.\nWe provide for deferred income taxes for temporary differences arising from differences between the financial\nstatement and tax basis of assets and liabilities existing at each balance sheet date using enacted tax rates. A valuation\nallowance may be recorded to reflect the amount of future tax benefits that management believes are not likely to be\nrealized. The assessment takes into account expectations of future taxable income or loss, available tax planning\nstrategies and the reversal of temporary differences. The development of these expectations involves the use of estimates\nsuch as production levels, operating profitability, timing of development activities and the cost and timing of reclamation\nwork. If actual outcomes differ from our expectations, we may record an additional valuation allowance through income\ntax expense in the period such determination is made. The Company had no valuation allowance at December 31, 2023.\nActual income taxes could vary from the estimates and judgments above due to future changes in income tax\nlaw, significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate, our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income,\nor unpredicted results from the final determination of each year’s liability by taxing authorities. These changes could\nhave a significant impact on our financial position.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—\nNote 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Recent Accounting Pronouncements.”\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk\nIn addition to the risks inherent in operations, we are exposed to financial, market, political and economic risks.\nThe following discussion provides additional detail regarding our exposure to the risks related to changes in commodity\nprices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.\nCommodity Price Risk. Our primary product is metallurgical coal, which is in itself a commodity. Sales\ncommitments in the metallurgical coal market are typically not long-term in nature. The Company’s domestic sales\ncontracts have terms of about one year and the pricing is typically fixed. Export sales have spot or term contracts, and\npricing is often derived from an index. As such, we are exposed to changes in the international price of metallurgical\ncoal.\n83\nTable of Contents\nOur sales commitments as of February 29, 2024 are as follows:\n20 24\nVolume Average Price\nNorth America, fixed priced 1.5 $ 167\nSeaborne, fixed priced 0.2 $ 159\nTotal, fixed priced 1.7 $ 166\nIndex priced 2.2\nTotal committed tons 3.9\nSales commitments of 0.4 million tons were obtained subsequent to December 31, 2023, which are included in\nthe table above.\nSales commitments in the metallurgical coal market are typically not long-term in nature and, therefore, we are\nsubject to fluctuations in market pricing. We expect the shift to more export sales in the Company’s mix of revenue that\noccurred in 2023 to continue during 2024, which may lead to volatility in revenues due to index-based pricing. The\nCompany does not currently manage this risk through the use of derivative instruments. We also have exposure to price\nrisk for supplies that are used directly or indirectly in the normal course of production such as diesel fuel, explosives,\nand other items. The Company manages its risk for these items through strategic sourcing contracts in normal quantities\nwith our suppliers.\nInterest Rate Risk. We are exposed to risk from changes in interest rates; however, based on the current levels\nof debt and leases, the Company does not attempt to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. we are not overly\nexposed to interest rate risk. The Company has senior unsecured notes with a face value of $34.5 million that mature on\nJuly 30, 2026, unless redeemed prior to maturity, bearing interest at a fixed rate of 9% per annum and paid quarterly.\nSome of the Company’s debts may be affected by changes in benchmark interest rates, such as the Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). Borrowings under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility, which has a maturity\ndate of February 15, 2026, bear interest at either a base rate plus 1.5% or the applicable SOFR plus 2%. The base rate\nequals the highest of the administrative agent’s prime rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5%, or 3%. The\nCompany’s outstanding financing related to the Maben coal acquisition, which had a balance of $11.4 million at\nDecember 31, 2023 and is due in full in 2024, bears interest at the applicable SOFR plus 3% compounded monthly.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk. International sales of coal are typically denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result,\nwe do not have direct exposure to currency valuation exchange rate fluctuations. However, because our coal is sold\ninternationally, to the extent that the U.S. dollar strengthens against the foreign currency of a customer or potential\ncustomer, we may find our coal at a price disadvantage as compared with other non-U.S. suppliers. This could lead to\nour receiving lower prices or being unable to compete for that specific customer’s business. Consequently, currency\nfluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal in international markets.\n84\nTable of Contents\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID 677) 86\nConsolidated Balance Sheets 92\nConsolidated Statements of Operations 93\nConsolidated Statements of Equity 94\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows 95\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements 96\n85\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and\nStockholders of Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nLexington, Kentucky\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ramaco Resources, Inc. (the “Company”)\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, equity, and cash\nflows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively\nreferred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated March 14, 2024,\nexpressed an adverse opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting\nfirm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws, and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we\nplan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the\nrisks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate\nto accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in\nany way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or\ndisclosures to which they relate.\nCritical Audit Matter – Asset Retirement Obligation Description\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company's asset retirement obligation (\"ARO\") liabilities totaled $29.0 million.\nAs discussed in Note 2 and Note 5 to the financial statements, the Company estimates its ARO liabilities for\nfinal reclamation based upon detailed engineering calculations of the amount and timing of the future cash\nspending for a third party to perform the required work. The Company records an ARO asset associated with\nthe discounted liability for final reclamation. The obligation and corresponding asset are recognized in the period\n86\nTable of Contents\nin which the liability is incurred. As changes in estimates occur, the revisions to the obligation and asset are\nrecognized at the appropriate credit-adjusted, risk-free rate.\nWe identified the valuation of the asset retirement obligation as a critical audit matter because the estimate\ninvolves a high degree of subjectivity and auditing the significant assumptions utilized by management in\nestimating the amount of the liability requires judgment. In particular, the obligation is determined using a\ndiscounted cash flow technique and is based upon mining permit requirements and various assumptions\nincluding discount rates, inflation rate, estimates of disturbed acreage and reclamation activities, timing of\nreclamation activities, and third-party reclamation costs.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit\nOur principal audit procedures performed to address this critical audit matter included the following:\n• We evaluated the methodology used, and tested the significant assumptions discussed above and the\nunderlying data used by the Company in its estimate.\n• We compared assumptions including the credit-adjusted risk-free rate and inflation rate to current market\ndata. In addition, to assess the estimates of disturbed acreage, timing of reclamation activities, and\nreclamation costs, we evaluated significant changes from the prior estimate.\n• We utilized an external specialist to assist in our assessment of the Company's ARO liability. As part of\nthis effort, the specialist performed a selected observation of mine site operations, interviewed\nmanagement’s engineering specialist, assessed the completeness of the mine reclamation estimate with\nrespect to meeting mine closure and post closure plan regulatory requirements by comparing costs to\npermits on selected sites, and evaluated the reasonableness of the engineering estimates and\nassumptions.\nCritical Audit Matter – Class B Common Stock Distribution Description\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company created a separate Class B common stock as\ndiscussed in Note 9 of the financial statements. An initial distribution of this Class B common stock occurred\non June 21, 2023, via a stock dividend to existing holders of common stock as of May 12, 2023. At the date of\ndistribution, each holder of common stock received 0.2 shares of Class B common stock for every one share\nof existing common stock held on the record date. Similar actions or modifications occurred for holders of\noutstanding stock-based awards. The holders of the Class B shares have different dividend expectations that\nare subject to the sole discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors. Also, the Class B shares do not\nrepresent a direct interest in a separate legal entity or direct interest in specific assets.\nThe accounting for this distribution and its effect on other areas of financial reporting involved complex\naccounting considerations including interpretive guidance. The magnitude of the transaction and uniqueness\nof the characteristics of the Class B shares required significant research and judgment regarding accounting\nand disclosure conclusions.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter was Addressed in the Audit\nOur principal audit procedures performed to address this critical audit matter included the following:\n• We read the related agreements and analyzed the terms of the Class B equity transaction.\n• We evaluated management’s interpretation and application of the relevant accounting guidance in\nrelation to the facts and circumstances involved and the conclusions reached regarding the accounting\ntreatment for this transaction.\n• We evaluated the disclosures surrounding the Class B shares and rights, earnings per share, and fair\nvalue, to ensure these were disclosed in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance.\n87\nTable of Contents\n/s/ Cherry Bekaert LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2022 (such date takes into account the acquisition of\nMCM CPAs & Advisors LLP by Cherry Bekaert LLP effective October 31, 2023)\nLouisville, Kentucky\nMarch 14, 2024\n88\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and\nStockholders of Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nLexington, Kentucky\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Ramaco Resources, Inc.’s (the “Company’s”) internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013) issued by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, because\nof the effect of the material weakness described in the following paragraph on the achievement of the objectives\nof the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013) issued by\nCOSO.\nA material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial\nreporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or\ninterim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness\nhas been identified and included in management’s assessment. Management identified a material weakness\nrelated to a pervasive lack of sufficient documentation of accounting policies, procedures, and controls. This\nlack of sufficient documentation does not allow management to effectively assess its relevant risks and key\ncontrols to properly test for design and operating effectiveness. This material weakness was considered in\ndetermining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2023 financial statements,\nand this report does not affect our report dated March 14, 2024, on those financial statements.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of\noperations, equity, and cash flows of the Company, and our report dated March 14, 2024, expressed an\nunqualified opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,\nand for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the\naccompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A–Controls\nand Procedures in the Company’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express an opinion\non the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan\nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included\nobtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material\nweakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based\non the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary\nin the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial\n89\nTable of Contents\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;\n(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of\nthe company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial\nstatements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Cherry Bekaert LLP\nLouisville, Kentucky\nMarch 14, 2024\n90\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nStockholders and the Board of Directors of Ramaco Resources, Inc.\nLexington, Kentucky\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, equity, and cash flows of Ramaco Resources,\nInc. (the “Company”) for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial\nstatements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the results of the Company’s\noperations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion\non the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether\ndue to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control\nover financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial\nreporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

(the “Company,” “Ramaco,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a Delaware corporation formed in\nOctober 2016. Our principal corporate and executive offices are located in Lexington, Kentucky with operational offices\nin Charleston, West Virginia and Sheridan, Wyoming. We are an operator and developer of high-quality, low-cost\nmetallurgical coal in southern West Virginia and southwestern Virginia. We believe each of these properties possesses\ngeologic and logistical advantages that make our coal among the lowest delivered-cost U.S. metallurgical coal to our\ndomestic target customer base, North American blast furnace steel mills and coke plants, as well as international\nmetallurgical coal consumers. We also control mineral deposits near Sheridan, Wyoming as part of the Company’s\ninitiatives regarding the potential recovery of rare earth elements as well as the potential commercialization of coal-to-\ncarbon-based products and materials.\nAlthough conflicts overseas continue and global economic growth remains uncertain, supply constraints support\nthe global metallurgical coal market. Ongoing bans on the import of Russian coal have affected the availability of supply\nto certain seaborne markets as well as contributed to volatility in coal prices.\nNOTE 2—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation—The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been\nprepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”)\nand U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. The financial statements are presented on a consolidated\nbasis for all periods presented. All significant intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities have\nbeen eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior year amounts in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements have\nbeen adjusted to conform to current presentation.\nUse of estimates—The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue\nand expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant\nestimates are related to the quantity and value of coal inventories, stock-based compensation, asset retirement\nobligations, occupational disease obligations, evaluation of long-lived assets for impairment, quantities and values of\ncoal reserves, depletion and amortization, useful lives, and income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition—Our primary source of revenue is from the sale of coal through contracts with steel\nproducers usually having durations of less than one year. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the\nterms of a contract with our customers are satisfied. This occurs when control of the coal is transferred to our customers.\nFor coal shipments to domestic customers via rail, control is generally transferred when the railcar is loaded. Control is\ntransferred for export coal shipments to customers via ocean vessel when the vessel is loaded at the port.\nOur coal sales generally include up to 90-day payment terms following the transfer of control of the goods to\nour customer. In the case of some of our foreign customers, our contracts also require that letters of credit are posted to\nsecure payment of any outstanding receivable. We do not include extended payment terms in our contracts. Our\ncontracts with customers typically provide for minimum specifications or qualities of the coal we deliver. Variances\nfrom these specifications or qualities are settled by means of price adjustments. Generally, these price adjustments are\nsettled within 30 days of delivery and are insignificant.\nCertain of our contracts with customers include provisions in which the price is derived from an index. If\ncontrol of the goods transfers to the customer in the period before the final price is determined, revenue is recorded\nbased on the estimated consideration to be received. The Company estimates the amount to which it expects to receive\nby reference to forward curve data, if available, and generally does not constrain such estimates for accounting purposes\n96\nTable of Contents\ndue to the short period of time over which the uncertainty is resolved. However, certain estimates of provisional pricing\nfor which no forward curve data was available were constrained at December 31, 2023 due to index volatility.\nFreight Revenue and Expense—Costs incurred to transport coal to the point of sale at the port facility are\nincluded in cost of sales and the gross amounts billed to customers to cover shipping to and handling of the coal at the\nport are included in revenue.\nCash and Cash Equivalents—We classify all highly-liquid instruments with an original maturity of\nthree months or less as cash equivalents. Restricted cash balances at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were\n$0.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively, and consisted of funds held in escrow for potential future workers’\ncompensation claims. Restricted cash balances were included in other current assets on the balance sheet. The Company\npools individual bank accounts with the same institution for the purpose of assessing if a bank overdraft exists based on\nthe contractual terms of the arrangement.\nInventories— Coal is reported as inventory at the point in time it is extracted from the mine. Coal inventories\nare valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out inventory\nvaluation method. Coal inventory costs include labor, supplies, equipment costs, freight, operating overhead,\ndepreciation and amortization. Coal inventory quantities are adjusted periodically based on aerial surveys of coal\nstockpiles. Lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments were not material. Supply inventories are valued at average\ncost. Inventories consisted of the following:\n(In thousands) D ecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nRaw coal $ 20,122 $ 22,414\nSaleable coal 12,013 18,223\nSupplies 5,028 4,336\nTotal inventories $ 37,163 $ 44,973\nProperty, Plant and Equipment—Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures which extend\nthe useful lives of existing plant and equipment are capitalized. Planned major maintenance costs which do not extend\nthe useful lives of existing plant and equipment are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed,\nthe related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any profit or loss on\ndisposition is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.\nCoal exploration costs are expensed as incurred. Coal exploration costs include those incurred to ascertain\nexistence, location, extent or quality of ore or minerals before beginning the development stage of the mine.\nMining property and mineral rights costs represent the costs incurred to acquire the rights to access and mine\ncertain coal property either through deeds, leases, or other conveyance agreements. These costs include the costs of\nacquiring, and accessing mineral reserves, resources and surface areas for mining activities.\nMine development begins when the facts and circumstances clearly establish the presence of a commercial\nmineralized deposit. Capitalized mine development costs represent the costs incurred to prepare mine sites and/or seams\nof coal for future mining. These costs include costs of acquiring, permitting, planning, research, and developing\naccess to identified mineral reserves and other preparations for commercial production as necessary to develop and\npermit the properties for mining activities. When components of capitalized mine development costs are replaced with\nnew components, the Company capitalizes the replacement as a separate component and charges off the net book value\nof the component that was replaced at the cease-use date.\nIf it is determined that an undeveloped mineral interest cannot be economically converted into proven and\nprobable reserves, capitalized costs are assessed for impairment and future development costs are expensed as incurred.\n97\nTable of Contents\nOperating expenditures, including certain professional fees and overhead costs, are not capitalized but are expensed as\nincurred.\nMineral rights and capitalized mine development costs are depleted and amortized on a units-of-production\nbasis as mining of that mine’s assigned reserves takes place. Depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated on the\nstraight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to thirty years.\nAdvanced Coal Royalties—In most cases, we acquire the right to mine coal reserves under leases which call for\nthe payment of royalties on coal as it is mined and sold. In many cases, these mineral leases require the payment of\nadvance or minimum coal royalties to lessors that are recoupable against future production royalties. These advance\npayments are deferred and charged to operations as the coal reserves are mined.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets—We review and evaluate held-and-used long-lived assets, including property,\nplant and equipment and mine development costs, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that\nthe asset or asset group’s carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying\namount of the asset or asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset\nor asset group. If the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows,\nan impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value, if any. We may, under\nlimited circumstances, idle mining operations in response to certain events or conditions. Because an idling is not a\npermanent closure, it is not considered an automatic indicator of impairment.\nAsset Retirement Obligations—Legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets are initially\nrecognized at their estimated fair value, with a corresponding charge to capitalized development costs, at the time they\nare incurred. Our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates related to reclaiming metallurgical\ncoal land and support facilities in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws as defined by each mining permit.\nSpending estimates are adjusted for inflation and then discounted at the credit-adjusted, risk-free rate. We record the fair\nvalue of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in\nthe carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted to its present value over time and the\ncapitalized cost is amortized using the units-of-production method over estimated recoverable reserves upon\ncommencement of mining. We review our asset retirement obligations on at least an annual basis for significant changes\nin the estimated timing or amount of cash flows.\nOccupational Disease (Pneumoconiosis) Obligations. We recognize as a liability to provide for occupational\ndisease (pneumoconiosis) benefits to eligible employees, former employees and dependents as required by the Federal\nMine Safety and Health Act of 1969, as amended. The occupational disease benefit obligation represents the present\nvalue of the actuarially computed liabilities for such benefits over the employees’ applicable years of service.\nEstimating our occupational disease (pneumoconiosis) benefits obligation requires management to make\nestimates and judgments regarding timing and existence of a liability utilizing third-party actuaries to assist in preparing\nwhat constitutes adequate liability amounts. Inherent in the calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments\nincluding the ultimate costs, mortality factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, and timing of settlement. Adjustments to\nestimated liabilities due to changes in actuarial assumptions are recorded immediately in earnings in the period in which\nthe change in estimate occurs.\nOther Income—We recognized $5.4 million associated with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic\nSecurity Act Employee Retention Tax Credit as other income within the consolidated statements of operations for 2021.\nLeases—We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception, and lease classification is\ndetermined at the commencement date. Leases are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and\nlease liabilities except for leases with a term of 12 months or less.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our\nobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are\nrecognized at commencement date based on the present value of the fixed lease payments over the lease term. The\n98\nTable of Contents\nCompany does not separate lease and non-lease components for all leases as permitted under the accounting guidance for\nleases. As most of our leases do not contain a readily determinable implicit rate, we generally use our incremental\nborrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease\npayments at commencement date. The operating and finance lease ROU assets also include lease prepayments made by\nthe Company and are reduced by any lease incentives received by the Company prior to commencement. Our lease terms\nmay include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. For\noperating leases, lease expense is recorded in the income statement based on a straight-line recognition of the total fixed\npayments over the lease term. For finance leases, accretion of the liability is recognized as interest expense and the ROU\nasset is amortized separately on a straight-line basis similar to the depreciation of equipment owned by the Company.\nLeases of mineral reserves and the related land leases are exempted under U.S. GAAP from recognition on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nFair Value Measurements— Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities\nthat are recognized or disclosed at fair value are categorized in the fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the\ninputs utilized in the valuation. The levels of the hierarchy include: Level 1 - inputs are quoted prices in active markets\nfor the identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 - inputs are other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are directly or\nindirectly observable through market-corroborated inputs; and Level 3 - inputs are unobservable, or observable but\ncannot be market-corroborated, requiring us to make assumptions about pricing by market participants.\nThe fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, restricted cash, and accounts payable\napproximate their carrying amounts at each reporting date. The Company’s Senior Notes had an estimated fair value of\n$35.5 million and $36.3 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The fair values of the Company’s Senior\nNotes were based on observable market prices and were considered a Level 2 measurement at December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022 based on trading volumes. The difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the\nCompany’s remaining debts is not material due to the similarity between the terms of the debt agreements and prevailing\nmarket terms available to the Company. Refer to Note 7 for additional information regarding debt.\nNonrecurring fair value measurements of the Company include asset retirement obligations and estimated\nvalues used to allocate the acquisition cost of long-lived assets to individual assets, neither of which are subject to the\nfair value disclosure requirements.\nThe fair value of asset retirement obligations is determined as the present value of estimated cash flows related\nto reclamation obligations, which would likely be a Level 3 measurement due to the use of unobservable inputs such as\nestimates regarding the amount and timing of costs to be incurred, inflation rates, and the Company’s credit-adjusted\ndiscount rate.\nThe consideration for the Company’s prior year acquisitions was allocated based on the relative fair values of\nthe assets acquired, the primary asset of which was mineral rights. The fair values of mineral rights were determined\nbased on Level 3 inputs, which are generally unobservable, requiring the Company to make assumptions about future\ncoal prices, capital expenditures, future coal production, costs of production, and an appropriate rate at which to discount\nthe future cash flows.\nIncome Taxes—Income tax expense (benefit) includes Federal and state income taxes. Certain income and\nexpenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary\ndifferences is reported as deferred income taxes. We account for deferred income taxes by applying statutory tax rates in\neffect at the reporting date of the balance sheet. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that the\nrelated tax benefits will not be realized. In determining the appropriate valuation allowance, we consider the projected\nrealization of tax benefits based on expected levels of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies and\nreversals of existing taxable temporary differences. The Company had no valuation allowances on the balance sheet as\nof December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n99\nTable of Contents\nUncertain tax positions are recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on\nexamination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. We had no uncertain tax positions\nrequiring liability recognition as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. We file income tax returns in the U.S. and in various\nstate and local jurisdictions which may be routinely examined by tax authorities. The statute of limitations for\nexamination of the Company’s tax filings by taxing authorities is currently open for tax returns filed for the year 2020\nand thereafter.\nThe Company recognizes accrued interest related to income tax matters in interest expense, net, separately from\nthe tax provision recorded in income tax expense on the income statement.\nSegment Reporting—Our properties located in West Virginia and Virginia each consist of mineral reserves for\nproduction of metallurgical coal from both underground and surface mines. These operations are within the Appalachian\nbasin. Geology, coal transportation routes to customers, regulatory environments and coal quality or type are\ncharacteristic to a basin. For financial reporting purposes, these operations represent a single segment because each\npossesses similar production methods, distribution methods, and customer quality and consumption characteristics,\nresulting in similar long-term expected financial performance.\nThe Ramaco Coal acquisition in 2022, as discussed in greater detail in Note 4, provides the Company with\nroyalty savings and controlled mineral rights near Sheridan, Wyoming. This property includes a thermal coal deposit and\npermit and is currently undergoing mineral analysis and core drilling to assess potential concentrations of rare earth\nelements. The property also includes a research and pilot facility related to the Company’s possible expansion into the\nmanufacturing and commercialization of advanced carbon products and materials from coal. Research and development\nexpenses related to advanced carbon products and materials are not yet material for separate disclosure. Ramaco is also a\nparty to certain collaborative arrangements with government researchers and other organizations, which involve\nproviding in-kind contributions such as ores, samples, feedstock, and services.\nThe activities at the Sheridan property represent a separate operating segment and have economic and\ngeographic differences compared to the Company’s metallurgical operations in the Appalachian basin. Nonetheless,\nthese activities do not meet the significance tests for separate disclosure as a reportable segment at this time.\nThe chief operating decision maker does not regularly review segment asset information for the purpose of\nassessing performance and making resource allocation decisions.\nStock-Based Compensation—Compensation cost for equity awards is based on the grant-date fair value of the\naward and is recognized over the requisite service period. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.\nThe fair values of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards having only a service condition were\ndetermined using the publicly-traded price of our common stock on the grant date. The fair value of performance stock\nunits, which vest based on the achievement of relative total shareholder return goals, was determined on the date of grant\nbased on a Monte Carlo simulation. The fair value of stock option awards was calculated using the Black-Scholes\noption-pricing model. The Black-Scholes model requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the variables\nused in the calculation, including the expected term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, dividend rate and service\nperiod.\nConcentrations—Our current operations are all related to metallurgical coal within the mining industry. A\nreduction in metallurgical coal prices or other disturbances in the metallurgical coal markets could have an adverse effect\non our financial results. In 2023, 2022, and 2021, approximately 33%, 58%, and 51%, respectively, of our revenue was\nderived from coal shipments to customers in North American markets. The decrease in North American revenue in 2023\nwas due to sales within the United States.\nDuring 2023, sales to three customers accounted for 15%, 13%, and 13% of our revenues, or collectively 41%\nof total revenue. During 2022, sales to two customers accounted for 21% and 17% of our revenues, or collectively 38%\nof total revenue. During 2021, sales to three customers accounted for 30%, 15%, and 13% of our revenues, or\n100\nTable of Contents\ncollectively 58% of total revenue. The number of customers comprising the concentrations above is based on a threshold\nof 10% or more of total revenues.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of\ncash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and accounts receivable. We monitor the credit ratings and concentration of\nrisk with financial institutions on a continuing basis to safeguard our cash deposits. In addition, the Company is party to\nan arrangement that began in 2023 whereby our cash and cash equivalents are placed at various banks in amounts no\ngreater than the $250,000 FDIC-insured limit to help safeguard against potential losses in the financial sector.\nWe have a limited number of customers. Contracts with these customers provide for billings principally upon\nshipment and compliance with payment terms is monitored on an ongoing basis. Outstanding receivables beyond\npayment terms are promptly investigated and discussed with the specific customer. We estimate an allowance for credit\nlosses by taking into consideration the age of past due accounts and an assessment of our customers’ ability to pay. An\nallowance for credit losses was not necessary as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThree customers accounted for 22%, 19%, and 15%, of our trade receivables, or collectively 56% of the\nCompany’s accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2023. The number of customers comprising the concentrations\nabove is based on a threshold of 10% or more of total accounts receivable.\nRecent Accounting Standards Updates\nIn October 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(“ASU”) 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update\nand Simplification Initiative (“ASU 2023-06”). The amendments in ASU 2023-06 clarify or improve disclosure and\npresentation requirements for a variety of topics, including debt and earnings per share. The effective date for each\namendment in ASU 2023-06 will be the effective date of the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure from existing SEC\nregulations, and each amendment should be applied prospectively after its effective date. A material impact to our\ndisclosures is not expected at this time since the Company is already subject to existing SEC disclosure requirements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”). The amendments in ASU 2023-07 require incremental disclosures\nrelated to a public entity’s reportable segments and increase the frequency with which most segment disclosures are\nmade. Incremental disclosures required by the ASU include significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief\noperating decision maker (“CODM”) and included within the segment’s measure of profit or loss, the title and position\nof the CODM and an explanation how the CODM uses the reported measure of a segment’s profit or loss to assess\nperformance and allocate resources, and the amount and composition of other segment items necessary to reconcile\nsegment revenue, significant expenses, and the reported measure of profit or loss. The ASU also expands interim\ndisclosure requirements such that nearly all annual quantitative segment disclosures will be made on an interim basis and\nrequires that entities with a single reportable segment provide all segment disclosures that are not evident from the\nprimary financial statements, including significant segment expenses, consistent with the approach used by management\nto evaluate performance. ASU 2023-07 is effective starting with Ramaco’s 2024 annual financial statements and on a\nquarterly basis thereafter. Retrospective application is required. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the\nASU; however, incremental disclosures will likely occur upon adoption.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). The amendments in ASU 2023-09 require reporting entities to disclose annual income\ntaxes paid, net of refunds, disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes and to provide additional disaggregated\ninformation for individual jurisdictions that equal or exceed 5% of total income taxes paid, net of refunds. ASU 2023-09\nalso requires public business entities to disclose additional categories of information about federal, state, and foreign\nincome taxes in their annual rate reconciliation table and provide more information about some categories if the\nquantitative threshold is met. The ASU will also require disclosure of amounts and percentages in the annual rate\nreconciliation table, rather than amounts or percentages, and will eliminate certain existing disclosure requirements\nrelated to uncertain tax positions and unrecognized deferred tax liabilities. ASU 2023-09 is effective starting with\nRamaco’s 2025 annual financial statements and may be applied prospectively to only the income tax disclosures\n101\nTable of Contents\nprovided for 2025 or retrospectively by providing revised disclosures for all periods presented. Early adoption is\npermitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU; however, incremental disclosures will likely be\nprovided on a prospective basis in the Company’s 2025 annual financial statements upon adoption.\nNOTE 3—PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty, plant, and equipment consisted of the following:\nDecem be r 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nPlant and equipment $ 290,060 $ 232,885\nMining property and mineral rights 120,532 120,760\nConstruction in process 13,984 34,698\nCapitalized mine development costs 174,260 153,436\nLess: accumulated depreciation, depletion, and amortization (139,745) (111,937)\nTotal property, plant, and equipment, net $ 459,091 $ 429,842\nCapitalized amounts related to coal reserves at properties where we are not currently engaged in mining\noperations totaled $17.4 million as of December 31, 2023 and $33.4 million as of December 31, 2022.\nOn July 10, 2022, the Company experienced a methane ignition at the Berwind No. 1 mine, which was one of\nthe active mines at our Berwind mining complex. The other mines resumed production while the Berwind No. 1 mine\nwas idled until a full investigation could be conducted. There were no personnel in the mine at the time of the incident\nand no injuries or fatalities occurred. The overall impact to pre-tax earnings in 2022 was immaterial except for idle mine\ncosts of $9.5 million recognized during the year. Production from the Berwind No. 1 mine restarted in the first quarter of\n2023. The Company received $9.2 million of insurance proceeds during 2023 related to this matter, which have been\nreported as part of Insurance proceeds related to property, plant, and equipment in the investing activities section of the\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows, and recognized a gain of $8.1 million in Other income (expense), net on the\nConsolidated Statement of Operations in 2023 as the Company had previously accrued a $1.1 million recovery asset at\nDecember 31, 2022.\nMining property and mineral rights are made up primarily of significant asset acquisitions that occurred in 2022\nand 2021. Refer to Note 4 for more information.\nDepreciation, depletion, and amortization included:\nYear ended December 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nDepreciation of plant and equipment $ 30,913 $ 24,132 $ 17,945\nAmortization of right-of-use assets (finance leases) 8,547 4,846 1,109\nAmortization and depletion of capitalized\nmine development costs and mineral rights 14,792 12,216 7,151\nTotal depreciation, depletion, and amortization $ 54,252 $ 41,194 $ 26,205\nNOTE 4—ACQUISITIONS\nRamaco Coal\nOn April 29, 2022, the acquisition of Ramaco Coal, an entity owned by an investment fund managed by\nYorktown Partners and certain members of the Company's management, was completed pursuant to a Purchase and Sale\nAgreement, dated February 23, 2022. The purchase price was approximately $65 million, consisting of an initial\npayment of $10 million paid at closing and a deferred purchase price of $55 million paid during the remainder of 2022 in\n102\nTable of Contents\n$5 million ratable quarterly installments, and $10 million ratable quarterly installments paid in 2023 plus interest at a\nrate of 9%.\nRamaco Coal controls certain coal mineral interests of principally metallurgical coal properties which are\nowned in fee or leased under long-term leases that are, in turn, leased or subleased to the Company and various third\nparties. Such lessees pay a royalty based on the amount of metallurgical coal mined and the realized price per ton.\nRamaco Coal also controls a large thermal coal deposit and permit near Sheridan, Wyoming covering\napproximately 16 thousand acres, including a research and development facility and associated equipment and has a goal\nof converting coal to carbon products, such as graphene, graphite and carbon fiber.\nConcurrent with this acquisition, the Company and Ramaco Coal each sold certain mineral rights located in\nWest Virginia (the “Split Ridge Arrangement”). To compensate for the sale of these rights, we received an overriding\nroyalty arrangement which included $2 million up front and $125 thousand quarterly minimum royalty payment\nbeginning in January 2024 until December 2028. The fair value of this arrangement was $3.7 million, of which, $1.6\nmillion was treated as an allocation of the fair value of this disposed component of Ramaco Coal and, separately, a $2.1\nmillion gain on the sale of the Company’s mineral rights included in Other income (expense), net on the 2022\nConsolidated Statement of Operations.\nThe acquisition of Ramaco Coal was accounted for as a purchase of assets due to substantially all of the fair\nvalue being concentrated in a single asset, the rights to metallurgical coal deposits. The consideration paid in connection\nwith the acquisition of Ramaco Coal, including $1.6 million in closing costs, relinquishment of $1.6 million of prepaid\nroyalties and $0.1 million paid to a mineral owner as part of the acquisition, was approximately $68.3 million and was\nallocated based on fair values to mining property and mineral rights ($65.1 million), buildings ($2.6 million) and\nequipment ($0.6 million). Refer to Note 7 for a description of the acquisition financing.\nMaben Coal\nOn September 23, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of Maben\nCoal, LLC (“Maben Coal”) pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement dated August 8, 2022, with Appleton Coal,\nLLC. The purchase price was approximately $30.0 million, consisting of an initial payment of $9.0 million and proceeds\nfrom a new two-year loan in the amount of $21.0 million. The Company also paid approximately $1.7 million of\ntransaction costs and recognized liabilities of $1.3 million on the closing date, primarily related to $1.2 million of cash\nbond replacement obligations incurred by the Company as part of the transaction. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the\nCompany paid off the $1.2 million cash bond replacement obligation to Appleton Coal, LLC, which was included in the\ninvesting activities section of the statement of cash flows. The $1.2 million bond replacement payment was subsequently\nrecovered in 2023, which reduced the cash investment related to this transaction to $10.7 million.\nWe acquired a large coal deposit on approximately 28 thousand leased acres located in Wyoming County and\nRaleigh County, West Virginia. We assumed existing mining permits issued by the West Virginia Department of\nEnvironmental Protection, which authorizes mining by both surface and highwall mining methods as well as by\nunderground methods. The property also has issued permits covering an existing haul road, as well as an active refuse\ndisposal area together with a preparation plant and unit train loadout, neither of which had been constructed as of the\nclosing date.\nThe acquisition of Maben Coal was accounted for as a purchase of assets due to substantially all of the fair\nvalue being concentrated in a single asset, the rights to leased metallurgical coal deposits. The total consideration of\napproximately $33.0 million was allocated to mining property and mineral rights ($30.6 million), capitalized mine\ndevelopment costs ($1.0 million), receivable for the right to recover cash bond replacement payments made by the\nCompany as discussed above ($1.2 million, which was received in 2023), and recoupable royalties ($0.2 million). Refer\nto Note 7 for information regarding the acquisition financing.\n103\nTable of Contents\nAmonate Assets\nIn December 2021, we acquired what are referred to as the “Amonate Assets” from Coronado, pursuant to an\nasset purchase agreement. The acquisition, for a total cash consideration of $30 million, included a mine complex\nlocated in McDowell County, West Virginia and Tazewell County, Virginia adjacent and contiguous to the Company’s\nexisting Berwind Complex. The acquisition primarily consists of high-quality, low and mid-vol metallurgical coal\nreserves and resources, much of which will be mined from the Company’s Berwind Complex. Also purchased were\nseveral additional permitted mines and a currently idled 1.3-million-ton per annum capacity coal preparation plant. The\nCompany paid an additional $0.6 million in 2023 for transaction-related costs, which was also included in investing\nactivities since the delay in payment was due to administrative reasons rather than financing.\nNOTE 5—ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\nWe estimate asset retirement obligations (“ARO”) for final reclamation based upon detailed engineering\ncalculations of the amount and timing of the future cash spending for a third party to perform the required work.\nAmounts recorded related to asset retirement obligations were as follows:\nDecem be r 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nBalance at beginning of year $ 28,885 $ 22,549\nAdditional asset retirement obligations acquired/incurred 542 1,440\nExpenditures made — —\nAccretion expense 1,403 1,115\nRevisions to estimates (1,870) 3,781\nBalance at end of year $ 28,960 $ 28,885\nNOTE 6—ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES\nAccrued liabilities at December 31, 2023 consisted of accrued compensation of $14.6 million and various other\nliabilities. Accrued expenses at December 31, 2022 consisted of accrued compensation of $12.1 million and various\nother liabilities. The Company sponsors a defined contribution plan to assist eligible employees in providing for their\nfuture retirement needs. Contribution expenses related to the plan totaled $3.1 million, $2.3 million, and $1.2 million for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nOther long-term liabilities were comprised primarily of worker’s compensation and occupational disease\nobligations discussed below.\nWorkers’ Compensation and Occupational Disease Obligations\nWe are self-insured for certain losses relating to workers’ compensation claims and occupational disease\nobligations under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1969, as amended. Starting in 2023, the Company also\nelected to self-insure employee medical expenses. We purchase insurance coverage to reduce our exposure to significant\nlevels of these claims. Self-insured losses are accrued based upon estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured\nclaims incurred as of the balance sheet date using claims data and actuarial assumptions. The occupational disease\nbenefit obligation represents the present value of the actuarially computed liabilities for such benefits over the\nemployees’ applicable years of service. The occupational disease benefit liability was calculated using a discount rate of\n5.3% and 5.6% at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the estimated aggregate liability for uninsured claims totaled $5.2 million, including\n$2.3 million of occupational disease obligations. Of the aggregate liability, $3.1 million was included in Other long-term\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2022, the estimated aggregate liability for uninsured\nclaims totaled $3.6 million, including $1.5 million of occupational disease obligations.

We are authorized to issue up to a total of 225,000,000 shares of Class A\ncommon stock and 35,000,000 shares of Class B common stock as well as 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, each\nhaving a par value of $0.01 per share.\nThe initial distribution of Class B common stock occurred on June 21, 2023 via a stock dividend to existing\nholders of common stock as of May 12, 2023. On the date of initial distribution, each holder of common stock received\n0.2 shares of Class B common stock for every one share of existing common stock held on the record date. Similar\nactions or modifications occurred for holders of outstanding stock-based awards.\nThe distribution of the Class B common stock provides existing holders of the Company’s common stock with\nan opportunity to participate directly in the financial performance of the Company’s CORE assets on a stand-alone basis,\nseparate from the Company’s metallurgical coal operations. CORE assets were acquired initially as part of the\nCompany’s acquisition of Ramaco Coal in the second quarter of 2022. The financial performance of CORE assets\nconsists of the following non-cost-bearing revenue streams based on the Company’s current expectations:\n• Royalty fees derived from the royalties associated with the Ramaco Coal and Amonate reserves, which we\nbelieve approximates 3% of Company-produced coal sales revenue excluding coal sales revenue from Knox\nCreek,\n• Infrastructure fees based on $5.00 per ton of coal processed at our preparation plants and $2.50 per ton of\nloaded coal at the Company’s rail load-out facilities, and\n• Future income derived, if and when realized, from advanced carbon products and rare earth elements initiatives.\n108\nTable of Contents\nThe Company expects to pay a dividend equal to 20% of the total fees above; however, any dividend amounts\ndeclared and paid are subject to the sole discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors.\nIn addition, the Board of Directors retains the power to change or add expense allocation policies related to\nCORE, redefine CORE assets, and redetermine CORE’s per-ton usage fees at any time, in its sole discretion, without\nshareholder approval. Holders of shares of Class A common stock continue to be entitled to receive dividends when and\nif declared by the Board of Directors subject to any statutory or contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and\nto any prior rights and preferences that may be applicable to outstanding preferred stock, if any.\nCORE is not a separate legal entity and holders of Class B common stock do not own a direct interest in the\nassets of CORE. Holders of Class B common stock are stockholders of Ramaco Resources, Inc. and are subject to all\nrisks and liabilities of the Company as a whole.\nWith respect to voting rights, holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a\nsingle class on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders and are entitled to one vote per share. The holders of\nClass A common stock and Class B common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors.\nClass B common stock does not have any specific voting rights or governance rights with respect to CORE.\nWith respect to liquidation rights, holders of common stock are entitled to receive ratably the assets available\nfor distribution to the stockholders after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preference of outstanding preferred\nstock, if any. That is, the rights to residual net assets upon liquidation are equal between holders of Class A and Class B\ncommon stock. Holders of Class B common stock do not have specific rights to CORE assets in the event of liquidation.\nShares of Class A common stock have no preemptive or conversion rights and are not subject to further calls or\nassessment by us. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to Class A common stock. The Board\nof Directors retains the ability, in its sole discretion, to exchange all outstanding shares of Class B common stock into\nClass A common stock based on an exchange ratio determined by a 20-day trailing volume-weighted average price for\neach class of stock.\nThe initial distribution of the tracking stock was recorded as a stock dividend at fair value, which was estimated\nto be $11.00 per share based on the closing price of Class B shares on the first day of regular-way trading. The effect of\nthe equity restructuring was a $102.9 million reduction in retained earnings and an increase of $102.9 million to Class B\ncommon stock and additional paid-in capital during the second quarter of 2023. The Company initially distributed\n8,201,956 shares of Class B common shares as well as additional restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance\nstock units discussed below.\nStock-Based Compensation Awards\nOutstanding stock-based awards were reclassified to Class A common stock as part of the equity restructuring\ndiscussed above. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Company’s outstanding stock-based awards, equitable\nadjustments were made in accordance with such terms, as discussed below, based on the same factor of 0.2 for every\noutstanding award. Since there were no changes in fair value, vesting conditions, or award classification, no incremental\ncompensation expense resulted.\nOur Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) is currently authorized by shareholders for the issuance of awards of\nup to approximately 10.9 million shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2023, there were approximately 4.6\nmillion shares of common stock available for grant under the LTIP. The one-time distribution of Class B has no bearing\non the authorization under the LTIP.\nIn general, granted but unvested shares are forfeited upon termination of employment, unless an employee\nenters into another written arrangement. However, exceptions exist for certain executives that are entitled to accelerated\nvesting if terminated without cause. Granted but unvested shares may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or\notherwise encumbered.\n109\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had four types of stock-based awards outstanding: stock options, restricted stock,\nrestricted stock units, and performance stock units. Stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based awards totaled\n$12.9 million in 2023, $8.2 million in 2022, and $5.3 million in 2021.\nStock Options—We granted options for the purchase of a total of 937,424 shares of our common stock for $5.34\nper share to two executives on August 31, 2016. The options have a ten-year term from the grant date and are fully\nvested. During the third quarter of 2022, options to purchase 20,000 shares of common stock options with an intrinsic\nvalue of $0.124 million were exercised, leaving a balance of options to purchase 917,424 shares of common stock at\nDecember 31, 2022. During 2023, stock options of 183,484 shares of Class B awards were distributed to these\nindividuals under the equitable adjustments discussed above. During the fourth quarter of 2023, options to purchase\n168,712 shares of Class A common stock were exercised and stock options for 33,742 shares of Class B common stock\nwere exercised having a combined intrinsic value of $2.6 million. The remaining options outstanding and unexercised at\nDecember 31, 2023 were 748,712 for Class A common stock and 149,742 for Class B common stock, which were in-\nthe-money at December 31, 2023, having a total intrinsic value of $10.9 million. No compensation expense was\nrecognized for these awards in 2023, 2022, or 2021 as the awards became fully vested in previous years.\nThe following table summarizes the remaining stock-based awards outstanding, as well as activity for the\nperiods:\nRestri c te d Stock Restrict ed S tock Units Performa nc e S tock Units\nWeighted Weighted Weighted\nAverage Grant Average Grant Average Grant\nFor Class A common stock: Shares D ate Fair Value Shares Date Fair Value Shares Date Fair Value\nOutstanding at\nDecember 31, 2021 3,741,770 $ 3.98 — $ — — $ —\nGranted 214,363 14.59 248,706 15.65 248,706 22.21\nVested (809,539) 6.57 (82,903) 15.65 — —\nForfeited (637) 15.65 — — — —\nOutstanding at\nDecember 31, 2022 3,145,957 $ 4.04 165,803 $ 15.65 248,706 $ 22.21\nGranted 296,115 10.61 518,348 10.61 518,348 18.09\nVested (1,695,234) 3.37 (82,903) 15.65 — —\nForfeited (38,484) 11.90 — — — —\nOutstanding at\nDecember 31, 2023 1,708,354 $ 5.66 601,248 $ 11.30 767,054 $ 19.43\nFor Class B common stock:\nInitial distribution of Class\nB awards - June 21, 2023 680,718 136,819 153,404\nVested (339,035) (16,578) —\nOutstanding at\nDecember 31, 2023 341,683 120,241 153,404\nThe total fair value of awards vested was $19.7 million during 2023, $11.0 million during 2022, and $5.1\nmillion during 2021.\nRestricted Stock—We grant shares of restricted stock to certain senior executives, key employees and directors.\nThese shares vest over approximately one to three and a half years from the date of grant. During the vesting period, the\nparticipants have voting rights and may receive dividends. Upon vesting, the restricted stock becomes unrestricted\ncommon shares. The fair value of the restricted stock on the date of the grant is amortized ratably over the service\nperiod. At December 31, 2023, there was $3.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested\nrestricted stock to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years. The fair value of restricted stock awards\nthat vested during 2023 was $14.6 million for Class A awards and $3.6 million for Class B awards. The fair value of the\noutstanding restricted stock awards was $29.3 million for Class A awards and $4.5 million for Class B awards based on\nthe year-end 2023 closing stock prices.\n110\nTable of Contents\nRestricted Stock Units—We grant shares of restricted stock units to certain senior executives and key\nemployees. These share units vest ratably over approximately three years from the date of grant. During the vesting\nperiod, the participants have no voting rights and no dividend rights; however, participants are entitled to receive\ndividend equivalents, which shall be subject to the same conditions applicable to the units and payable at the time the\nunits vest. Upon vesting and within 30 days thereafter, the recipient will receive one share of common stock for each\nstock unit.\nThe grant date fair values of restricted stock units are recognized ratably over the service period. At December\n31, 2023, there was $5.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units to be\nrecognized over the weighted average period of 1.7 years. The fair value of restricted stock unit awards that vested\nduring 2023 was $1.3 million for Class A awards and $0.2 million for Class B awards. The fair value of the outstanding\nrestricted stock unit awards was $10.3 million for Class A awards and $1.6 million for Class B awards based on the year-\nend 2023 closing stock prices.\nPerformance Stock Units—We grant shares of performance stock units to certain senior executives and key\nemployees. These share units cliff-vest approximately three years from the date of grant based on the achievement of\ntargeted performance levels related to pre-established relative total shareholder return goals. These performance stock\nunits have the potential to be earned from 0% to 200% of target depending on actual results. During the vesting period,\nthe participants have no voting rights and no dividend rights; however, participants are entitled to receive dividend\nequivalents, which shall be subject to the same conditions applicable to the units and payable at the time the units vest.\nUpon vesting and within 30 days thereafter, the recipient will receive one share of common stock for each stock unit.\nThe Company’s performance stock units were valued relative to the stock price performance of a peer group of\ncompanies, which was based on a Monte Carlo simulation. The fair value of the performance stock units on the date of\nthe grant is recognized ratably over the service period. At December 31, 2023, there was $8.9 million of total\nunrecognized compensation cost related to unvested performance stock units to be recognized over the weighted average\nperiod of 1.7 years. The combined intrinsic value of the outstanding performance stock units for both classes, at target,\nwas $15.2 million at December 31, 2023. The value of these awards if the performance period had ended on December\n31, 2023 is estimated at approximately $27 million.\nIn addition, performance stock units granted in 2022 were modified during the first quarter of 2023.\nModifications to these awards were made up primarily of changes in the composition of the peer group as well as\nchanges in the way relative total shareholder return is evaluated against the updated peer group. The modification\nresulted in incremental fair value of $1.2 million, which is recognized as expense over 2023 and 2024.\nPerformance stock units are accounted for as awards with a market condition since vesting depends on total\nshareholder return relative to a group of peer companies.\nTaxes Related to Stock Awards—The Company routinely allows employees to surrender common stock to pay\nestimated taxes upon the vesting or exercise of stock-based compensation awards. The value of common stock tendered\nby employees is determined based on the price of the Company’s common stock at the time of relinquishment. There\nwere no other repurchases of common shares.\nDividends\nDividends in the amount of $16.6 million, or approximately $0.375 per share on an aggregated basis ($0.125\nper share for three quarterly dividends), were declared and paid to holders of common stock or Class A common stock\nduring 2023. On December 6, 2023, the Company announced that the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on\nClass A common stock of $0.1375 per share to be paid on March 15, 2024 to shareholders of record on March 1, 2024.\nDividends of $6.0 million were accrued in December 2023 for the cash dividend to be paid in March 2024.\n111\nTable of Contents\nThe Company also paid dividends to holders of Class B common stock during 2023 based on 20% of CORE\nroyalty and infrastructure fees. Dividends in the amount of $1.5 million, or approximately $0.165 per share of Class B\ncommon stock, were paid on September 15, 2023 to shareholders of record on September 1, 2023. Dividends in the\namount of $2.2 million, or $0.249 per share of Class B common stock, were paid on December 15, 2023 to shareholders\nof record on December 1, 2023. Refer to Note 15 for information regarding dividends declared for holders of Class B\ncommon stock subsequent to the date of the financial statements.\nFor the full year 2023, the Company recognized $27.5 million of cash dividends declared against retained\nearnings for all classes of common stock, including $6.0 million of dividends declared in December 2023 to be paid in\nMarch 2024 and $1.2 million of forfeitable dividends subject to the vesting conditions of outstanding restricted stock\nunits and performance stock units. For the full year 2023, the Company paid $25.8 million of cash dividends for both\nclasses of common stock, including $5.5 million that were accrued at December 31, 2022.\nFor 2022, the Company recognized $23.1 million of cash dividends declared against retained earnings, or\napproximately $0.52 per share, including $5.5 million that were unpaid as of December 31, 2022. For the full year 2022,\nthe Company paid $20.0 million of dividends, including $2.5 million that were accrued at December 31, 2021.\nNOTE 10—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nEnvironmental Liabilities—Environmental liabilities are recognized when the expenditures are considered\nprobable and can be reasonably estimated. Measurement of liabilities is based on currently enacted laws and regulations,\nexisting technology and undiscounted site-specific costs. Generally, such recognition would coincide with a commitment\nto a formal plan of action. No amounts have been recognized for environmental liabilities.\nSurety Bond—In accordance with state laws, we are required to post reclamation bonds to assure that\nreclamation work is completed. We also have a small amount of surety bonds that secure performance obligations.\nBonds outstanding at December 31, 2023 totaled approximately $27.2 million.\nCoal Leases and Associated Royalty Commitments—We lease coal reserves under agreements that require\nroyalties to be paid as the coal is mined and sold. Many of these agreements require minimum annual royalties to be paid\nregardless of the amount of coal mined and sold. Total royalty expenses were $35.0 million, $34.2 million, and $18.5\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. These agreements generally have terms\nrunning through exhaustion of all the mineable and merchantable coal covered by the respective lease. Royalties or\nthroughput payments are based on a percentage of the gross selling price received for the coal we mine. Minimum\nroyalty obligations under coal leases total $27.2 million and are broken down as follows: $3.3 million for 2024, $3.3\nmillion for 2025, $3.2 million for 2026, $3.2 million for 2027, $3.2 million for 2028, and $11.0 million thereafter. Refer\nto Note 12 for information regarding related party transactions.\nContingent Transportation Purchase Commitments—We secure the ability to transport coal through rail\ncontracts and export terminals that are sometimes funded through take-or-pay arrangements. As of December 31, 2023,\nthe Company’s remaining commitments under take-or-pay arrangements totaled $20.2 million, most of which relates to a\nfive-year contract that was entered into during 2023 with a total remaining commitment of $20.0 million. The five-year\ncontract, which runs from April 1, 2023 through March 31, 2028, includes an annual minimum commitment of $4.5\nmillion. The level of these commitments will be reduced at a per ton rate as such rail and export terminal services are\nutilized against the required minimum tonnage amounts over the contract term stipulated in such rail and export terminal\ncontracts. We recognized $0.8 million of contingent liabilities at December 31, 2023 related to the probable shortfall\nassociated with our annual minimum commitment.\nLitigation—From time to time, we are subject to various litigation and other claims in the normal course of\nbusiness. No amounts have been accrued in the consolidated financial statements with respect to any matters.\n112\nTable of Contents\nOn November 5, 2018, one of our three raw coal storage silos that fed our Elk Creek plant experienced a partial\nstructural failure. A temporary conveying system completed in late-November 2018 restored approximately 80% of our\nplant capacity. We completed a permanent belt workaround and restored the preparation plant to its full processing\ncapacity in mid-2019. Our insurance carrier, Federal Insurance Company, disputed our claim for coverage based on\ncertain exclusions to the applicable policy and, therefore, on August 21, 2019, we filed suit against Federal Insurance\nCompany and Chubb INA Holdings, Inc. in Logan County Circuit Court in West Virginia seeking a declaratory\njudgment that the partial silo collapse was an insurable event and to require coverage under our policy. Defendants\nremoved the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, and upon removal, we\nsubstituted ACE American Insurance Company as a defendant in place of Chubb INA Holdings, Inc. The trial in the\nmatter commenced on June 29, 2021, in Charleston, West Virginia.\nOn July 15, 2021, the jury returned a verdict in our favor for $7.7 million in contract damages and on July 16,\n2021, made an additional award of $25.0 million for damages for wrongful denial of the claim under Hayseeds, Inc. v.\nState Farm Fire & Cas., 177 W. Va. 323, 352 S.E. 2d 73 (W. Va. 1986), including inconvenience and aggravation. On\nAugust 12, 2021, the defendants filed a post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law or in the alternative to alter or\namend the judgment or for a new trial. On March 4, 2022, the court entered its memorandum opinion and order on the\nmotion reducing the jury award to a total of $1.8 million, including pre-judgment interest, and also vacated and set aside,\nin its entirety, the jury award of Hayseeds damages. The same day, the court entered the judgment in accordance with the\nmemorandum opinion and order.\nOn April 1, 2022, we filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. On July 20,\n2023, the court rendered a decision reinstating the jury’s $7.7 million contract damages verdict. The court further\ndetermined that we are entitled to attorney’s fees in an amount to be determined on remand. Finally, the court held that\nwe are entitled to Hayseeds damages for wrongful denial of the claim but remanded for a new trial on the amount of\nsuch damages after affirming that the original $25 million award was excessive. On August 3, 2023, the Defendants-\nAppellees filed a Petition of Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc with the Fourth Circuit. The petition was denied by order\ndated August 15, 2023. On August 29, 2023, the court clarified that the amount of attorney’s fees to be determined on\nremand included appellate fees. On September 8, 2023, the court entered its amended judgment, which awarded post-\njudgment interest on the previously awarded and reinstated verdict related to contract (compensatory) damages and the\nFourth Circuit thereafter issued its mandate on October 2, 2023. The matter is now pending before the District Court for\na new trial on damages for inconvenience and aggravation as well as the court’s determination and award of attorney’s\nfees.\nThe defendants fully paid the portion of the judgment related to contract (compensatory) damages in the court’s\norder and that portion of the matter is considered closed. The Company recognized a $7.8 million gain during 2023,\nwhich was recorded in Other income (expense), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of this amount, $2.0\nmillion was included in Insurance proceeds related to property, plant, and equipment as part of investing activities on\nthe Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the remaining amount was included in operating activities.\nNOTE 11—REVENUES\nOur revenue is derived from contracts for the sale of coal and is recognized when the performance obligations\nunder the contracts are satisfied, which is at the point in time control is transferred to our customer. Generally, domestic\nsales contracts have terms of about one year and the pricing is typically fixed. Export sales have spot or term contracts,\nand pricing can be either a fixed price or a price derived against index-based pricing mechanisms. Sales completed with\n113\nTable of Contents\ndelivery to an export terminal are reported as export revenue. Disaggregated information about our revenue is presented\nbelow:\nYe ar en ded December 31 ,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nCoal Sales\nNorth American revenue $ 227,484 $ 328,322 $ 143,946\nExport revenue, excluding Canada 466,040 237,366 139,448\nTotal revenue $ 693,524 $ 565,688 $ 283,394\nFourth quarter 2023 revenue that can be derived from the Company’s periodic filings includes a $1.3 million\nupward adjustment to revenue related to performance obligations that were satisfied in the previous quarter. Fourth\nquarter 2022 revenue that can be derived from the Company’s periodic filings includes a $2.8 million downward\nadjustment to revenue related to performance obligations that were satisfied in the previous quarter. These adjustments\nwere due to true-ups of previous estimates for provisional pricing provisions.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding performance obligations of approximately 1.4 million\ntons for contracts with fixed sales prices averaging $166 per ton and 2.1 million additional tons for contracts with index-\nbased pricing mechanisms. The Company expects to satisfy approximately 88% of the committed tons in 2024 and the\nremainder in 2025. Variable amounts, including index-based prices, have not been estimated for the purpose of\ndisclosing remaining performance obligations as permitted under the revenue recognition guidance when variable\nconsideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation.\nSales into individual foreign countries equaling or exceeding 10% of our total revenues included Germany and\nCanada, each of which represented 14% of 2023 revenues, as well as Brazil, which represented 10% of 2023 revenues.\nSales into Canada and South Africa were 12% and 10%, respectively, of 2022 revenues.

Therefore, EPS is presented\nfor the Company’s single class of common stock up to the time the tracking stock was issued. EPS is presented\nprospectively under the two-class method starting on the date of initial distribution of the tracking stock. Refer to Note 9\nfor information related to the Company’s tracking stock.\nThe computation of basic and diluted EPS is shown on the following page:\n116\nTable of Contents\n(In thousands, except per share amounts) Years en de d December 3 1 ,\n2023 2022 2021\nEarnings attribution\nSingle class of common stock (through 6/20/2023) * $ 31,382 $ 116,042 $ 39,759\nClass A common stock (6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023) 44,663 — —\nClass A restricted stock awards (6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023) 1,897 — —\nClass B common stock (6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023) 3,498 — —\nClass B restricted stock awards (6/21/2023 - 12/31/2023) 144 — —\nForfeitable dividends declared on unvested stock-based\nawards 729 — —\nNet income $ 82,313 $ 116,042 $ 39,759\n* Common stock and restricted stock participated in earnings 1:1\nand are shown on a combined basis through 6/20/2023 consistent\nwith historical presentation\nJan. 1 - June 20, Years ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nEPS data for single class of common stock through\n6/20/2023\nNumerator\nNet earnings $ 31,382 $ 116,042 $ 39,759\nDenominator\nWeighted average shares used to compute basic earnings\nper share * 44,344 44,164 43,964\nDilutive effect of stock option awards 381 532 293\nDilutive effect of restricted stock units — 6 —\nDilutive effect of performance stock units 27 — —\nWeighted average shares used to compute diluted\nearnings per share 44,752 44,702 44,257\nEarnings per common share (single class of common\nstock)\nBasic $ 0.71 $ 2.63 $ 0.90\nDiluted $ 0.70 $ 2.60 $ 0.90\nJune 21, 2023 - December 31, 2023\nClass A Class B\nEPS data for dual-class common stock 6/21/2023 -\n12/31/2023\nNumerator\nNet earnings $ 44,663 $ 3,498\nDenominator\nWeighted average shares used to compute basic earnings\nper share ** 42,115 8,428\nDilutive effect of stock option awards 482 111\nDilutive effect of restricted stock units 157 48\nDilutive effect of performance stock units 436 111\nWeighted average shares used to compute diluted\nearnings per share 43,190 8,698\nEarnings per common share (dual-class structure)\nBasic $ 1.06 $ 0.42\nDiluted $ 1.03 $ 0.40\n** Does not include unvested restricted stock, which averaged 1.8\nmillion and 0.4 million for Class A and Class B, respectively, for\nthe period June 21, 2023 through December 31, 2023\n117\nTable of Contents\nUnvested restricted stock awards have the right to receive nonforfeitable dividends on the same basis as\ncommon shares; therefore, unvested restricted stock is considered a participating security for the purpose of calculating\nEPS. Historically, the Company has shown EPS for its common stock and unvested restricted stock on a combined basis\nsince both instruments participate in net earnings on the same basis and the resulting EPS is typically the same. Starting\nunder the two-class method, the Company reports separately the net earnings allocated away from holders of Class A\nand Class B common stock to holders of unvested restricted stock awards.\nUnvested restricted stock units and performance stock units include forfeitable dividend rights that are subject\nto the vesting conditions of the underlying awards; therefore, these awards are not considered participating securities and\nshould not be allocated undistributed earnings for the purpose of calculating EPS. However, dividends or dividend\nequivalents declared and charged to retained earnings for these awards reduce the amount of net earnings available for\ndistribution to common stockholders and should be reflected as such under the two-class method.\nFor accounting purposes, Class B’s participation rights are, in substance, discretionary based on the power of\nthe Company’s Board of Directors to add or modify expense allocation policies, redefine CORE assets, and redetermine\nCORE’s per-ton usage fees at any time, in its sole discretion, without shareholder approval. Therefore, no amount of the\nCompany’s net earnings shall be allocated to Class B for the purpose of calculating EPS other than actual dividends\ndeclared during the period for the tracking stock. Refer to Note 9 for information regarding dividends declared on Class\nB common stock.\nDiluted EPS was calculated using the treasury stock method for stock options and restricted stock units. For\nperformance stock units, the awards were first evaluated under the contingently issuable shares guidance, which requires\na determination as to whether shares would be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency\nperiod. For shares determined to be issuable under performance stock unit awards, the treasury stock method was then\napplied to determine the dilutive impact of the awards, if any. Unvested restricted stock awards are considered potential\ncommon shares as well as participating securities, as discussed previously, and were included in diluted EPS using the\nmore dilutive of the treasury stock method or the two-class method. Since these awards share in dividends on a 1:1 basis\nwith common shares, applying the treasury stock method would be antidilutive compared to the basic EPS calculation\nthat allocates earnings to participating securities under the two-class method discussed previously.\nDiluted EPS for the period from January 1, 2023 through June 20, 2023, the period for which a single class of\ncommon stock existed, excluded all outstanding restricted stock units, or 684,151 units in total, because the effect would\nhave been antidilutive under the treasury stock method. In addition, diluted EPS for the same period excluded\noutstanding performance stock units originally granted in 2022, or 248,706 units at target, based on the guidance for\ncontingently issuable shares, which requires exclusion when shares would not be issuable if the end of the reporting\nperiod were the end of the contingency period.\nFor the period from June 21,2023 through December 31, 2023, the Company’s ability to convert Class B\ncommon shares into Class A common shares, as discussed previously in Note 9, is a contingency that will not be\nreflected in the diluted EPS for Class A under the if-converted method until such time that the required Board resolutions\noccur, if ever.\nDiluted EPS for 2022 excluded 248,706 of target performance stock units based on the guidance for\ncontingently issuable shares discussed earlier.\nNOTE 15—SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn February 1, 2024, the Company announced that the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.2416\nper share of Class B common stock, which will be payable on March 15, 2024 to shareholders of record on March 1,\n2024.\nIn February 2024, the Company completed the purchase of an existing coal preparation plant, which will be\nrelocated to the Company’s Maben Complex. The purchase price of the plant is $3 million. The Company anticipates\n118\nTable of Contents\nspending an additional $8 million in initial development capital expenditures related to the plant in 2024. These costs\nwould include amounts related to the relocation, reassembly, and expansion of the facility at Maben.\n* * * * *\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nManagement’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of December 31, 2023, our management,\nunder the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated\nthe effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to applicable Exchange Act rules. Based on this\nevaluation, management concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023 were\nnot effective at the reasonable assurance level as a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial\nreporting disclosed below. The Company’s remediation plan for the material weakness in internal control over financial\nreporting is also discussed below.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Management is responsible for\nestablishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management used the criteria described in\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (“COSO”) to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023. Based on this evaluation, management identified a material weakness related to a pervasive lack of\nsufficient documentation of accounting policies, procedures, and controls. This lack of sufficient documentation does not\nallow management to effectively assess its relevant risks and key controls to properly test for design and operating\neffectiveness. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over\nfinancial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial\nstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management concluded that its internal control over\nfinancial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by\nCherry Bekaert, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.\nRemediation Plan. We are currently developing a plan of remediation to address this material weakness, which\nwill include assessing, redesigning, and implementing modifications of our internal controls. We will not be able to fully\nremediate this material weakness until these steps have been completed and subsequent validation and testing of these\ninternal controls have demonstrated their operating effectiveness over a sustained period of financial reporting cycles.\nOnce the remediation plan is fully developed, we will be implementing process, control, and documentation improvements\nto address the above material weakness that include, but are not limited to, designing and implementing specific\nmanagement review procedures to ensure completeness and accuracy of key financial and non-financial data utilized in\nour business; and implementing improved policies, procedures, and control activities over key financial data to ensure\naccuracy and completeness of this data as used in the aforementioned management review procedures.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Except for the material weakness and remediation actions\ndescribed above, there were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth quarter\nthat materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n119\nTable of Contents\nItem 9B. Other Information\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, none of the Company’s directors or executive officers adopted, modified, or\nterminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (each as defined in Item 408 of\nRegulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), except as follows:\nOn December 12, 2023, Jason Fannin, the Company’s chief commercial officer, adopted a trading plan intended\nto satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c).
